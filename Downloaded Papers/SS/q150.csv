However, not all wells offer basic logs such as sonic and density. This kind of information is significant for characterization in reservoir geophysics. This case study proposes a combination of Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) tools that constitute a type of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and the Ensemble Machine Learning (EML) technique, in the prediction of missing or imputation log data based on the dataset of the Campos Basin. Such machine learning tools are considered robust, fast, and low cost, widely used in several areas. The study explores the combination of MLP and EML in the development of the learning algorithm. The use of MLP was “tuned” with optimal hyperparameters through GridSearch and the EML built through the Voting Estimator technique in a weighted way through the Scikit-learn library. It’s selected well logs like sonic, density, porosity, among other information for training. The velocity profile was selected as the prediction target. The best calculation parameters and errors of ensemble machine learners were generated, and thus, to analyze the generalizability of the algorithms. And finally, the EML Results were compared with the test samples.","",""

Despite their success, the underlying geometry of these representations remains elusive, which obfuscates the quest for more robust, trustworthy, and interpretable models. In particular, mainstream SSL techniques rely on a speciﬁc deep neural network architecture with two cascaded neural networks: the encoder and the projector. When used for transfer learning, the projector is discarded since empirical results show that its representation gen-eralizes more poorly than the encoder’s. In this paper, we investigate this curious phenomenon and analyze how the strength of the data augmentation policies affects the data embedding. We discover a non-trivial relation between the encoder, the projector, and the data augmentation strength: with increasingly larger augmentation policies, the projector, rather than the encoder, is more strongly driven to become invariant to the augmentations. It does so by eliminating crucial information about the data by learning to project it into a low-dimensional space, a noisy estimate of the data manifold tangent plane in the encoder representation. This analysis is substantiated through a geometrical perspective with theoretical and empirical results. by using the representation extracted in the encoder space . Large, moderate, and small augmentations refer to the strength of the data augmentation applied to the input samples (see Table 2 for each conﬁguration). The smaller the strength of the data augmentation policy, the less the projector suffers from dimensional collapse. However, when the projector is affected by a substantial dimensional collapse, the encoder representation becomes suitable for the downstream task. In this work, we demys-tify this intriguing relationship between augmentation strengths, encoder embedding, and projector geometry.","",""

These future estimates can help an autonomous vehicle plan its trajectory and avoid collision. However, under dynamic trafﬁc scenarios, planning based on de- terministic predictions is not trustworthy. Rather, estimating the uncertainty associated with the predicted states with certain level of conﬁdence can lead to robust path planning. Hence, the authors propose to quantify this uncertainty during forecasting using stochastic approximation which deterministic approaches fail to capture. The current method is simple and applies Bayesian approximation during inference to standard neural network architectures for estimating uncertainty. The authors compared the predictions between the probabilistic neural network (NN) models with the standard deterministic models. The results indicate that the mean predicted path of probabilistic models was closer to the ground truth when compared with the deterministic prediction. Further, the effect of stochastic dropout of weights and long-term prediction on future state uncertainty has been studied. It was found that the probabilistic models produced better performance metrics like average displacement error (ADE) and ﬁnal displacement error (FDE).

However, the decoding of gait patterns from brain signals remains an open challenge. The aim of this work is to propose and validate a deep learning model to decode gait phases from Electroenchephalography (EEG).   APPROACH A Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) deep neural network has been trained to deal with time-dependent information within brain signals during locomotion. The EEG signals have been preprocessed by means of Artifacts Subspace Reconstruction (ASR) and Reliable Independent Component Analysis (RELICA) to ensure that classification performance was not affected by movement-related artifacts.   MAIN RESULT The network was evaluated on the dataset of 11 healthy subjects walking on a treadmill. The proposed decoding approach shows a robust reconstruction (AUC>90%) of gait patterns (i.e., swing and stance states) of both legs together, or of each leg independently.   SIGNIFICANCE Our results support for the first time the use of a memory-based deep learning classifier to decode walking activity from non-invasive brain recordings. We suggest that this classifier, exploited in real time, can be a more effective input for devices restoring locomotion in impaired people.","",""

Generally, manual phase picking is a trustworthy and the optimum method to determine the phase-arrival time, however, its capacity is restricted by available resources and time. Moreover, noisy seismic data renders an additional critical challenge for fast and accurate phase picking. In this study, a deep learning-based model, EPick, is proposed which benefits both from U-shaped neural network (also called UNet) and attention mechanism, as a strong alternative for seismic event detection and phase picking. On one hand, the utilization of UNet structure enables addressing different levels of deep features. On the other hand, attention mechanism promotes the decoder in the UNet structure to focus on the efficient exploitation of the low-resolution features learned from the encoder part to achieve precise phase picking. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that EPick achieves better performance over the benchmark method, and show the model’s robustness when tested on a different seismic dataset.","",""

The NN in the control law learns the system dynamics in an online manner, while the NN residual reconstruction errors and the bounded disturbances are overcome by the error sign signal. Since both of the NN output and the error sign signal are included in the integral, the continuity of the control input is ensured. The controller structure and the NN weight update law are novel in contrast with the previous effort, and the semiglobal asymptotic tracking performance is still guaranteed by using the Lyapunov analysis.

Experimental results show that both methods improve robustness to white noise static and adversarial examples, and even increase accuracy, but have different behavior depending on the architecture and task, being more beneficial to use the one or the other.

In a BCI-aided epilepsy treatment system, therapic electrical stimulus is delivered in response to the prediction of upcoming seizure onsets, therefore timely and accurate seizure prediction algorithm plays an important role. However, unlike typical signatures such as slow or sharp waves in ictal periods, the signal patterns in preictal periods are usually subtle, and highly individual-dependent. How to extract effective and robust preictal features is still a challenging problem. Most recently, graph convolutional neural network (GCNN) has demonstrated the strength in the electroencephalogram (EEG) and intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) signal modeling, due to its advantages in describing complex relationships among different EEG/iEEG regions. However, current GCNN models are not suitable for seizure prediction. The effectiveness of GCNNs highly relies on prior graphs that describe the underlying relationships in EEG regions. However, due to the complex mechanism of seizure evolution, the underlying relationship in the preictal period can be diverse in different patients, making it almost impossible to build a proper prior graph in general. To deal with this problem, we propose a novel approach to automatically learn a patient-specific graph in a data-driven way, which is called the joint graph structure and representation learning network (JGRN). JGRN constructs a global-local graph convolutional neural network which jointly learns the graph structures and connection weights in a task-related learning process in iEEG signals, thus the learned graph and feature representations can be optimized toward the objective of seizure prediction. Experimental results show that our JGRN outperforms CNN and GCNN models remarkably, and the improvement is more obvious when preictal features are subtle.","",""

This is mainly due to the development of Gaussian mixture model-based systems and in particular to the use of i-vectors. These systems handle relatively well noise and channel mismatches and yield a low error rate when confronted with zero-effort impostors, i.e. impostors using their own voice but claiming to be someone else. However, speaker verification systems are vulnerable to more sophisticated attacks, called presentation or spoofing attacks. In that case, the impostors present a fake sample to the system, which can either be generated with a speech synthesis or voice conversion algorithm or can be a previous recording of the target speaker. One way to make speaker recognition systems robust to this type of attack is to integrate a presentation attack detection system. Current methods for speaker recognition and presentation attack detection are largely based on short-term spectral processing. This has certain limitations. For instance, state-of-the-art speaker verification systems use cepstral features, which mainly capture vocal tract system characteristics, although voice source characteristics are also speaker discriminative. In the case of presentation attack detection, there is little prior knowledge that can guide us to differentiate bona fide samples from presentation attacks, as they are both speech signals that carry the same high level information, such as message, speaker identity and information about environment. This thesis focuses on developing speaker verification and presentation attack detection systems that rely on minimal assumptions. Towards that, inspired by recent advances in deep learning, we first develop speaker verification approaches where speaker discriminative information is learned from raw waveforms using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We show that such approaches are capable of learning both voice source related and vocal tract system related speaker discriminative information and yield performance competitive to state of the art systems, namely i-vectors and x-vectors-based systems. We then develop two high performing approaches for presentation attack detection: one based on long-term spectral statistics and the other based on raw speech modeling using CNNs. We show that these two approaches are complementary and make the speaker verification systems robust to presentation attacks. Finally, we develop a visualization method inspired from the computer vision community to gain insight about the task-specific information captured by the CNNs from the raw speech signals.","",""

The characteristics of existing one-class labels lead to a dilemma: it is hard to directly use a multiple classifier based on deep neural networks to solve one-class classification problems. Therefore, in this article, we propose a novel DeepOC neural network, termed as DeepOC, which can simultaneously learn compact feature representations and train a DeepOC classifier. Only with the given normal samples, we use the stacked convolutional encoder to generate their low-dimensional high-level features and train a one-class classifier to make these features as compact as possible. Meanwhile, for the sake of the correct mapping relation and the feature representations’ diversity, we utilize a decoder in order to reconstruct raw samples from these low-dimensional feature representations. This structure is gradually established using an adversarial mechanism during the training stage. This mechanism is the key to our model. It organically combines two seemingly contradictory components and allows them to take advantage of each other, thus making the model robust and effective. Unlike methods that use handcrafted features or those that are separated into two stages (extracting features and training classifiers), DeepOC is a one-stage model using reliable features that are automatically extracted by neural networks. Experiments on various benchmark data sets show that DeepOC is feasible and achieves the state-of-the-art anomaly detection results compared with a dozen existing methods.","",""

However, various working requirements and the oceanic environment may cause some uncertain and unfavorable factors for ship-mounted crane control. In particular, to accomplish different control tasks, some plant parameters (e.g., boom lengths, payload masses, and so on) frequently change; hence, most existing model-based controllers cannot ensure satisfactory control performance any longer. For example, inaccurate gravity compensation may result in positioning errors. Additionally, due to ship roll motions caused by sea waves, residual payload swing generally exists, which may result in safety risks in practice. To solve the above-mentioned issues, this paper designs a neural network-based adaptive control method that can provide effective control for both actuated and unactuated state variables based on the original nonlinear ship-mounted crane dynamics without any linearizing operations. In particular, the proposed update law availably compensates parameter/structure uncertainties for ship-mounted crane systems. Based on a 2-D sliding surface, the boom and rope can arrive at their preset positions in finite time, and the payload swing can be completely suppressed. Furthermore, the problem of nonlinear input dead zones is also taken into account. The stability of the equilibrium point of all state variables in ship-mounted crane systems is theoretically proven by a rigorous Lyapunov-based analysis. The hardware experimental results verify the practicability and robustness of the presented control approach.","",""

The first example tested the DNN working as an identifier into a mathematical model describing the dynamics of a spatial minisatellite. The second example (with a DNN implemented as an observer) tested the methodology of this paper over a single link flexible robot manipulator represented in a canonical (Brunovsky) form. In both examples, the mathematical models served as data generators in the testing of the neural networks. Even when not exact mathematical description of both models was used in the input estimation, the accuracy obtained with the DNN is comparable with the case of applying a high-order differentiator with complete knowledge of the plant.","",""

For example, existing works demonstrate that attackers can fool the GNNs to give the outcome they desire with unnoticeable perturbation on training graph.

Recent work in adversarial training, a form of robust optimization in which the model is optimized against adversarial examples, demonstrates the ability to improve performance sensitivities to perturbations and yield feature representations that are more interpretable. Adversarial training, however, comes with an increased computational cost over that of standard (i.e., nonrobust) training, rendering it impractical for use in large-scale problems. Recent work suggests that a fast approximation to adversarial training shows promise for reducing training time and maintaining robustness in the presence of perturbations bounded by the infinity norm. In this work, we demonstrate that this approach extends to the Euclidean norm and preserves the human-aligned feature representations that are common for robust models. Additionally, we show that using a distributed training scheme can further reduce the time to train robust deep networks. Fast adversarial training is a promising approach that will provide increased security and explainability in machine learning applications for which robust optimization was previously thought to be impractical.","",""

Furthermore, for steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) BCI systems, multiple states (sub-states) exist within the IC state. Existing recognition methods rely on a threshold technique, which is difficult to realize high accuracy, i.e., simultaneously high true positive rate and low false positive rate. To address this issue, we proposed a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect IC and NC states in a SSVEP-BCI system for the first time. Specifically, the steady-state motion visual evoked potentials (SSMVEP) paradigm, which has been shown to induce less visual discomfort, was chosen as the experimental paradigm. Two processing pipelines were proposed for the detection of IC and NC states. The first one was using CNN as a multi-class classifier to discriminate between all the states in IC and NC state (FFT-CNN). The second one was using CNN to discriminate between IC and NC states, and using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to perform classification tasks within the IC (FFT-CNN-CCA). We demonstrated that both pipelines achieved a significant increase in accuracy for low-performance healthy participants when traditional algorithms such as CCA threshold were used. Furthermore, the FFT-CNN-CCA pipeline achieved better performance than the FFT-CNN pipeline based on the stroke patients’ data. In summary, we showed that CNN can be used for robust detection in an asynchronous SSMVEP-BCI with great potential for out-of-lab BCI applications.","",""

To match two key points, two image patches centered at the key points are entered into the proposed network. The network aims to learn discriminative feature representations for patch matching, so that more matching pairs can be obtained on the premise of maintaining higher subpixel matching accuracy. The proposed network adopts a two-stage training mode to deal with the complex characteristics of RS images. An adaptive sample selection strategy is proposed to determine the size of each patch by the scale of its central key point. Thus, each patch can preserve the texture structure around its key point rather than all patches have a predetermined size.

While these methods get excellent performance when tested under conditions similar to those considered for training, they often suffer from a lack of robustness and generalization ability, as they fail to detect fake images that are generated by “unseen” GAN models.

It is known that the disadvantages of robust control for the NARMA model are as follows: 1) suitable control parameters for larger time delay are more sensitive to achieving desirable performance; 2) it only deals with bounded uncertainty; and 3) the nominal NARMA model must be learned in advance. Due to the dynamic feature of the NARMA model, a recurrent neural network (RNN) is online applied to learn it. However, the system performance becomes deteriorated due to the poor learning of the larger variation of system vector functions. In this situation, a simple network is employed to compensate the upper bound of the residue caused by the linear parameterization of the approximation error of RNN. An e-modification learning law with a projection for weight matrix is applied to guarantee its boundedness without persistent excitation.

Endoscopy is an essential examination for a timely and accurate diagnosis but the results can be confusing and rely heavily on the experience of the clinician.      OBJECTIVE  We aim to perform more accurate endoscopic diagnosis between CD and ITB by building a trustworthy AI differential diagnosis application with high interpretability.      METHODS  A total of 1271 electronic health record (EHR) patients who had undergone colonoscopies at Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH) and were clinically diagnosed with CD (n=875) or ITB (n=396) were used in this study. We build a workflow to make diagnoses with EHRs and mine differential diagnosis features; this involves finetuning the pretrained language models, distilling them into a light and efficient TextCNN model, interpreting the neural network and selecting differential attribution features, and then adopting manual feature checking and carrying out debias training.      RESULTS  The accuracy of debiased TextCNN on differential diagnosis between CD and ITB is 0.83 (CR F1: 0.87, ITB F1: 0.77), which is the best among the baselines. On the noisy validation set, its accuracy was 0.70 (CR F1: 0.87, ITB: 0.69), which was significantly higher than that of models without debias. We also interpret all of the models and find that the debiased model more easily mines the diagnostically significant features. The debiased TextCNN unearthed 39 diagnostic features in the form of phrases, 17 of which were key diagnostic features recognized by the guidelines.      CONCLUSIONS  We build a trustworthy AI differential diagnosis application for differentiating between CD and ITB focusing on accuracy, interpretability and robustness. The classifiers perform well, and the features that were found to have statistical significance are in agreement with clinical guidelines. ","",""

The recognition of these patterns is made difficult by their substantial variation in cadence and duration. The neural circuit behaviors used are similar to those associated with brain neural integrators. In the larger context described here, this kind of circuit becomes a building block of an entirely different computational algorithm for solving complex problems. While the network behavior is simulated in detail, a collective view is essential to understanding the results. A closed equation of motion for the collective variable describes an algorithm that quantitatively accounts for many aspects of the emergent network computation. The feedback connections and ongoing activity in the network shape the collective dynamics onto a reduced dimensionality manifold of activity space, which defines the algorithm and computation actually performed. The external inputs are weak and are not the dominant drivers of network activity.","",""

Four design variables and two noise variables are included in the experiment, a full factorial design is adopted for the design matrix to estimate all main and two factor interaction effects, and the signal-to-noise (SN) ratio is used as a performance measure for achieving robustness. In the second experiment, only a fraction of the full factorial design is used as the design matrix and the results are compared with those from the full factorial experiment in terms of prediction accuracy.

We show the model is able to continuously learn a large number of variable order temporal sequences using an unsupervised Hebbian-like learning rule. The sparse temporal codes formed by the model can robustly handle branching temporal sequences by maintaining multiple predictions until there is sufficient disambiguating evidence. We compare the HTM sequence memory with other sequence learning algorithms, including statistical methods—autoregressive integrated moving average; feedforward neural networks—time delay neural network and online sequential extreme learning machine; and recurrent neural networks—long short-term memory and echo-state networks on sequence prediction problems with both artificial and real-world data. The HTM model achieves comparable accuracy to other state-of-the-art algorithms. The model also exhibits properties that are critical for sequence learning, including continuous online learning, the ability to handle multiple predictions and branching sequences with high-order statistics, robustness to sensor noise and fault tolerance, and good performance without task-specific hyperparameter tuning. Therefore, the HTM sequence memory not only advances our understanding of how the brain may solve the sequence learning problem but is also applicable to real-world sequence learning problems from continuous data streams.","",""

To fill this gap, we proposed a neural network that utilizes a specific spatiotemporal arrangement of asymmetric lateral inhibited direction selective neural networks (DSNNs) for rotational motion perception. The proposed neural network consists of two parts—presynaptic and postsynaptic parts. In the presynaptic part, there are a number of lateral inhibited DSNNs to extract directional visual cues. In the postsynaptic part, similar to the arrangement of the directional columns in the cerebral cortex, these direction selective neurons are arranged in a cyclic order to perceive rotational motion cues. In the postsynaptic network, the delayed excitation from each direction selective neuron is multiplied by the gathered excitation from this neuron and its unilateral counterparts depending on which rotation, clockwise (cw) or counter-cw (ccw), to perceive. Systematic experiments under various conditions and settings have been carried out and validated the robustness and reliability of the proposed neural network in detecting cw or ccw rotational motion.

The large amount of required manually labeled data as well as the lack of interpretability of the results however often limit the use of DL in medical scenarios. A possible way to tackle these obstacles is the utilization of Bayesian deep learning (BDL) methods. The modelling of uncertainties in the network parameters and the thereby possible quantification of predictive uncertainties allows both the identification of potential erroneous predictions as well as the targeted selection of informative signals in the context of active learning. To evaluate the applicability of BDL for the analysis of electrophysiological data as well as to increase the training efficiency by active learning, we implemented a multi-task Bayesian Convolutional Neural Network (BCNN) for the simultaneous classification of action potentials and the assessment of relevant signal characteristics (latency, maximum, minimum). We compare the results for electromyographical signals (EMG), containing in total approximately twelve thousand signals from 34 patients, with both a traditional non-Bayesian single-task and multi-task CNN. For all models, including the BCNN, we could achieve similar performances with detection rates over 97% accuracy. Further, we could improve training efficiency of the BCNN using pool-based active learning and therefore significantly reduce the required amount of manual labeling. The evaluated predictive uncertainties of the BCNN prove useful both for the efficient selection of informative signals in the context of active learning as well as the interpretation of the predictive posterior distribution and therefore trustworthiness of the classifications.","",""

Our structure is able to process real-valued and multidimensional sequences. This capability is attained by addressing three critical problems in sequential learning, namely the error tolerance, the significance of sequence elements and memory forgetting. We demonstrate the potential of the framework with a series of synthetic simulations and the Australian sign language (ASL) dataset. Results show that our LTM model is robust to different types of distortions. Second, our LTM model outperforms other sequential processing models in a classification task for the ASL dataset.","",""

In this paper, the nonparametric neural network-based prediction intervals (PIs) are implemented for forecast uncertainty quantification. Instead of a single level PI, wind power forecast uncertainties are represented in a list of PIs. These PIs are then decomposed into quantiles of wind power. A new scenario generation method is proposed to handle wind power forecast uncertainties. For each hour, an empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) is fitted to these quantile points. The Monte Carlo simulation method is used to generate scenarios from the ECDF. Then the wind power scenarios are incorporated into a stochastic security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) model. The heuristic genetic algorithm is utilized to solve the stochastic SCUC problem. Five deterministic and four stochastic case studies incorporated with interval forecasts of wind power are implemented. The results of these cases are presented and discussed together. Generation costs, and the scheduled and real-time economic dispatch reserves of different unit commitment strategies are compared. The experimental results show that the stochastic model is more robust than deterministic ones and, thus, decreases the risk in system operations of smart grids.","",""

The proposed controller consists of high-gain feedback, Nussbaum gain matrix selector, online approximator (OLA) model and a robust term. The OLA model is represented by a two-layer neural network. The continuousness of the control signal is guaranteed to relax the requirement for the actuator bandwidth and avoid the incurred chattering effect. Asymptotic tracking performance is achieved theoretically by standard Lyapunov analysis. The control feasibility is also verified in simulation environment.","",""

Most of these methods are based on minimizing an upper bound on the worst-case loss over all possible adversarial perturbations. While these techniques show promise, they often result in difficult optimization procedures that remain hard to scale to larger networks. Through a comprehensive analysis, we show how a simple bounding technique, interval bound propagation (IBP), can be exploited to train large provably robust neural networks that beat the state-of-the-art in verified accuracy. While the upper bound computed by IBP can be quite weak for general networks, we demonstrate that an appropriate loss and clever hyper-parameter schedule allow the network to adapt such that the IBP bound is tight. This results in a fast and stable learning algorithm that outperforms more sophisticated methods and achieves state-of-the-art results on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and SVHN. It also allows us to train the largest model to be verified beyond vacuous bounds on a downscaled version of ImageNet.","",""
