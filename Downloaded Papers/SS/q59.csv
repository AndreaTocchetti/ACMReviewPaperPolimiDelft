To improve the robustness of CNN in open-set recognition (OSR) and meanwhile maintain its high accuracy in CSR, we propose an alternative deep framework called convolutional prototype network (CPN), which keeps CNN for representation learning but replaces the closed-world assumed softmax with an open-world oriented and human-like prototype model. To equip CPN with discriminative ability for classifying known samples, we design several discriminative losses for training. Moreover, to increase the robustness of CPN for unknowns, we interpret CPN from the perspective of generative model and further propose a generative loss, which is essentially maximizing the log-likelihood of known samples and serves as a latent regularization for discriminative learning. The combination of discriminative and generative losses makes CPN a hybrid model with advantages for both CSR and OSR. Under the designed losses, the CPN is trained end-to-end for learning the convolutional network and prototypes jointly. For application of CPN in OSR, we propose two rejection rules for detecting different types of unknowns. Experiments on several datasets demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of CPN for both CSR and OSR tasks.","",""

Here, we present a neural network approach that autonomously discovers reaction pathways from the time-resolved species concentration data. The proposed chemical reaction neural network (CRNN), by design, satisfies the fundamental physics laws, including the law of mass action and the Arrhenius law. Consequently, the CRNN is physically interpretable such that the reaction pathways can be interpreted, and the kinetic parameters can be quantified simultaneously from the weights of the neural network. The inference of the chemical pathways is accomplished by training the CRNN with species concentration data via stochastic gradient descent. We demonstrate the successful implementations and the robustness of the approach in elucidating the chemical reaction pathways of several chemical engineering and biochemical systems. The autonomous inference by the CRNN approach precludes the need for expert knowledge in proposing candidate networks and addresses the curse of dimensionality in complex systems.

While training a neural network, the iterative optimization algorithm involved also creates an online learning problem, and consequently, correct estimation of the optimal parameters requires persistent excitation of the network weights. In this work, we analyze the dynamics of the gradient descent algorithm while training a two-layer neural network with two different loss functions, the squared-error loss and the cross-entropy loss; and we obtain conditions to guarantee persistent excitation of the network weights. We then show that these conditions are difficult to satisfy when a multi-layer network is trained for a classification task, for the signals in the intermediate layers of the network become low-dimensional during training and fail to remain persistently exciting.

Consequently, even though the neural network is known for its rich expressivity of nonlinear functions, directly using an NN to reconstruct the force-displacement relation for general deformable simulation is nearly impossible. NNWarp obviates this difficulty by partially restoring the force-displacement relation via warping the nodal displacement simulated using a simplistic constitutive model–the linear elasticity. In other words, NNWarp yields an incremental displacement fix per mesh node based on a simplified (therefore incorrect) simulation result other than synthesizing the unknown displacement directly.

NNWarp is robust under different model shapes and tessellations. With the assistance of deformation substructuring, one NN training is able to handle a wide range of 3D models of various geometries. Thanks to the linear elasticity and its constant system matrix, the underlying simulator only needs to perform one pre-factorized matrix solve at each time step, which allows NNWarp to simulate large models in real time.","",""

In this work, we take a ""virtual experimental"" approach to this problem. Simulating idealized neuroscience experiments with artificial neural networks, we generate a large-scale dataset of learning trajectories of aggregate statistics measured in a variety of neural network architectures, loss functions, learning rule hyperparameters, and parameter initializations. We then take a discriminative approach, training linear and simple non-linear classifiers to identify learning rules from features based on these observables. We show that different classes of learning rules can be separated solely on the basis of aggregate statistics of the weights, activations, or instantaneous layer-wise activity changes, and that these results generalize to limited access to the trajectory and held-out architectures and learning curricula. We identify the statistics of each observable that are most relevant for rule identification, finding that statistics from network activities across training are more robust to unit undersampling and measurement noise than those obtained from the synaptic strengths. Our results suggest that activation patterns, available from electrophysiological recordings of post-synaptic activities on the order of several hundred units, frequently measured at wider intervals over the course of learning, may provide a good basis on which to identify learning rules.","",""

In practice, these systems are often plagued by unknown interactions, which make the physics-based relations of the system dynamics only partially known. This article presents a neural network augmented physics (NNAP) model as a combination of physics-inspired and neural layers. The neural layers are inserted in the model to compensate for the unmodeled interactions, without requiring direct measurements of these unknown phenomena. In contrast to traditional approaches, both the neural network and physical parameters are simultaneously optimized, solely by using state and control input measurements. The methodology is applied on experimental data of a slider–crank setup, for which the state-dependent load interactions are unknown. The NNAP model proves to be a stable and accurate modeling formalism for dynamic systems that ab initio can only be partially described by physical laws. Moreover, the results show that a recurrent implementation of the NNAP model enables improved robustness and accuracy of the system state predictions, compared to its feedforward counterpart. Besides capturing the system dynamics, the NNAP model provides a means to gain new insights by extracting the neural network from the converged NNAP model. In this way, we discovered accurate representations of the unknown spring force interaction and friction phenomena acting on the slider mechanism.","",""

However, the nonlinear and time-varying control characteristics of the SynRM with high torque ripple confine the high-performance applications of this motor. Therefore, an intelligent backstepping control (BSC) using recurrent feature selection fuzzy neural network is proposed to construct a high-performance SynRM position servo drive system. First, the dynamic model of a vector control SynRM position servo drive is introduced. Second, a BSC system is designed for the tracking of the position reference. Since the lumped uncertainty of the SynRM position servo drive system is unavailable in advance, it is very difficult to design an effective BSC in practical applications. Moreover, the sign function in BSC will cause undesired chattering phenomenon, which will excite unknown dynamics and wear the ball bearing of the SynRM. To alleviate the existed difficulties in the BSC, the recurrent feature selection fuzzy neural network (RFSFNN) is proposed in this study to approximate an idea BSC. In addition, to compensate the possible approximated error of the RFSFNN, an improved adaptive compensator is augmented. The online learning algorithms of the RFSFNN are derived by using the Lyapunov stability method to assure asymptotical stability. Finally, the proposed control system is implemented in a 32-bit floating point digital signal processor.

Here, speech signals are used as input data and their noise is modeled as uncertainty. In this task, using speech spectrogram, a definition of uncertainty is proposed in neutrosophic (NS) domain. Uncertainty is computed for each Time-frequency point of speech spectrogram as like a pixel. Therefore, uncertainty matrix with the same size of spectrogram is created in NS domain.

In light of these dangers, numerous algorithms have been developed as defensive mechanisms from these adversarial inputs, some of which provide formal robustness guarantees or certificates. This work leverages research on certified adversarial robustness to develop an online certifiably robust for deep reinforcement learning algorithms. The proposed defense computes guaranteed lower bounds on state-action values during execution to identify and choose a robust action under a worst case deviation in input space due to possible adversaries or noise.

The implementations of anomaly-based IDSs on parallel processing platforms are considered as necessary to accelerate speed of the systems. Neural Networks are a good example of parallel computing. In this paper, we used Neural Network technology to classify normal or abnormal behaviors. The parallel nature of Neural Networks has been implemented on GPUs that allows the system to meet a set of requirements such as time constraints management, robustness, high processing speed and re-configurability. Experiments with KDD Cup 1999 network traffic connections which have been preprocessed with methods of features selection and normalization have shown that our work is effective to accelerate intrusion detection in anomaly-based IDS.

Sliding mode control (SMC) method has proved to be robust against parameter variation and unknown external disturbance with satisfactory tracking performance.

The adaptive radial basis function network (ARBFN) can effectively improve the control performance against large system uncertainty by learning to approximate arbitrary nonlinear functions and ensure the global asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system. In this paper, a novel vehicle dynamics stability control strategy is proposed using the adaptive radial basis function network sliding mode control (ARBFN-SMC) to learn system uncertainty and eliminate its adverse effects. This strategy adopts a hierarchical control structure which consists of reference model layer, yaw moment control layer, braking torque allocation layer and executive layer.

Then, the localization of sensor nodes has become an essential requirement for many applications over WSN. Meanwhile, the localization information of unknown nodes has strongly affected the performance of WSN. The received signal strength indication (RSSI) as a typical range-based algorithm for positioning sensor nodes in WSN could achieve accurate location with hardware saving, but is sensitive to environmental noises. Moreover, the original distance vector hop (DV-HOP) as an important range-free localization algorithm is simple, inexpensive and not related to the environment factors, but performs poorly when lacking anchor nodes. Motivated by these, various improved DV-HOP schemes with RSSI have been introduced, and we present a new neural network (NN)-based node localization scheme, named RHOP-ELM-RCC, through the use of DV-HOP, RSSI and a regularized correntropy criterion (RCC)-based extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm (ELM-RCC). Firstly, the proposed scheme employs both RSSI and DV-HOP to evaluate the distances between nodes to enhance the accuracy of distance estimation at a reasonable cost. Then, with the help of ELM featured with a fast learning speed with a good generalization performance and minimal human intervention, a single hidden layer feedforward network (SLFN) on the basis of ELM-RCC is used to implement the optimization task for obtaining the location of unknown nodes. Since the RSSI may be influenced by the environmental noises and may bring estimation error, the RCC instead of the mean square error (MSE) estimation, which is sensitive to noises, is exploited in ELM. Hence, it may make the estimation more robust against outliers. Additionally, the least square estimation (LSE) in ELM is replaced by the half-quadratic optimization technique.

The task of mapping cities by autonomous operators was usually carried out by aerial optical images due to its scale and resolution; however new scientific questions have arisen, and this has led research into a new era of highly-detailed data extraction. For many years, using artificial neural models to solve complex problems such as automatic image classification was commonplace, owing much of their popularity to their ability to adapt to complex situations without needing human intervention. In spite of that, their popularity declined in the mid-2000s, mostly due to the complex and time-consuming nature of their methods and workflows. However, newer neural network architectures have brought back the interest in their application for autonomous classifiers, especially for image classification purposes. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have been a trend for pixel-wise image segmentation, showing flexibility when detecting and classifying any kind of object, even in situations where humans failed to perceive differences, such as in city scenarios. In this paper, we aim to explore and experiment with state-of-the-art technologies to semantically label 3D urban models over complex scenarios. To achieve these goals, we split the problem into two main processing lines: first, how to correctly label the façade features in the 2D domain, where a supervised CNN is used to segment ground-based façade images into six feature classes, roof, window, wall, door, balcony and shop; second, a Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Multi-View-Stereo (MVS) workflow is used to extract the geometry of the façade, wherein the segmented images in the previous stage are then used to label the generated mesh by a “reverse” ray-tracing technique. This paper demonstrates that the proposed methodology is robust in complex scenarios. The façade feature inferences have reached up to 93% accuracy over most of the datasets used. Although it still presents some deficiencies in unknown architectural styles and needs some improvements to be made regarding 3D-labeling, we present a consistent and simple methodology to handle the problem.","",""

Tracking of surgical instruments by vision-based methods is quite lucrative, due to its flexible implementation via software-based control with no need to modify instruments or surgical workflow. Methods: A MIS instrument is conventionally split into a shaft and end-effector portions, while a 2D/3D tracking-by-detection framework is proposed, which performs the shaft tracking followed by the end-effector one. The former portion is described by line features via the RANSAC scheme, while the latter is depicted by special image features based on deep learning through a well-trained convolutional neural network. Results: The method verification in 2D and 3D formulation is performed through the experiments on ex-vivo video sequences, while qualitative validation on in-vivo video sequences is obtained. Conclusion: The proposed method provides robust and accurate tracking, which is confirmed by the experimental results: its 3D performance in ex-vivo video sequences exceeds those of the available state-of -the-art methods. Moreover, the experiments on in-vivo sequences demonstrate that the proposed method can tackle the difficult condition of tracking with unknown camera parameters.

A virtual leader–follower formation technique is used to design a controller in order to force a team of tractor–trailer systems to construct a desired formation configuration. Since tractor–trailer systems have a nonlinear multi-input multi-output model with strong couplings, multi-layer neural networks are employed to overcome unknown nonlinearities and uncertain parameters by using on-line weight tuning algorithms. Neural network approximation errors and external disturbances are also compensated with adaptive robust signals. The dynamic surface control approach has been used to reduce the complexity of the proposed controller effectively. Lyapunov’s direct method proves that all signals in the closed-loop formation control system are bounded and tracking errors converge to a neighborhood of the origin whose size is adjustable. Finally, simulation results will be provided to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed controller.","",""

What is neural network Neural network are simplified models of the biological nervous system and therefore have drawn their motivation from the kind of computing performed by a human brain. An NN in general is a highly interconnected of a large number of processing elements called neurons in an architecture inspired by the brain. An NN can be massively parallel and therefore is said to exhibit parallel distributed processing. Neural Network exhibits characteristics such as mapping capabilities or pattern association, generalization, robustness, fault tolerance, and parallel and high speed information processing. Neural network learn by example. They can therefore be trained with known examples of a problem to acquire knowledge about it. Once appropriate trained the network can be put to effective use in solving ‘unknown’ or ‘untrained’ instances of the problem. Neural network adopt various learning mechanism of which supervised learning and unsupervised learning methods have turned out to be very popular. In supervised learning, a teacher is assumed to be present during the learning process, i.e. the network aims to minimize he error between target (desired) output presented by the teacher and the computed output to achieve better performance. However, in unsupervised learning, there is no teacher present to hand over the desired output and the network therefore tries to learn by itself, organizing the input instances of the problem.NN Architecture has been broadly classified as single layer feed forward networks, multilayer feed forward networks and recurrent networks, over the year several other NN.Architecture have evolved .some of the well known NN system include backpropogation network, perceptron, ADALINE ,Boltzmann machine ,adaptive resonance theory, Self-organized feature map, and Hopfield network. Neural Network has been successfully applied to problem in the field of pattern recognition, image processing, data compression, forecasting and optimization to quote a few. International Journal of Computer Science & Engineering Survey (IJCSES) Vol.3, No.1, February 2012 128 Backpropagation algorithm The architecture of the neural network is the one of a basically backpropagation network with only one hidden layer (although it is the same techniques with more layers). The input layer is constituted of 35 neuron (one per input pixel in the matrix, of course)., they are 8 hidden neurons, and 26 output neurons(one per letter) in this problem domain of character recognition. The weight matrix gives the weight factor for each input of each neuron. These matrices are what we can call the memory of the neural network. The learning process is done by adjusting these weight so that for each given input the output is as near as possible of a wanted output (Here the full activation of the output neuron corresponding to the character to be recognized) [1]. The training patterns are applied in some random order one by one, and the weights are adjusted using the backpropagation learning law. Each application of the training set patterns is called a cycle. The patterns have to be applied for several training cycles to obtain the output error to an acceptable low value. Once the network is trained, it can be used to recall the appropriate pattern for a new input pattern. The computation for recall is straightforward, in the sense that the weights and the output functions of the units in different layers are used to compute the activation values and the output signals. The signals from the output layer correspond to the output[2]. Backpropagation learning emerged as the most significant result in the field of artificial neural networks. The backpropagation learning involves propagation of the error backwards from the output layer to the hidden layers in order to determine the update for the weights leading to the units in a hidden layer. The error at the output layer itself is computed using the difference between the desired output and the actual output at each of the output units. The actual output for a given input training pattern is determined by computing the outputs of units for each hidden layer in the forward pass of the input data. The error in the output is propagated backwards only to determine the weight updates [6].","",""

However, the spectrum often suffers from band overlap and random noise due to the distortion caused by the point spread function, especially for aging instruments. The problem of reconstructing the clear spectrum from the degraded spectrum is called spectrum deconvolution. Traditional partial differential equation (PDE) methods rely on distribution assumptions in the reconstructed process. This restriction makes PDE methods sensitive to tackle complex instrumental broadening effect in the dispersive IR spectrometers. Also, we need to spend much time setting the parameters of PDE models manually. These problems intuitively degrade the performances of PDE methods. In this article, we propose an end-to-end neural network framework for spectral deconvolution problem. The novelty of this article lies in its strong robustness from dilated deconvolution and self-paced learning procedure to challenge the complicated degraded spectra. Actually, the deconvolution problem is tailored to a dense prediction problem in this article. Inspired by the extensive use and excellent effects of dilated convolutions in dense prediction, a lightweight dilated convolution module is given to detect the overlaps of degraded spectra. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed solution has an outstanding performance against many other approaches.

In this approach, complex (and novel) behaviors can be acquired by embedding multiple modules (motor primitives) in a single, multi-purpose neural network. This is supported by recent theories of brain functioning in which skilled behaviors can be generated by combining functional different primitives embedded in “reusable” areas of “recycled” neurons. Such neuronal substrate supports flexible cognitive control, too. Modules are seen as interpreters of behaviors having controlling input parameters, or programs that encode structures of networks to be interpreted. Flexible cognitive control can be exerted by a programmer module feeding the interpreters with appropriate input parameters, without modifying connectivity.

First, a neural network based fault estimation is designed to online approximate the unknown uncertainties and faults. The estimated uncertainty and fault information are then used to compensate in advance for the effects of uncertainties in fault-free operation and both uncertainties and faults in fault operation. To eliminate the neural network compensation error, QC2S with adaptation gain, named as adaptive QC2S (AQC2S), is proposed. By integrating the advantages of the neural network observer and the AQC2S controller, the integrated scheme has a good capability to accommodate both the uncertainties and faults with chattering-free, higher position tracking accuracy, and no requirement of prior knowledge of the fault information.

To this end, we perform the first security analysis of state-of-the-art defenses and design adaptive attacks on them. Our 100% adaptive attack success rates demonstrate that current defense designs are still vulnerable. Since adversarial training (AT) is believed to be the most effective defense, we present the first in-depth study showing how AT behaves in point cloud classification and identify that the required symmetric function (pooling operation) is paramount to the model's robustness under AT. Through our systematic analysis, we find that the default used fixed pooling operations (e.g., MAX pooling) generally weaken AT's performance in point cloud classification. Still, sorting-based parametric pooling operations can significantly improve the models' robustness. Based on the above insights, we further propose DeepSym, a deep symmetric pooling operation, to architecturally advance the adversarial robustness under AT to 47.0% without sacrificing nominal accuracy, outperforming the original design and a strong baseline by 28.5% ($\sim 2.6 \times$) and 6.5%, respectively, in PointNet.","",""

In addition, the effects of disturbances and uncertainties need to be removed, and the response rates are increased. Therefore, the integral full-order terminal sliding mode (IFOTSM) surface was proposed. To track the specified trajectories with high accuracy, a control approach is developed for the class of general nonlinear second-order systems by utilizing an IFOTSM surface and an adaptive compensator. The unknown dynamic model is derived based on a radial basis function neural network (RBFNN). Consequently, our controller provides good performance with minimum position errors, robustness against uncertainties, and work without a precise dynamic model.

Dynamic neural networks, as a class of modeling approaches, have been intensively explored in recent decades for solving linear equations. The time-varying nature of this problem and the noisy workspace for many engineering practice require two features of practical design: 1) fast convergence in time and 2) robustness against noises and disturbance. Existing solutions usually decouple the problem into two steps by designing a fast-convergent neural controller and then topped with an additional low-pass filter to reach noise robustness. However, due to the interplay of the mentioned two dynamical parts, the overall system may lose stability if the parameters are not well tuned. In this paper, we establish the first dynamical neural model for simultaneously achieving fast-convergence, particularly finite-time convergence, and noise-robustness, with the capability to reject the unknown noise when it is constant or varies slowly. To do so, a superior design formula activated by noise-tolerant nonlinear functions is proposed to enhance the capability of zeroing neural networks (ZNNs), achieving denoising and finite-time convergence in a unified design. According to this design formula, a novel recurrent neural network (RNN) with finite-time convergence and inherently noise-suppression performance [thus termed the finite-time robust RNN (FTRRNN)] is developed and applied to robotic motion tracking illustrated via time-varying linear equation system solving. Furthermore, theoretical analyses on the global stability, the finite-time convergence and the denoising ability of the proposed design formula and the corresponding FTRRNN model are presented in details. The upper bound on the convergence time is also analytically derived. A numerical example is supplied to verify the superior property of the FTRRNN model to the ZNN model according to the results of computing time-varying linear equation system in the presence of additive noises. Finally, an application to robotic motion tracking is presented to show that the presented FTRRNN model can successfully realize the ellipse-path tracking control of a planar two-link manipulator in front of the external disturbances, while the conventional ZNN model fails under the same conditions.","",""

We consider a setup where robustness is expected over an unseen test domain that is not i.i.d. but deviates from the training domain. While this deviation may not be exactly known, its broad characterization is specified a priori, in terms of attributes. We propose an adversarial training approach which learns to generate new samples so as to maximize exposure of the classifier to the attributes-space, without having access to the data from the test domain. Our adversarial training solves a min-max optimization problem, with the inner maximization generating adversarial perturbations, and the outer minimization finding model parameters by optimizing the loss on adversarial perturbations generated from the inner maximization. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach on three types of naturally occurring perturbations -- object-related shifts, geometric transformations, and common image corruptions. Our approach enables deep neural networks to be robust against a wide range of naturally occurring perturbations. We demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed approach by showing the robustness gains of deep neural networks trained using our adversarial training on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and a new variant of the CLEVR dataset.","",""

The unknown nonlinear model can be approximately learning by RBF neural network (RBFNN) system. With the aid of robust items, the external disturbance problem and the approximation errors are solved. It is proved that the proposed adaptive control scheme can guarantee the PMSM rotor dynamic system stability based on Lyapunov analysis. Simulation studies show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Also, the results in this paper could serve as a basis for the future research and experiment.","",""

Existing methods heavily rely on the expert-designed networks, which may lead to a sub-optimal solution for FAS task. Here we propose the first FAS method based on neural architecture search (NAS), called NAS-FAS, to discover the well-suited task-aware networks. Unlike previous NAS works mainly focus on developing efficient search strategies in generic object classification, we pay more attention to study the search spaces for FAS task. The challenges of utilizing NAS for FAS are in two folds: the networks searched on 1) a specific acquisition condition might perform poorly in unseen conditions, and 2) particular spoofing attacks might generalize badly for unseen attacks. To overcome these two issues, we develop a novel search space consisting of central difference convolution and pooling operators. Moreover, an efficient static-dynamic representation is exploited for fully mining the FAS-aware spatio-temporal discrepancy. Besides, we propose Domain/Type-aware Meta-NAS, which leverages cross-domain/type knowledge for robust searching. Finally, in order to evaluate the NAS transferability for cross datasets and unknown attack types, we release a large-scale 3D mask dataset, namely CASIA-SURF 3DMask, for supporting the new ‘cross-dataset cross-type’ testing protocol. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed NAS-FAS achieves state-of-the-art performance on nine FAS benchmark datasets with four testing protocols.","",""

It permits the detection of unknown obstacle to avoid collisions by simultaneously a steering the mobile robot toward the target; a regular grid map representation for a work space environment is caurried out. A Neural Network (NN) model is used to learn many critical situations of environment during robot navigation among obstacles using MVFH. Also, digital filter has been utilized for improving the robustness of obstacle avoidance trajectory of mobile robot. The proposed MVFH-NN has been implemented and tested by using MobotSim program simulation and MATLAB . The developed algorithm showed good navigation properties and can be used in complex real world (maze-like environment), it also shows good ability to overcome limitations of the traditional VFH algorithm (like wide candidate valley, narrow hallway and target distance limitation).","",""
