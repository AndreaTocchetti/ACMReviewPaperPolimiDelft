Neural network models have become the leading solution for a large variety of tasks, such as classiﬁcation, natural language process-ing, and others. However, their reliability is heavily plagued by adversarial inputs : inputs generated by adding tiny perturbations to correctly-classiﬁed inputs, and for which the neural network produces erroneous results. In this paper, we present a new method called Robustness Measurement and Assessment ( RoMA ), which measures the robustness of a neural network model against such adversarial inputs. Speciﬁcally, RoMA determines the probability that a random input perturbation might cause misclassiﬁcation. The method allows us to provide formal guarantees regarding the expected frequency of errors that a trained model will encounter after deployment. The type of robustness assessment aﬀorded by RoMA is inspired by state-of-the-art certiﬁcation practices, and could constitute an important step toward integrating neural networks in safety-critical systems.","",""

In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes a probabilistic neural network (PNN)-based fault diagnosis model for power transformers and optimizes the smoothing factor of the pattern layer of PNN by the improved gray wolf optimizer (IGWO) to improve the classification accuracy and robustness of PNN. The standard GWO easily falls into the local optimum because the update mechanism is too single. The update strategy proposed in this paper enhances the convergence ability and exploration ability of the algorithm, which greatly alleviates the dilemma that GWO is prone to fall into local optimum when dealing with complex data. In this paper, a reliability analysis of thirteen diagnostic methods is conducted using 555 transformer fault samples collected from Jiangxi Power Supply Company, China. The results show that the diagnostic accuracy of the IGWO-PNN model reaches 99.71%, which is much higher than that of the traditional IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission) three-ratio method.

To enhance learning ability of neural network models, the autoencoder method is used as a powerful tool to achieve deep learning and has gained success in recent years. However, the performance of existing autoencoder approaches for manipulator control may be still largely dependent on the quality of data, and for extreme cases with noisy data it may even fail. How to incorporate the model knowledge into the autoencoder controller design with an aim to increase the robustness and reliability remains a challenging problem. In this work, a sparse autoencoder controller for kinematic control of manipulators with weights obtained directly from the robot model rather than training data is proposed for the first time. By encoding and decoding the control target though a new dynamic recurrent neural network architecture, the control input can be solved through a new sparse optimization formulation. In this work, input saturation, which holds for almost all practical systems but usually is ignored for analysis simplicity, is also considered in the controller construction. Theoretical analysis and extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed sparse autoencoder controller with input saturation can make the end-effector of the manipulator system track the desired path efficiently. Further performance comparison and evaluation against the additive noise and parameter uncertainty substantiate robustness of the proposed sparse autoencoder manipulator controller.","",""

Often, ANNs with selected architecture are trained with the back-propagation algorithm from few data representatives of the input/output relationship of the underlying model of interest. However, different performing ANNs might be obtained from the same training data, leading to an uncertainty in selecting the best performing ANN. On the other hand, using cross-validation to select the best performing ANN based on the highest R2 value can lead to a biassing in terms of the prediction made by the selected ANN. This is due to the fact that the use of R2 cannot determine if the prediction made by ANN is biased. Additionally, R2 does not indicate if a model is adequate, as it is possible to have a low R2 for a good model and a high R2 for a bad model.

Multichannel seismograms were represented with a time-frequency domain in the form of multilayer images, with each signal channel forming one image layer. Images were then exposed to CNN (composed of three convolutional blocks whose architecture design was justified using Bayesian optimization). To improve reliability, we evaluated the posterior type function (PTP) as a combination of the probabilities of all of the considered classes of signal types (five in our case) which increased robustness of the identification. For data, we used records of acoustic emission (AE) events. The events were generated during laboratory loading experiments originally performed to study material/rock properties. As known, AE events may be studied in the same manner as natural earthquakes and treated in other ways as laboratory earthquake models. AE events are less complex compared to natural earthquakes where many of the physical parameters are known or may be controlled.

The aim of this paper is to improve the quality of the synthesized video by increasing the robustness against channel errors in fixed transmission rate. In other words, the robustness of the transmitted video frames increases without any increment in bit rate. This results in improvement in the quality of the synthesized video. In the proposed method, the transmitted information is considerably compressed using neural network with Huffman coding in H. 264.

This paper presents an ARTMAP-Fuzzy artificial neural network for monitoring and fault diagnosis in mechanical structures.

In order to validate the methodology we propose the modeling and simulation of signals from a numerical model using an aluminum beam. The results show the efficiency, robustness and accuracy of the methodology adopted. 1. Introduction Increasingly preventive maintenance has been used in industries, businesses, buildings, machinery monitoring, among others. Its use is justified by the need to reduce costs and increase reliability and safety of structures and equipment, preventing disasters from structural failures [5]. Structural failure can occur due to several factors, such as wear of a component, loosening of bolted joints, cracks or even the combination of these elements. Regardless of the origin and intensity, in most cases, structural failure causes an appreciable variation in the spatial parameters of structure, such as reduction in structural rigidity, slight reduction in mass and an increase in damping, which leads to a change of the dynamic behavior structure. Thus the spatial variation of the parameters affects the main dynamic parameters, response functions, resonance frequencies, damping ratio and eigenmodes of the structure [10]. There are some preventive maintenance techniques based on non-destructive testing (NDT) that are applied in oil analysis, magnetic particle, liquid penetrant, methods based on vibration analysis, etc.","",""

An uncertainty-aware model has the potential to self-evaluate the quality of its inference, thereby making it more reliable. Moreover, uncertainty-based rejection has been shown to improve the performance of sEMG-based hand gesture recognition. Therefore, we first define model reliability here as the quality of its uncertainty estimation and propose an offline framework to quantify it.

The proposed scheme is able to learn the weighted samples and update the weights iteratively in a self-paced manner to identify the reliable training samples. In the phase of updating weights, a grouping strategy is designed to avoid selecting training samples from homogeneous regions. Furthermore, a novel time-varying self-paced regularizer is proposed to automatically determine the learning scheme of self-paced learning. Finally, three classifiers, including SoftMax, backpropagation neural network, and support vector machine, are investigated under this proposed framework.

Observer design technique was applied to detect leaks in a gas pipeline using a regresso-classification hierarchical model where an intelligent model acts as a regressor and a leak detection algorithm acts as a classifier. Five intelligent models (Gradient Boosting, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and Artificial Neural Network) were used in this present work.

Indeed, it is hard to provide efficient approaches that are able to handle with the inherent uncertainty of prognostics and nobody is able to a priori ensure that an accurate prognostic model can be built. As for an example of remaining problems, consider data-driven prognostics approaches: how to ensure that a model will be able to face with inputs variation with respect to those ones that have been learned, how to ensure that a learned-model will face with unknown data, how to ensure convergence of algorithms, etc. In other words, robustness, reliability and applicability of a prognostic approach are still open areas. Following that, the aim of this paper is to address these challenges by proposing a new neural network (structure and algorithm) that enhances reliability of RUL estimates while improving applicability of the approach. Robustness, reliability and applicability aspects are first discussed and defined according to literature. On this basis, a new connexionist system is proposed for prognostics: the Improved-Extreme Learning machine (Imp-ELM). This neural network, based on complex activation functions, enables to reduce the influence of human choices and initial parameterization, while improving accuracy of estimates and speeding the learning phase. The whole proposition is illustrated by performing tests on a real industrial case of cutting tools from a Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machine.

The recent advances in areas of microprocessors and power electronics, along with the new control strategies based on artificial intelligence has led induction motors to be controlled more efficiently and reliably. Complex calculations such as coordinate transformations, field estimation algorithms and control algorithms used in the motor control can be easily done with digital signal processors which are powerful microcontrollers.

These CI methods are based only on a small set of data, which must represent the entire power system information. Therefore, feature selection is necessary.  Within this thesis, three methods for effective feature selection were developed. These selection methods apply the k-means cluster algorithm, the principal component analysis, decision trees, and genetic algorithms.  Changes in the network topology, the load situation, the operating point, and the influence of bad and missing data affect the quality and reliability of the proposed methods for OSA. The issues of robustness are discussed and methods for both bad data detection and restoration are developed. The bad data detection methods use similarity analysis, the principal component residuals, and time series analysis. The data restoration involves a neural network and non-linear sequential quadratic optimization.

The DP‐RTF refers to the ratio between the direct‐ path acoustic transfer functions of the two microphone channels. First, the complex‐value DP‐RTF is decomposed into the inter‐channel intensity difference, and sinusoidal functions of the inter‐channel phase difference in the time‐frequency domain. Then, the decomposed DP‐RTF features from a series of temporal context frames are utilized to train a DNN model, which maps the DP‐RTF features contaminated by noise and reverberation to the clean ones, and meanwhile provides a time‐frequency (TF) weight to indicate the reliability of the mapping. The DP‐RTF enhancement network can help to enhance the DP‐RTF against noise and reverberation. Finally, the DOA of a sound source can be estimated by integrating the weighted matching between the enhanced DP‐RTF features and the DP‐RTF templates. Experimental results on simulated data show the superiority of the proposed DP‐RTF enhancement network for estimating the DOA of the sound source in the environments with various levels of noise and reverberation.","",""

Since the first-stage input covers the whole image, the global facial information can be effectively used to weaken or even avoid the detection errors caused by occlusion, large posture changes, extreme illumination and etc. During facial detection, the first-stage network will make initial prediction of facial landmarks, and then get the facial area narrowed down and accurate according to the prediction results; the second-stage network will take the narrowed-down facial area above as the input, the three parallel convolution networks are used to classify the facial landmarks for quadratic estimates, so as to improve the accuracy of prediction results based on the results of first-stage network. The input of the third-stage network is limited to the small neighborhood of the second-stage prediction results, which can make the prediction results more accurate. The experimental data shows that our method has certain advantages in detection accuracy and reliability.","",""
