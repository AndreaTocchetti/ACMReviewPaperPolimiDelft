The current work aims to understand two basic questions regarding the deep neural network (DNN) method: what data the DNN needs and how general the DNN method can be. Sampling and preprocessing determine the DNN training dataset, further affect DNN prediction ability. The current work proposes using Box-Cox transformation (BCT) to preprocess the combustion data.

Our results reveal that the DNN trained by the manifold data can capture the chemical kinetics in limited configurations but cannot remain robust toward perturbation, which is inevitable for the DNN coupled with the flow field. The Monte Carlo and cycle-GAN samplings can cover a wider phase space but fail to capture small-scale intermediate species, producing poor prediction results. A three-hidden-layer DNN, based on the multi-scale method without specific flame simulation data, allows predicting chemical kinetics in various scenarios and being stable during the temporal evolutions. This single DNN is readily implemented with several CFD codes and validated in various combustors, including (1). zero-dimensional autoignition, (2). one-dimensional freely propagating flame, (3). two-dimensional jet flame with triple-flame structure, and (4). three-dimensional turbulent lifted flames. The ignition delay time, laminar flame speed, lifted flame height, and contours of physical quantities demonstrate the satisfying accuracy and generalization ability of the pre-trained DNN. The Fortran and Python versions of DNN and example code are attached in the supplementary for reproducibility.","",""

In this study, we show that recent AL methods offer a gain over random baseline under a brittle combination of experimental conditions. We demonstrate that such marginal gains vanish when experimental factors are changed, leading to reproducibility issues and suggesting that AL methods lack robustness. We also observe that with a properly tuned model, which employs recently proposed regularization techniques, the performance significantly improves for all AL methods including the random sampling baseline, and performance differences among the AL methods become negligible.

One of salient feature of the reservoir network is reproducibility or consistency of its responses to the same or similar inputs. This is usually guaranteed through the echo state property of the network by properly choosing synaptic weights among reservoir neurons. Another important feature is a variety of dynamics in the reservoir, which makes the reservoir to process complex time-varying input signals. One way to increase the variety of dynamics is introducing chaotic behavior by destabilize the reservoir network by changing weight values. However, this will violate the echo state property, therefore, chaotic dynamics are usually avoided in the reservoir computing.In this paper, we propose a method to introduce high-dimensional chaotic dynamics into the reservoir network, but keeping its consistency. To achieve this, we use a chaotic neural network model in the reservoir network, while keeping the weight matrix in the reservoir network to satisfy the echo state property criteria. In order to show the consistency of the chaotic neural network reservoir, preliminary results for chaotic time-series predictions through the chaotic neural network reservoir are illustrated. In addition, we discuss the application of the chaotic neural network reservoir to a self-aware hardware system.","",""

Yet, neural networks are susceptible to adversarial examples, carefully perturbed inputs that cause networks to misbehave in arbitrarily chosen ways[11]. An adversarial example is a sample of input data which has been modified very slightly in a way that is intended to cause a machine learning classifier to misclassify it. In many cases, these modifications can be so subtle that a human observer does not even notice the modification at all, yet the classifier still makes a mistake. Adversarial examples pose security concerns because they could be used to perform an attack on machine learning systems, even if the adversary has no access to the underlying model[? ]. Adversarial examples generated using standard techniques like Fast Gradient sign method[3] require complete control over the direct input to the neural network, this is not the case in real world scenarios.[4] For example, standard adversarial examples are not robust under rotation, cropping and various image transformation methods.

In this study, in order to form desired attractors through training of bidirectional autoassociative networks, a novel training algorithm is proposed which is based on gradient descent method and back-propagation algorithm. The proposed algorithm implicitly constrains the equilibrium points which form near the training samples to be attractors rather than repellers. Empirical results of a face reconstruction task corroborate that our training algorithm (99.0%) outperforms the conventional gradient descent-based algorithm (58.6%) in terms of attractor formation.

The magnitude of decline in this activation after SD was preserved in bilateral parietal regions. Among several behavioural metrics investigated, the most robust marker of vulnerability to SD was the change in the intra-individual variability of reaction times. This was shown to be both stable over time and correlated with the drop in left parietal activation from RW to SD in both experimental sessions.

Thus, ML-based models such as DNNs establish genuine business value and intellectual property (IP) for their owners. Therefore the trained models need to be protected from any adversary attacks such as illegal redistribution, reproducing, and derivation. Watermarking can be considered as an effective technique for securing a DNN model. However, so far, most of the watermarking algorithms focus on watermarking the DNN by adding noise to an image. To this end, we propose a framework for watermarking a DNN model designed for textual domain. The watermark generation scheme provides a secure watermarking method by combining Term Frequency (TF) and Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) of a particular word. The proposed embedding procedure takes place in the model's training stage, which makes the watermark verification stage straightforward by sending the watermarked document to the trained model. The experimental results show that watermarked models have the same accuracy as the original one, and the proposed framework accurately verifies the ownership of all surrogate models without impairing the performance. The proposed algorithm is robust against well-known attacks such as parameter pruning and brute force attack.","",""

Using two popular representations of chemical space—the Coulomb matrix (CM) and pair-distribution/radial distribution curve (RDC)—we investigate the effect that the choice of representation has on the performance of our DNN. While CM and RDC featurisation are demonstrably robust descriptors, it is possible to obtain a smaller mean squared error (MSE) between the target and estimated XANES spectra when using RDC featurisation, and converge to this state a) faster and b) using fewer data samples.

How long should a network of neurons take to choose the best of N options? Theoretical results suggest that the optimal time grows as log(N), if the values of each option are imperfectly perceived. However, standard self-terminating neural network models of decision-making cannot achieve this optimal behavior. We show how using certain additional nonlinear response properties in neurons, which are ignored in standard models, results in a decision-making architecture that both achieves the optimal scaling of decision time and accounts for multiple experimentally observed features of neural decision-making. An elemental computation in the brain is to identify the best in a set of options and report its value. It is required for inference, decision-making, optimization, action selection, consensus, and foraging. Neural computing is considered powerful because of its parallelism; however, it is unclear whether neurons can perform this max-finding operation in a way that improves upon the prohibitively slow optimal serial max-finding computation (which takes ∼N⁡log(N) time for N noisy candidate options) by a factor of N, the benchmark for parallel computation. Biologically plausible architectures for this task are winner-take-all (WTA) networks, where individual neurons inhibit each other so only those with the largest input remain active. We show that conventional WTA networks fail the parallelism benchmark and, worse, in the presence of noise, altogether fail to produce a winner when N is large. We introduce the nWTA network, in which neurons are equipped with a second nonlinearity that prevents weakly active neurons from contributing inhibition. Without parameter fine-tuning or rescaling as N varies, the nWTA network achieves the parallelism benchmark. The network reproduces experimentally observed phenomena like Hick’s law without needing an additional readout stage or adaptive N-dependent thresholds. Our work bridges scales by linking cellular nonlinearities to circuit-level decision-making, establishes that distributed computation saturating the parallelism benchmark is possible in networks of noisy, finite-memory neurons, and shows that Hick’s law may be a symptom of near-optimal parallel decision-making with noisy input.","",""

The graph-based architecture of PIDGeuN provides a natural representation of the microgrid topology. Using only the state information that is practically measurable, PIDGeuN employs a time delay embedding for- mulation to fully reproduce the system dynamics, avoiding the dependency of conventional methods on internal dynamic states such as controllers. Based on a judiciously designed message passing mechanism, the PIDGeuN incorporates two physics- informed techniques to improve its prediction performance, including a physics-data-infusion approach to determining the inter-dependencies between buses, and a loss term to respect the known physical law of the power system, i.e., the Kirchhoff’s law, to ensure the feasibility of the model prediction. Extensive tests show that PIDGeuN can provide accurate and robust prediction of transient dynamics for nonlinear microgrids over a long-term time period. Therefore, the PIDGeuN offers a potent tool for the modeling of large scale networked microgrids (NMs), with potential applications to predictive or preventive control in real time applications for the stable and resilient operations of NMs.","",""

However, recent studies show that GNNs are vulnerable to carefully-crafted perturbations, called adversarial attacks. Adversarial attacks can easily fool GNNs in making predictions for downstream tasks. The vulnerability to adversarial attacks has raised increasing concerns for applying GNNs in safety-critical applications. Therefore, developing robust algorithms to defend adversarial attacks is of great significance. A natural idea to defend adversarial attacks is to clean the perturbed graph. It is evident that real-world graphs share some intrinsic properties. For example, many real-world graphs are low-rank and sparse, and the features of two adjacent nodes tend to be similar. In fact, we find that adversarial attacks are likely to violate these graph properties. Therefore, in this paper, we explore these properties to defend adversarial attacks on graphs. In particular, we propose a general framework Pro-GNN, which can jointly learn a structural graph and a robust graph neural network model from the perturbed graph guided by these properties. Extensive experiments on real-world graphs demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves significantly better performance compared with the state-of-the-art defense methods, even when the graph is heavily perturbed.

However, various working requirements and the oceanic environment may cause some uncertain and unfavorable factors for ship-mounted crane control. In particular, to accomplish different control tasks, some plant parameters (e.g., boom lengths, payload masses, and so on) frequently change; hence, most existing model-based controllers cannot ensure satisfactory control performance any longer. For example, inaccurate gravity compensation may result in positioning errors. Additionally, due to ship roll motions caused by sea waves, residual payload swing generally exists, which may result in safety risks in practice. To solve the above-mentioned issues, this paper designs a neural network-based adaptive control method that can provide effective control for both actuated and unactuated state variables based on the original nonlinear ship-mounted crane dynamics without any linearizing operations. In particular, the proposed update law availably compensates parameter/structure uncertainties for ship-mounted crane systems. Based on a 2-D sliding surface, the boom and rope can arrive at their preset positions in finite time, and the payload swing can be completely suppressed. Furthermore, the problem of nonlinear input dead zones is also taken into account.

However, such approaches continued to be limited by ad‐hoc approaches for incorporating tissue fibrous structure, high‐fidelity material models, and valve geometry. To this end, we developed an integrated tri‐leaflet valve pipeline built upon an isogeometric analysis framework. A high‐order structural tensor (HOST)‐based method was developed for efficient storage and mapping the two‐dimensional fiber structural data onto the valvular 3D geometry. We then developed a neural network (NN) material model that learned the responses of a detailed meso‐structural model for exogenously cross‐linked planar soft tissues.

SVS systems are required to synthesize a singing voice with pitch and timing that strictly follow a given musical score. Additionally, singing expressions that are not described on the musical score, such as vibrato and timing fluctuations, should be reproduced. The proposed system is composed of four modules: a time-lag model, a duration model, an acoustic model, and a vocoder, and singing voices can be synthesized taking these characteristics of singing voices into account.

In addition, we incorporated PeriodNet, a non-autoregressive neural vocoder with robustness for the pitch, into our systems to generate a high-fidelity singing voice waveform. Moreover, we propose automatic pitch correction techniques for DNN-based SVS to synthesize singing voices with correct pitch even if the training data has out-of-tune phrases.

The equations that define the model are derived from fundamental laws of physics and provide important relationships between state variables. Simulations using the model considered in this work produce good qualitative and quantitative results, but many parameters must be adjusted to reproduce a certain material behavior. The identification of model parameters is considered by solving an inverse problem that uses pseudo-experimental data to find the values that produce the best fit to the data. We apply a physics informed neural network and combine some classical estimation methods to identify the material parameters that appear in the damage equation of the model.

Command filters are presented to implement physical constraints on the virtual control laws, then the tedious analytic computations of time derivatives of virtual control laws are canceled. It is proved that the proposed robust backstepping control is able to guarantee semiglobal uniform ultimate boundedness of all signals in the closed-loop system. Finally, simulation results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive NN control.","",""

ABSTRACT Intestinal protozoa are responsible for relatively few infections in the developed world, but the testing volume is disproportionately high. Manual light microscopy of stool remains the gold standard but can be insensitive, time-consuming, and difficult to maintain competency. Artificial intelligence and digital slide scanning show promise for revolutionizing the clinical parasitology laboratory by augmenting the detection of parasites and slide interpretation using a convolutional neural network (CNN) model. The goal of this study was to develop a sensitive model that could screen out negative trichrome slides, while flagging potential parasites for manual confirmation. Conventional protozoa were trained as “classes” in a deep CNN. Between 1,394 and 23,566 exemplars per class were used for training, based on specimen availability, from a minimum of 10 unique slides per class. Scanning was performed using a 40× dry lens objective automated slide scanner. Data labeling was performed using a proprietary Web interface. Clinical validation of the model was performed using 10 unique positive slides per class and 125 negative slides. Accuracy was calculated as slide-level agreement (e.g., parasite present or absent) with microscopy. Positive agreement was 98.88% (95% confidence interval [CI], 93.76% to 99.98%), and negative agreement was 98.11% (95% CI, 93.35% to 99.77%). The model showed excellent reproducibility using slides containing multiple classes, a single class, or no parasites. The limit of detection of the model and scanner using serially diluted stool was 5-fold more sensitive than manual examinations by multiple parasitologists using 4 unique slide sets. Digital slide scanning and a CNN model are robust tools for augmenting the conventional detection of intestinal protozoa.","",""

The neural variability consistently decreases during behavioral tasks, in both sensory and motor cortices. The behavioral variability, on the other hand, changes depending on the difficulty of the task and animal performance.Here we study a mechanism for such variability in spiking neural network models with cluster topologies that enable multistability and attractor dynamics, features subserving functional roles such as decision-making, (working) memory and learning. Multistable attractors have been studied in spiking neural networks through clusters of strongly interconnected excitatory neurons. However, we show that this network topology results in the loss of excitation/inhibition balance and does not confer robustness against modulation of network activity. Moreover, it leads to widely separated firing rate states of single neurons, inconsistent with experimental observations.To overcome these problems we propose that a combination of excitatory and inhibitory clustering restores local excitation/inhibition balance. This network architecture is inspired by recent anatomical and physiological studies which point to increased local inhibitory connectivity and possible inhibitory clustering through connection strengths.We find that inhibitory clustering supports realistic spiking activity in terms of a biologically realistic firing rate, spiking irregularity, and trial-to-trial spike count variability. Furthermore, with the appropriate stimulation of network clusters, this network topology enabled us to qualitatively and quantitatively reproduce in vivo firing rate, variability dynamics and behavioral reaction times for different task conditions as observed in recordings from the motor cortex of behaving monkeys.","",""

Both methods come with a robust uncertainty estimate that incorporates information from the local conditions. They are validated against independent GO-SHIP bottle and sensor data, and compare favourably to other state-of-the-art mapping methods. As ""dynamic climatologies"" they show comparable performance to classical climatologies on large scales but a much better representation on smaller scales (40–120 d, 500–1500 km) compared to in situ data. The limits of these mappings are explored with pCO2 estimation in surface waters, i.e., at the edge of the domain with high intrinsic variability. In highly productive areas, there is a tendency for pCO2 overestimation due to decoupling of the O2 and C cycles by air-sea gas exchange, but global surface pCO2 estimates are unbiased compared to a monthly climatology. CANYON-B and CONTENT are highly useful as transfer functions between components of the ocean observing system (GO-SHIP repeat hydrography, BGC-Argo, underway observations) and permit the synergistic use of these highly complementary systems, both in spatial/temporal coverage and number of observations. Through easily and robotically-accessible observations they allow densification of more difficult-to-observe variables (e.g., 15 times denser AT and CT compared to direct measurements).

However, neuroscience research has increasingly emphasized network patterns of brain dynamics. Thus, the Euclidean structure of electrodes might not adequately reflect the interaction between signals. To fill the gap, a novel deep learning framework based on the graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs) was presented to enhance the decoding performance of raw EEG signals during different types of motor imagery (MI) tasks while cooperating with the functional topological relationship of electrodes. Based on the absolute Pearson's matrix of overall signals, the graph Laplacian of EEG electrodes was built up. The GCNs-Net constructed by graph convolutional layers learns the generalized features. The followed pooling layers reduce dimensionality, and the fully-connected softmax layer derives the final prediction. The introduced approach has been shown to converge for both personalized and group-wise predictions.

We found that motor cortex network states remained stable with respect to the critical network state during the extensive reorganization of both neural population activity and its relation to lever movement throughout learning.

In many applications, feed-forward neural networks are heavily involved in the implementation of controllers by learning and representing control laws through several methods such as model predictive control (MPC) and reinforcement learning (RL). The type of networks that we consider in this manuscript are feed-forward neural networks consisting of multiple hidden layers with ReLU activation functions and a linear activation function in the output layer. While neural network controllers have been able to achieve desirable performance in many contexts, they also present a unique challenge in that it is difficult to provide any guarantees about the correctness of their behavior or reason about the stability a system that employs their use. Thus, from a controls perspective, it is necessary to verify them in conjunction with their corresponding plants in closed-loop. While there have been a handful of works proposed towards the verification of closed-loop systems with feed-forward neural network controllers, this area still lacks attention and a unified set of benchmark examples on which verification techniques can be evaluated and compared. Thus, to this end, we present a range of closed-loop control systems ranging from two to six state variables, and a range of controllers with sizes in the range of eleven neurons to a few hundred neurons in more complex systems.

In recent years, advances in Artficial Intelligence (AI) have enabled a diverse range of technologies that are directly impacting people’s everyday lives [16]. Particularly, within this space, machine learning methods such as Deep Learning (DL) have achieved levels of accuracy and performance that are competitive or better than humans for tasks such as pattern and image recognition [12], natural language processing [7], and knowledge representation and reasoning [15,22]. Despite these achievements, there have been reservations about incorporating them into safety critical systems [11] due to their susceptibility to unexpected and errant behavior from a slight perturbation in their inputs [18]. Furthermore, neural networks are often viewed as ""black boxes"" since the underlying operation of the neuron activations is often indiscernible [22]. In light of these challenges, there has been significant work towards the creation of methods and verification tools that can formally reason about the behavior of neural networks [22]. However, the vast majority of these techniques have only been able to deal with feed-forward neural networks with piecewise-linear activation functions [4]. Additionally, the bulk of these methods have primarily considered the verification of input-output properties of neural networks in isolation [22], and there are only a handful of works that have explicitly addressed the verification of closed-loop control systems with neural network controllers [5, 8, 19–21]. One of the central challenges in verifying neural network control systems is that applying existing methodology to these systems is not straightforward [9], and a simple combination of verification tools for non-linear ordinary differential equations along with a neural network reachability tool suffers from severe overestimation errors [5]. Still, the verification of closed loop neural network systems is deeply important as they naturally arise in safety critical systems [5] such as autonomous vehicles, and complex control systems that make use of model predictive control and reinforcement learning [16]. Thus, there is a compelling need for methods and advanced software tools that can effectively deal with the complexities exhibited by these systems [5]. Inspired by a shortage of verification methods for closed-loop neural network control systems in the research literature, the central contribution of this paper is the provision of a set of executable benchmarks that have been synthesized using methods such as reinforcement learning [17], and model predictive control [14]. The problems elucidated in the paper are modeled using Simulink/Stateflow (SLSF) and are available at the following github repository1. We aim to provide a thorough problem description to which the numerous tools and approaches for non-linear systems and neural network verification present in the research community can be evaluated and compared [22]. If the research community is able to devise acceptable solutions to the aformentioned challenges they will stimulate the development of robust and intelligent systems with the potential to bring unparalleled benefits to numerous application domains. 2 Description of benchmarks. In this manuscript, we present a set of linear and non-linear closed-loop systems with continuoustime plants and feedforward neural networks controllers trained using different controls schemes such as reinforcement learning or model predictive control (MPC).

However, its vulnerability against presentation attacks poses a significant security threat. Though presentation attack detection (PAD) methods try to address this issue, they often fail in generalizing to unseen attacks. In this work, we propose a new framework for PAD using a one-class classifier, where the representation used is learned with a Multi-Channel Convolutional Neural Network (MCCNN). A novel loss function is introduced, which forces the network to learn a compact embedding for bonafide class while being far from the representation of attacks. A one-class Gaussian Mixture Model is used on top of these embeddings for the PAD task. The proposed framework introduces a novel approach to learn a robust PAD system from bonafide and available (known) attack classes. This is particularly important as collecting bonafide data and simpler attacks are much easier than collecting a wide variety of expensive attacks. The proposed system is evaluated on the publicly available WMCA multi-channel face PAD database, which contains a wide variety of 2D and 3D attacks. Further, we have performed experiments with MLFP and SiW-M datasets using RGB channels only. Superior performance in unseen attack protocols shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

In recent years, with the rapid development of deep learning, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been successfully applied in many fields, including HSI classification. However, the random gradient descent-based parameter updating scheme is too general and leading to the inefficiency of CNN models. Moreover, the high dimensionality and limited training samples of HSI data also exacerbate the overfitting problem. To tackle these issues, in this article, a novel deep network with multilayer and multibranch architecture, named 3-D Gabor CNN (3DG-CNN), is proposed for HSI classification. More precisely, since the predefined 3-D Gabor filters in multiple scales and orientations could well characterize the internal spatial–spectral structure of HSI data from various perspectives, the 3-D Gabor-modulated kernels (3-D GMKs) are employed to replace the random initialization kernels. Moreover, the specially designed multibranch architecture enables the network to better integrating the scalable property of 3-D Gabor filters; thus, the representative ability and robustness of the extracted features can be greatly improved. Alternatively, the number of network parameters is substantially reduced due to the incorporation of 3-D Gabor modulation, relieving the training complexity and also alleviating the training process from overfitting. Experimental results on four real HSI datasets (including two newly released ones in the literature) have demonstrated that the proposed 3DG-CNN model can achieve better performance than several widely used machine-learning-based and deep-learning-based approaches. For the sake of reproducibility, the codes of the proposed 3DG-CNN model are available at http://jiasen.tech/papers/.","",""

The proposed framework presents motion recognition for a Kinect-based NAO teleoperation. It allows the NAO robot to recognise the human motions and act as a human motion imitator. A stable whole-body imitation is still a challenging issue because of the difficulty in dynamic balancing of centre of mass (CoM). In this paper, a novel adaptive balancing technique for NAO (ABTN) is proposed to control the whole body in single as well as double supporting phases. It targets dynamic balancing of the humanoid robot by solving forward kinematics and applying a weighted average of mass with the CoMs of individual links with respect to the previous joint frames, which provides us with the dynamic CoM of the whole body. Our novel approach uses this dynamic CoM and calculates joint angles using proposed pitch and roll control algorithm to keep the dynamic CoM inside the stable region. Additionally, the NAO robot is capable of recognising human motions using the proposed 7-layer one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN). To solve the problem of variable length of time sequences, Zero padding is introduced with 1D-CNN. It attains a recognition accuracy of 95% as compared to the hidden Markov model and neural network.

Recently, trigger-set watermarking, breaking the white-box restriction, relying on adversarial training pre-defined (incorrect) labels for crafted inputs, and subsequently using them to verify the model authenticity, has been the main topic of DNN ownership verification. While these methods have successfully demonstrated robustness against removal attacks, few are effective against the tampering attacks from competitors forging the fake watermarks and dogging in the manager. In this paper, we put forth a new framework of the trigger-set watermark by embedding a unique Serial Number (relatedness less original labels) to the deep neural network for model ownership identification, which is both robust to model pruning and resist to tampering attacks.

METHODS MBI examinations obtained for clinical and research purposes from 2004 to 2015 were reviewed to classify the BPU pattern using a standardized five-category scale. Two expert radiologists provided interpretations that were used as the reference standard for modeling.

Model performance was summarized in data reserved to test the performance of the algorithm at the per-image and per-breast levels.   RESULTS Training was performed on 24,639 images from 3,133 unique patients. The model performance on the withheld testing data (6,172 images; 786 patients) was evaluated. Using direct matching on the predicted classification resulted in an accuracy of 69.4% (95% CI, 67.4% to 71.3%), and if prediction within one category was considered, accuracy increased to 96.0% (95% CI, 95.2% to 96.7%).

Upscaling instantaneous evapotranspiration retrieved at any specific time-of-day (ETi) to daily evapotranspiration (ETd) is a key challenge in mapping regional ET using polar orbiting sensors. Various studies have unanimously cited the shortwave incoming radiation (RS) to be the most robust reference variable explaining the ratio between ETd and ETi. This study aims to contribute in ETi upscaling for global studies using the ratio between daily and instantaneous incoming shortwave radiation (RSd ∕ RSi) as a factor for converting ETi to ETd. This paper proposes an artificial neural network (ANN) machine-learning algorithm first to predict RSd from RSi followed by using the RSd ∕ RSi ratio to convert ETi to ETd across different terrestrial ecosystems. Using RSi and RSd observations from multiple sub-networks of the FLUXNET database spread across different climates and biomes (to represent inputs that would typically be obtainable from remote sensors during the overpass time) in conjunction with some astronomical variables (e.g. solar zenith angle, day length, exoatmospheric shortwave radiation), we developed the ANN model for reproducing RSd and further used it to upscale ETi to ETd. The efficiency of the ANN is evaluated for different morning and afternoon times of day, under varying sky conditions, and also at different geographic locations. RS-based upscaled ETd produced a significant linear relation (R2 =  0.65 to 0.69), low bias (−0.31 to −0.56 MJ m−2 d−1; approx. 4 %), and good agreement (RMSE 1.55 to 1.86 MJ m−2 d−1; approx. 10 %) with the observed ETd, although a systematic overestimation of ETd was also noted under persistent cloudy sky conditions. Inclusion of soil moisture and rainfall information in ANN training reduced the systematic overestimation tendency in predominantly overcast days. An intercomparison with existing upscaling method at daily, 8-day, monthly, and yearly temporal resolution revealed a robust performance of the ANN-driven RS-based ETi upscaling method and was found to produce lowest RMSE under cloudy conditions. Sensitivity analysis revealed variable sensitivity of the method to biome selection and high ETd prediction errors in forest ecosystems are primarily associated with greater rainfall and cloudiness. The overall methodology appears to be promising and has substantial potential for upscaling ETi to ETd for field and regional-scale evapotranspiration mapping studies using polar orbiting satellites.","",""

Moreover, a fuzzy-neural-network inherited SMC (FNNISMC) scheme is proposed to relax the requirement of detailed system information and deal with chattering control efforts in the SMC system. In the FNNISMC strategy, the FNN framework is designed to mimic the SMC law, and adaptive tuning algorithms for network parameters are derived in the sense of projection algorithm and Lyapunov stability theorem to ensure the network convergence as well as stable control performance. Numerical simulations and experimental results of a two-link robot manipulator actuated by DC servo motors are provided to justify the claims of the proposed FNNISMC system, and the superiority of the proposed FNNISMC scheme is also evaluated by quantitative comparison with previous intelligent control schemes.","",""

We show how these algorithms can be exploited to successfully identify the nonlinearity in the system using neural-network models. By embedding the original problem in one with noise-perturbed state measurements, we present a class of identifiers (under L1 and L2 cost criteria) which secure a good approximant for the system nonlinearity provided that some global optimization technique is used.

This process should emerge in plastic neural networks evolving under behavioral feedback and should involve changes distributed across multiple synaptic sites. In eyeblink classical conditioning (EBCC), the cerebellum learns to predict the precise timing between two stimuli, hence EBCC represents an elementary yet meaningful paradigm to investigate the cerebellar network functioning. We have simulated EBCC mechanisms by reconstructing a realistic cerebellar microcircuit model and embedding multiple plasticity rules imitating those revealed experimentally. The model was tuned to fit experimental EBCC human data, estimating the underlying learning time-constants. Learning started rapidly with plastic changes in the cerebellar cortex followed by slower changes in the deep cerebellar nuclei. This process was characterized by differential development of long-term potentiation and depression at individual synapses, with a progressive accumulation of plasticity distributed over the whole network. The experimental data included two EBCC sessions interleaved by a trans-cranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). The experimental and the model response data were not significantly different in each learning phase, and the model goodness-of-fit was [Formula: see text] for all the experimental conditions. The models fitted on TMS data revealed a slowed down re-acquisition (sessions-2) compared to the control condition ([Formula: see text]). The plasticity parameters characterizing each model significantly differ among conditions, and thus mechanistically explain these response changes. Importantly, the model was able to capture the alteration in EBCC consolidation caused by TMS and showed that TMS affected plasticity at cortical synapses thereby altering the fast learning phase. This, secondarily, also affected plasticity in deep cerebellar nuclei altering learning dynamics in the entire sensory-motor loop. This observation reveals dynamic redistribution of changes over the entire network and suggests how TMS affects local circuit computation and memory processing in the cerebellum.","",""

In principle, this understanding would benefit of the development of an artificial system embedding the salient neuronal and plastic properties of the cerebellum and operating in closed-loop. To this aim, we have exploited a realistic spiking computational model of the cerebellum to analyze the network correlates of cerebellar impairment. The model was modified to reproduce three different damages of the cerebellar cortex: (i) a loss of the main output neurons (Purkinje Cells), (ii) a lesion to the main cerebellar afferents (Mossy Fibers), and (iii) a damage to a major mechanism of synaptic plasticity (Long Term Depression). The modified network models were challenged with an Eye-Blink Classical Conditioning test, a standard learning paradigm used to evaluate cerebellar impairment, in which the outcome was compared to reference results obtained in human or animal experiments. In all cases, the model reproduced the partial and delayed conditioning typical of the pathologies, indicating that an intact cerebellar cortex functionality is required to accelerate learning by transferring acquired information to the cerebellar nuclei. Interestingly, depending on the type of lesion, the redistribution of synaptic plasticity and response timing varied greatly generating specific adaptation patterns. Thus, not only the present work extends the generalization capabilities of the cerebellar spiking model to pathological cases, but also predicts how changes at the neuronal level are distributed across the network, making it usable to infer cerebellar circuit alterations occurring in cerebellar pathologies.","",""

Second, they require large pre-existing data sets, which are frequently unavailable and prohibitively expensive to produce. Here we describe a new strategy, the neural-network-biased genetic algorithm (NBGA), for combining genetic algorithms, machine learning, and high-throughput computation or experiment to discover materials with extremal properties in the absence of pre-existing data.

Based on many known properties of cortical neurons, hierarchical temporal memory (HTM) sequence memory recently has been proposed as a theoretical framework for sequence learning in the cortex. In this letter, we analyze properties of HTM sequence memory and apply it to sequence learning and prediction problems with streaming data. We show the model is able to continuously learn a large number of variable order temporal sequences using an unsupervised Hebbian-like learning rule. The sparse temporal codes formed by the model can robustly handle branching temporal sequences by maintaining multiple predictions until there is sufficient disambiguating evidence. We compare the HTM sequence memory with other sequence learning algorithms, including statistical methods—autoregressive integrated moving average; feedforward neural networks—time delay neural network and online sequential extreme learning machine; and recurrent neural networks—long short-term memory and echo-state networks on sequence prediction problems with both artificial and real-world data. The HTM model achieves comparable accuracy to other state-of-the-art algorithms. The model also exhibits properties that are critical for sequence learning, including continuous online learning, the ability to handle multiple predictions and branching sequences with high-order statistics, robustness to sensor noise and fault tolerance, and good performance without task-specific hyperparameter tuning. Therefore, the HTM sequence memory not only advances our understanding of how the brain may solve the sequence learning problem but is also applicable to real-world sequence learning problems from continuous data streams.","",""

Specifically, a novel three-branch convolution neural network, namely RRDNet (short for Robust Retinex Decomposition Network), is proposed to decompose the input image into three components, illumination, reflectance and noise. As an image-specific network, RRDNet doesn’t need any prior image examples or prior training. Instead, the weights of RRDNet will be updated by a zero-shot scheme of iteratively minimizing a specially designed loss function. Such a loss function is devised to evaluate the current decomposition of the test image and guide noise estimation.

We aim to penalize the too complicated RNN-LM by compensating for the uncertainty of the estimated model parameters, which is represented by a Gaussian prior. The objective function in a Bayesian classification network is formed as the regularized cross-entropy error function. The regularized model is constructed not only by calculating the regularized parameters according to the maximum a posteriori criterion but also by estimating the Gaussian hyperparameter by maximizing the marginal likelihood.

Abstract Shedding light on how biological systems represent, process and store information in noisy environments is a key and challenging goal. A stimulating, though controversial, hypothesis poses that operating in dynamical regimes near the edge of a phase transition, i.e., at criticality or the “edge of chaos”, can provide information-processing living systems with important operational advantages, creating, e.g., an optimal trade-off between robustness and flexibility. Here, we elaborate on a recent theoretical result, which establishes that the spectrum of covariance matrices of neural networks representing complex inputs in a robust way needs to decay as a power-law of the rank, with an exponent close to unity, a result that has been indeed experimentally verified in neurons of the mouse visual cortex. Aimed at understanding and mimicking these results, we construct an artificial neural network and train it to classify images. We find that the best performance in such a task is obtained when the network operates near the critical point, at which the eigenspectrum of the covariance matrix follows the very same statistics as actual neurons do. Thus, we conclude that operating near criticality can also have—besides the usually alleged virtues—the advantage of allowing for flexible, robust and efficient input representations.","",""

Persistent activity that lasts long after the stimulus offset has been considered a neural substrate for working memory. Attractor dynamics based on network interactions can successfully reproduce such persistent activity. However, it suffers from a fine-tuning of network connectivity, in particular, to form continuous attractors suggested for working memory encoding analog signals. Here, we investigate whether a specific form of synaptic plasticity rules can mitigate such tuning problems in two representative working memory models, namely, rate-coded and location-coded persistent activity. We consider two prominent types of plasticity rules, differential plasticity targeting the slip of instant neural activity and homeostatic plasticity regularizing the long-term average of activity, both of which have been proposed to fine-tune the weights in an unsupervised manner. Consistent with the findings of previous works, differential plasticity alone was enough to recover a graded-level persistent activity with less sensitivity to learning parameters. However, for the maintenance of spatially structured persistent activity, differential plasticity could recover persistent activity, but its pattern can be irregular for different stimulus locations. On the other hand, homeostatic plasticity shows a robust recovery of smooth spatial patterns under particular types of synaptic perturbations, such as perturbations in incoming synapses onto the entire or local populations, while it was not effective against perturbations in outgoing synapses from local populations. Instead, combining it with differential plasticity recovers location-coded persistent activity for a broader range of perturbations, suggesting compensation between two plasticity rules. Author Summary While external error and reward signals are essential for supervised and reinforcement learning, they are not always available. For example, when an animal holds a piece of information in mind for a short delay period in the absence of the original stimulus, it cannot generate an error signal by comparing its memory representation with the stimulus. Thus, it might be helpful to utilize an internal signal to guide learning. Here, we investigate the role of unsupervised learning for working memory maintenance, which acts during the delay period without external inputs. We consider two prominent classes of learning rules, namely, differential plasticity, which targets the slip of instant neural activity, and homeostatic plasticity, which regularizes the long-term average of activity. The two learning rules have been proposed to fine-tune the synaptic weights without external teaching signals. Here, by comparing their performance under various types of network perturbations, we reveal the conditions under which each rule can be effective and suggest possible synergy between them.","",""

An attractive feature of deep-learned methods is their ability to cope with appearance changes caused by day–night cycles and seasonal variations. However, deep learning of neural networks typically relies on large numbers of hand-annotated images, which requires significant effort for data collection and annotation. We present a method that allows autonomous, self-supervised training of a neural network in visual teach-and-repeat (VT&R) tasks, where a mobile robot has to traverse a previously taught path repeatedly. Our method is based on a fusion of two image registration schemes: one based on a Siamese neural network and another on point-feature matching. As the robot traverses the taught paths, it uses the results of feature-based matching to train the neural network, which, in turn, provides coarse registration estimates to the feature matcher. We show that as the neural network gets trained, the accuracy and robustness of the navigation increases, making the robot capable of dealing with significant changes in the environment. This method can significantly reduce the data annotation efforts when designing new robotic systems or introducing robots into new environments. Moreover, the method provides annotated datasets that can be deployed in other navigation systems. To promote the reproducibility of the research presented herein, we provide our datasets, codes and trained models online.","",""

Nonetheless, training a network for that task is challenging. In order to do so, one should face non-linear propagation of errors in the system. Small deviations from the desired dynamics due to error or inherent noise might have a dramatic effect in the future. A method to cope with these difficulties is thus needed. In this work we focus on recurrent networks with linear activation functions and binary output unit. We characterize its ability to reproduce a temporal sequence of actions over its output unit. We suggest casting the temporal learning problem to a perceptron problem. In the discrete case a finite margin appears, providing the network, to some extent, robustness to noise, for which it performs perfectly (i.e. producing a desired sequence for an arbitrary number of cycles flawlessly). In the continuous case the margin approaches zero when the output unit changes its state, hence the network is only able to reproduce the sequence with slight jitters. Numerical simulation suggest that in the discrete time case, the longest sequence that can be learned scales, at best, as square root of the network size. A dramatic effect occurs when learning several short sequences in parallel, that is, their total length substantially exceeds the length of the longest single sequence the network can learn. This model easily generalizes to an arbitrary number of output units, which boost its performance. This effect is demonstrated by considering two practical examples for sequence learning. This work suggests a way to overcome stability problems for training recurrent networks and further quantifies the performance of a network under the specific learning scheme.","",""

It can even memorize randomly labeled data, which has little knowledge behind the instance-label pairs. When a deep network continually learns over time by accommodating new tasks, it usually quickly overwrites the knowledge learned from previous tasks. Referred to as the neural variability, it is well known in neuroscience that human brain reactions exhibit substantial variability even in response to the same stimulus. This mechanism balances accuracy and plasticity/flexibility in the motor learning of natural nervous systems. Thus, it motivates us to design a similar mechanism, named artificial neural variability (ANV), that helps artificial neural networks learn some advantages from “natural” neural networks. We rigorously prove that ANV plays as an implicit regularizer of the mutual information between the training data and the learned model. This result theoretically guarantees ANV a strictly improved generalizability, robustness to label noise, and robustness to catastrophic forgetting. We then devise a neural variable risk minimization (NVRM) framework and neural variable optimizers to achieve ANV for conventional network architectures in practice. The empirical studies demonstrate that NVRM can effectively relieve overfitting, label noise memorization, and catastrophic forgetting at negligible costs.","",""

This is crucial both for viability and maturation, and the former also applies to human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Neuronal differentiation protocols from hESCs for neurotoxicology assessment studies should therefore provide standardized cell density requirements, and optimised coating matrix conditions. The effect of drug treatments may be masked by compound instability and degradation in cell culture medium but performing daily media changes can circumvent these issues.

Our analyses on image masking, Fourier spectrum sensitivity, and spread on discrete cosine energy spectrum reveal intriguing properties of ViT attributing to improved robustness.

Cross-frequency coupling (CFC) is associated with information integration across populations of neurons [1]. Impaired CFC is linked to neurological disease [2]. It is unclear what role CFC has in information processing and brain functional connectivity. We construct a model of CFC which predicts a computational role for observed θ − γ oscillatory circuits in the hippocampus and cortex [3]. Our model predicts that the complex dynamics in recurrent and feedforward networks of coupled oscillators performs robust information storage and pattern retrieval. Based on phasor associative memories (PAM) [4], we present a novel oscillator neural network (ONN) model [5] that includes subharmonic injection locking (SHIL) [6] and which reproduces experimental observations of CFC. We show that the presence of CFC increases the memory capacity of a population of neurons connected by plastic synapses. CFC enables error-free pattern retrieval whereas pattern retrieval fails without CFC. In addition, the trade-oﬀs between sparse connectivity, capacity, and information per connection are identiﬁed. The associative memory is based on a complex-valued neural network, or phasor neural network (PNN). We show that for values of Q which are the same as the ratio of γ to θ oscillations observed in the hippocampus and the cortex, the associative memory achieves greater capacity and information storage than previous models. The novel contri-butions of this work are providing a computational framework based on oscillator dynamics which predicts the functional role of neural oscillations and connecting concepts in neural network theory and dynamical system theory.

Moreover, the training of the RESN is facilitated by employing a bound optimization algorithm, based on which, a proper surrogate function is derived and the Laplace likelihood function is approximated by a Gaussian one, while remaining robust to outliers. It leads to an efficient method for estimating model parameters, which can be solved by using a Bayesian evidence procedure in a fully autonomous way.
