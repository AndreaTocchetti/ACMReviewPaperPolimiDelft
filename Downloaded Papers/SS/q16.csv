These models need to be rigorously audited for fairness, robustness, transparency, and interpretability. A variety of methods have been developed that focus on these issues in isolation, however, managing these methods in conjunction with model development can be cumbersome and timeconsuming. In this paper, we introduce a unified and model-agnostic approach to address these issues: Counterfactual Explanations for Robustness, Transparency, Interpretability, and Fairness of Artificial Intelligence models (CERTIFAI). Unlike previous methods in this domain, CERTIFAI is a general tool that can be applied to any black-box model and any type of input data. Given a model and an input instance, CERTIFAI uses a custom genetic algorithm to generate counterfactuals: instances close to the input that change the prediction of the model. We demonstrate how these counterfactuals can be used to examine issues of robustness, interpretability, transparency, and fairness. Additionally, we introduce CERScore, the first black-box model robustness score that performs comparably to methods that have access to model internals.","",""

Here, a knowledge‐and‐data‐driven laboratory diagnostic system is developed, termed AI‐based Lab tEst tO diagNosis (AI LEON), by integrating an innovative knowledge graph analysis framework and “mixed XGboost and Genetic Algorithm (MiXG)” technique to simulate the doctor's laboratory‐based diagnosis. To establish AI LEON, we included 89 116 949 laboratory data and 10 423 581 diagnosis data points from 730 113 participants. Among them, 686 626 participants were recruited for training and validating purposes with the remaining for testing purposes. AI LEON automatically identified and analyzed 2071 lab indexes, resulting in multiple disease recommendations that involved 441 common diseases in ten organ systems. AI LEON exhibited outstanding transparency and interpretability in three universal clinical application scenarios and outperformed human physicians in interpreting lab reports.

These include a variety of sensitive applications such as healthcare, finance, autonomous driving, criminal justice, and others which all pose significant concerns for fairness, robustness, safety, and trustworthiness. Despite these applications to critical tasks, deep networks are infamously referred to as black-box models because of their total lack of transparency in decision-making. If we are able to gain insight into how a model is coming to its conclusions, we are able to more clearly assess the trustworthiness and validity of its decisions. Consequently, an abundance of ongoing research is attempting to address model interpretability as the key problem to resolving these issues. There are many methods which are currently used to provide explanations of complex model predictions. LIME (Ribeiro et al., 2016) fits a local linear model around a data point, showing which features positively and negatively influence the prediction results. Despite the overall model being nonlinear, the local model gets an interpretable picture of how the model looks at small scales around the data point. Extensions of this method use other interpretable models like small decision tress. Shapley Values and SHAP follows a similar idea to assign a score to each feature, using a gametheoretic formulation which treats each feature as a player causing the final prediction (Lundberg and Lee, 2017). Its more rigorous formulation yields guarantees of its explanations summing up to the prediction score, but practically it usually must be estimated because of its high computational cost. Shuffle-based feature importance permutes the data of each feature to ascertain its importance in the final prediction in comparison to its normal prediction (Fisher et al., 2018). IG uses the fundamental theorem of calculus to provide additive explanations of a prediction (Sundararajan et al., 2017). This method is very popular in computer vision where its computational efficiency and saliency are prized, even though other work has exposed some of its shortcomings in providing an interpretation (Adebayo et al., 2018). Other methods are specifically designed for computer vision like TCAV (Kim et al., 2018) which finds a ‘concept direction’ corresponding to a large sample of concept images from the user. Surprisingly, all of these most popular interpretability methods share the same one limitation. None of these methods consider the shared importance of groups of two or more features; they only look at the effects had by each of the features individually. A feature interaction between two variables broadly describes a situation where both of the features/ variables are simultaneously important for a model’s prediction. In text applications for sentiment, ”not good” is a very simple example of two words strongly interacting with one another to create a negative sentiment. In modern-day applications, neural networks are usually hailed as amazing function approximators exactly because of their incredible ability to automatically uncover these kinds of complex relationships between the variables of the dataset.

Despite these benefits, the interpretability of AI-based systems or models remains vague. Attempts to address this issue had led to two novel explanation techniques, but none have shown enough robustness or comprehensiveness to be widely applied in AI and AMR control.

While these research problems have been extensively studied in isolation, an understanding of the trade-off between different pillars of trust is lacking. To this extent, the trade-off between fault tolerance, privacy and adversarial robustness is evaluated for the specific case of Deep Neural Networks, by considering two adversarial settings under a security and a privacy threat model. Specifically, this work studies the impact of the fault tolerance of the Neural Network on training the model by adding noise to the input (Adversarial Robustness) and noise to the gradients (Differential Privacy). While training models with noise to inputs, gradients or weights enhances fault tolerance, it is observed that adversarial robustness and fault tolerance are at odds with each other. On the other hand, ($\epsilon,\delta$)-Differentially Private models enhance the fault tolerance, measured using generalisation error, theoretically has an upper bound of $e^{\epsilon} - 1 + \delta$.

Bayesian networks learning methods require enough data to produce reliable results. Unfortunately, in practice, the training data are often either too few, expensive to label, or easy to be outdated. However, there may be sufficient labeled data that are available in a different but related domain. Learning reliable Bayesian networks from limited data is difficult; and transfer learning might be used to improve the robustness of learned networks by combining data from auxiliary and related labeled dataset. In this paper, we propose a novel transfer learning method for Bayesian networks for classification that considers both structure and parameter learning. Our solution is to first construct the initial Bayesian networks model for auxiliary labeled data, and then revise the model according to an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, structure and parameters are revised by turns, in order to make it applicable to the target unlabeled dataset. We mainly apply our method on a special type of Bayesian networks, namely tree-based Bayesian network. To validate our approach, we evaluated the method on a real and typical classification scenario - text classification problem. We compared our method with other transfer learning method as well as the traditional supervised and semi-supervised learning algorithms. The experimental results show that our algorithm is very effective and obtains a significant improvement when we transfer knowledge from related dataset.","",""

In contrast, explanation refers to the ability to accurately describe the mechanism, or implementation, that led to an algorithm’s output, often so that the algorithm can be improved in some way. Beyond these definitions, our review shows that humans differ from one another in systematic ways, that affect the extent to which they prefer to make decisions based on detailed explanations versus less precise interpretations. These individual differences, such as personality traits and skills, are associated with their abilities to derive meaningful interpretations from precise explanations of model output.

In addition, three machine learning algorithms, namely, support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbor (K-NN), and Naive Bayes, have been used for the WQC forecasting. The used dataset has 7 significant parameters, and the developed models were evaluated based on some statistical parameters. The results revealed that the proposed models can accurately predict WQI and classify the water quality according to superior robustness. Prediction results demonstrated that the NARNET model performed slightly better than the LSTM for the prediction of the WQI values and the SVM algorithm has achieved the highest accuracy (97.01%) for the WQC prediction. Furthermore, the NARNET and LSTM models have achieved similar accuracy for the testing phase with a slight difference in the regression coefficient (RNARNET = 96.17% and RLSTM = 94.21%). This kind of promising research can contribute significantly to water management.","",""

For these purposes, we collected a cohort of 267 breast cancer patients. The adopted dimensional reduction method determines the relevant subspace where distances among patients are used by a hierarchical clustering procedure to identify the corresponding optimal categories. Our results demonstrate how the molecular subtype is the most important feature for clustering. Then, we assessed the robustness of current therapies and guidelines; our findings show a striking correspondence between available patients’ profiles determined in an unsupervised way and either molecular subtypes or therapies chosen according to guidelines, which guarantees the interpretability characterizing explainable approaches to machine learning techniques.

However, health care has been relatively late to adopt them. This article provides clinical examples in which machine learning and artificial intelligence are already in use in health care and appear to deliver benefit. Three key bottlenecks toward increasing the pace of diffusion and adoption are methodological issues in evaluation of artificial intelligence-based interventions, reporting standards to enable assessment of model performance, and issues that need to be addressed for an institution to adopt these interventions. Methodological best practices will include external validation, ideally at a different site; use of proactive learning algorithms to correct for site-specific biases and increase robustness as algorithms are deployed across multiple sites; addressing subgroup performance; and communicating to providers the uncertainty of predictions. Regarding reporting, especially important issues are the extent to which implementing standardized approaches for introducing clinical decision support has been followed, describing the data sources, reporting on data assumptions, and addressing biases. Although most health care organizations in the United States have adopted electronic health records, they may be ill prepared to adopt machine learning and artificial intelligence. Several steps can enable this: preparing data, developing tools to get suggestions to clinicians in useful ways, and getting clinicians engaged in the process. Open challenges and the role of regulation in this area are briefly discussed. Although these techniques have enormous potential to improve care and personalize recommendations for individuals, the hype regarding them is tremendous. Organizations will need to approach this domain carefully with knowledgeable partners to obtain the hoped-for benefits and avoid failures.","",""

However, this approach is valid for monotonic transformation and narrow-banded processes. When the bandwidth of a random process is wide, no reasonable methods are available for acquiring the extreme value. This paper therefore applies the artificial neural network and genetic algorithm to do the extreme value prediction, without seeking rigorous mathematical derivations. Not only skewness and kurtosis are used, the spectral moments up to 4th-order reflecting bandwidth effects are also adopted. The results of many random case studies show that the artificial intelligence method is more accurate than the Hermite method in most of situations, especially for non-monotonic transformations.

Modern ML approaches such as artificial neural networks (ANNs) and tree boosting often perform better than more traditional methods like logistic regression. On the other hand, these modern methods yield a limited understanding of the resulting predictions. However, in the medical domain, understanding of applied models is essential, in particular, when informing clinical decision support. Thus, in recent years, interpretability methods for modern ML methods have emerged to potentially allow explainable predictions paired with high performance. To our knowledge, we present in this work the first explainability comparison of two modern ML methods, tree boosting and multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), to traditional logistic regression methods using a stroke outcome prediction paradigm. Here, we used clinical features to predict a dichotomized 90 days post-stroke modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score. For interpretability, we evaluated clinical features’ importance with regard to predictions using deep Taylor decomposition for MLP, Shapley values for tree boosting and model coefficients for logistic regression. With regard to performance as measured by Area under the Curve (AUC) values on the test dataset, all models performed comparably: Logistic regression AUCs were 0.83, 0.83, 0.81 for three different regularization schemes; tree boosting AUC was 0.81; MLP AUC was 0.83. Importantly, the interpretability analysis demonstrated consistent results across models by rating age and stroke severity consecutively amongst the most important predictive features. For less important features, some differences were observed between the methods. Our analysis suggests that modern machine learning methods can provide explainability which is compatible with domain knowledge interpretation and traditional method rankings. Future work should focus on replication of these findings in other datasets and further testing of different explainability methods.","",""

Yet, the explosion of nonstandardized reporting of high-performing algorithms are rendered useless without robust and streamlined implementation guidelines. The development of protocols and checklists will accelerate the translation of research publications to impact on patient care.   RECENT FINDINGS Beyond technological scepticism, we lack uniformity in analysing algorithmic performance generalizability, and benchmarking impacts across clinical settings. No regulatory guardrails have been set to minimize bias or optimize interpretability; no consensus clinical acceptability thresholds or systematized postdeployment monitoring has been set. Moreover, stakeholders with misaligned incentives deepen the landscape complexity especially when it comes to the requisite data integration and harmonization to advance the field. Therefore, despite increasing algorithmic accuracy and commoditization, the infamous 'implementation gap' persists. Open clinical data repositories have been shown to rapidly accelerate research, minimize redundancies and disseminate the expertise and knowledge required to overcome existing barriers. Drawing upon the longstanding success of existing governance frameworks and robust data use and sharing agreements, the ophthalmic community has tremendous opportunity in ushering artificial intelligence into medicine. By collaboratively building a powerful resource of open, anonymized multimodal ophthalmic data, the next generation of clinicians can advance data-driven eye care in unprecedented ways.

We are accustomed to applying tools that have been developed with a varying degree of human and computer input in our clinical practice. Representative examples include handcrafted diagnostic algorithms to triage patients presenting with acute illness (1), statistically derived scores for osteoporotic fracture risk assessment (2), and decision trees for the differentiation of benign and malignant ovarian masses (3). Common to all these tools is that changes to input parameters lead to predictable changes in model output, making them easy to interrogate and understand. More sophisticated, deep learning (DL)–based models employed in decision support systems have been implemented in clinical practice for the automated interpretation of electrocardiograms (4) and detection and classification of lesions on mammography (5). Although DL-based models have exciting potential to solve complex problems, their black box approach faces skepticism despite advances in interpretability and explainability (6). The recent, widespread availability of hardware and software for the development of AI solutions for medicine has inspired an exponential increase in publications. Data-rich medical specialties such as radiology have become a particular focus of rapid development. However, there are ample scope and encouraging initiatives for AI to support the delivery of care from general practice, primary care, the emergency department, and specialist diagnostics to patient self-care (7). This study by Tadavarthi and colleagues (8) has examined the market of AI-enabled image analysis solutions for radiology and provides recommendations for the evaluation of AI tools before purchase. In their market study, the authors illustrate how most solutions are focused on highvolume conditions. Unsurprisingly, many solutions focus on support for lesion detection and quantification rather than decision support for diagnosis and recommendations for management where regulatory stakes and hurdles are higher. Yet only a minority of solutions advertised at the Radiological Society of North America and Society of Imaging Informatics in Medicine annual meetings between November 2016 and June 2019 have received approval for the American or European market. This finding is indicative of a rapidly developing field where, after years of purely scientific development, the first tools start undergoing consolidation, approval, and marketing. The sole focus on solutions advertised at North American conferences risks missing tools by smaller companies with lower marketing budgets and introducing a geographic bias. Indeed, several other solutions have achieved Conformité Européenne marking or U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. Such approval or their equivalent in other territories is a precondition for the implementation of products, but it is by no means sufficient to identify clinically beneficial and financially viable tools. Overall, the adoption of these algorithms into clinical practice is emerging, and further work is needed to transform the scientific enthusiasm for developing advanced AI tools with a broader scope into clinically workable solutions. For tracking the ongoing market, surveys like this study (dating from November 2019) date quickly, leaving a gap for a living review and other market watchers. Tadavarthi et al contribute to a growing number of recommendations for the acquisition and adoption of AI solutions in medicine with a particular focus on radiology (9).

Traditional predictive analytics and clinical decision-support systems are intended to augment surgical decision-making, but their clinical utility is compromised by time-consuming manual data management and suboptimal accuracy. These challenges can be overcome by automated artificial intelligence models fed by livestreaming electronic health record data with mobile device outputs. This approach would require data standardization, advances in model interpretability, careful implementation and monitoring, attention to ethical challenges involving algorithm bias and accountability for errors, and preservation of bedside assessment and human intuition in the decision-making process.   Conclusions and Relevance Integration of artificial intelligence with surgical decision-making has the potential to transform care by augmenting the decision to operate, informed consent process, identification and mitigation of modifiable risk factors, decisions regarding postoperative management, and shared decisions regarding resource use.","",""

Different prototypes of CAD systems are currently developed under the Recherche Hospitalo-Universitaire en Santé / Personalized Focused Ultrasound Surgery of Localized Prostate Cancer (RHU PERFUSE) research programme, tackling challenging issues such as robustness across imaging protocols and magnetic resonance (MR) vendors, and ability to characterise cancer aggressiveness. The study primary objective is to evaluate the non-inferiority of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the final CAD system as compared with the Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System V.2.1 (PI-RADS V.2.1) in predicting the presence of ISUP ≥2 prostate cancer in patients undergoing prostate biopsy. Methods This prospective, multicentre, non-inferiority trial will include 420 men with suspected prostate cancer, a prostate-specific antigen level of ≤30 ng/mL and a clinical stage ≤T2 c. Included men will undergo prostate mpMRI that will be interpreted using the PI-RADS V.2.1 score. Then, they will undergo systematic and targeted biopsy. PHI will be assessed before biopsy. At the end of patient inclusion, MR images will be assessed by the final version of the CAD system developed under the RHU PERFUSE programme.

SUMMARY ANSWER We have combined computer vision image processing methods and deep learning techniques to create the non-invasive Life Whisperer AI model for robust prediction of embryo viability, as measured by clinical pregnancy outcome, using single static images of Day 5 blastocysts obtained from standard optical light microscope systems. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY Embryo selection following IVF is a critical factor in determining the success of ensuing pregnancy. Traditional morphokinetic grading by trained embryologists can be subjective and variable, and other complementary techniques, such as time-lapse imaging, require costly equipment and have not reliably demonstrated predictive ability for the endpoint of clinical pregnancy. AI methods are being investigated as a promising means for improving embryo selection and predicting implantation and pregnancy outcomes. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION These studies involved analysis of retrospectively collected data including standard optical light microscope images and clinical outcomes of 8886 embryos from 11 different IVF clinics, across three different countries, between 2011 and 2018. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS The AI-based model was trained using static two-dimensional optical light microscope images with known clinical pregnancy outcome as measured by fetal heartbeat to provide a confidence score for prediction of pregnancy. Predictive accuracy was determined by evaluating sensitivity, specificity and overall weighted accuracy, and was visualized using histograms of the distributions of predictions. Comparison to embryologists’ predictive accuracy was performed using a binary classification approach and a 5-band ranking comparison. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE The Life Whisperer AI model showed a sensitivity of 70.1% for viable embryos while maintaining a specificity of 60.5% for non-viable embryos across three independent blind test sets from different clinics. The weighted overall accuracy in each blind test set was >63%, with a combined accuracy of 64.3% across both viable and non-viable embryos, demonstrating model robustness and generalizability beyond the result expected from chance. Distributions of predictions showed clear separation of correctly and incorrectly classified embryos. Binary comparison of viable/non-viable embryo classification demonstrated an improvement of 24.7% over embryologists’ accuracy (P = 0.047, n = 2, Student’s t test), and 5-band ranking comparison demonstrated an improvement of 42.0% over embryologists (P = 0.028, n = 2, Student’s t test). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION The AI model developed here is limited to analysis of Day 5 embryos; therefore, further evaluation or modification of the model is needed to incorporate information from different time points. The endpoint described is clinical pregnancy as measured by fetal heartbeat, and this does not indicate the probability of live birth. The current investigation was performed with retrospectively collected data, and hence it will be of importance to collect data prospectively to assess real-world use of the AI model. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS These studies demonstrated an improved predictive ability for evaluation of embryo viability when compared with embryologists’ traditional morphokinetic grading methods. The superior accuracy of the Life Whisperer AI model could lead to improved pregnancy success rates in IVF when used in a clinical setting.

Modeling the full catalytic progression via first-principles statistical mechanics is impractical, if not impossible. Instead, we show here how a tailored artificial-intelligence approach can be applied, even to a small number of materials, to model catalysis and determine the key descriptive parameters (“materials genes”) reflecting the processes that trigger, facilitate, or hinder catalyst performance. We start from a consistent experimental set of “clean data,” containing nine vanadium-based oxidation catalysts. These materials were synthesized, fully characterized, and tested according to standardized protocols. By applying the symbolic-regression SISSO approach, we identify correlations between the few most relevant materials properties and their reactivity. This approach highlights the underlying physicochemical processes, and accelerates catalyst design. Impact statement Artificial intelligence (AI) accepts that there are relationships or correlations that cannot be expressed in terms of a closed mathematical form or an easy-to-do numerical simulation. For the function of materials, for example, catalysis, AI may well capture the behavior better than the theory of the past. However, currently the flexibility of AI comes together with a lack of interpretability, and AI can only predict aspects that were included in the training. The approach proposed and demonstrated in this IMPACT article is interpretable. It combines detailed experimental data (called ""clean data"") and symbolic regression for the identification of the key descriptive parameters (called ""materials genes"") that are correlated with the materials function. The approach demonstrated here for the catalytic oxidation of propane will accelerate the discovery of improved or novel materials while also enhancing physical understanding.

AI has the potential to process complex data sets, to be better at identifying subtle but important patterns, and to be more objective than humans when evaluating embryos. However, a current review of the literature shows much work is still needed before AI can be ethically implemented for this purpose. No randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been published, and the efficacy studies which exist demonstrate that algorithms can broadly differentiate well between ‘good-’ and ‘poor-’ quality embryos but not necessarily between embryos of similar quality, which is the actual clinical need. Almost universally, the AI models were opaque (‘black-box’) in that at least some part of the process was uninterpretable. This gives rise to a number of epistemic and ethical concerns, including problems with trust, the possibility of using algorithms that generalize poorly to different populations, adverse economic implications for IVF clinics, potential misrepresentation of patient values, broader societal implications, a responsibility gap in the case of poor selection choices and introduction of a more paternalistic decision-making process. Use of interpretable models, which are constrained so that a human can easily understand and explain them, could overcome these concerns. The contribution of AI to IVF is potentially significant, but we recommend that AI models used in this field should be interpretable, and rigorously evaluated with RCTs before implementation. We also recommend long-term follow-up of children born after AI for embryo selection, regulatory oversight for implementation, and public availability of data and code to enable research teams to independently reproduce and validate existing models.","",""

In this context, the data-driven approach has gained prominence due to its provision of insights for decision-making and easy implementation. The data-driven approach can discover various database patterns without relying on prior knowledge while also handling flexible objectives and multiple scenarios. This chapter reviews recent advances in data-driven optimization, highlighting the promise of data-driven optimization that integrates mathematical programming and machine learning (ML) for decision-making under uncertainty and identifies potential research opportunities. This chapter provides guidelines and implications for researchers, managers, and practitioners in operations research who want to advance their decision-making capabilities under uncertainty concerning data-driven optimization.

Objective The purpose of this systematic literature review was to identify and analyze quantitative studies utilizing or integrating AI to address and report clinical-level patient safety outcomes. Methods We restricted our search to the PubMed, PubMed Central, and Web of Science databases to retrieve research articles published in English between January 2009 and August 2019. We focused on quantitative studies that reported positive, negative, or intermediate changes in patient safety outcomes using AI apps, specifically those based on machine-learning algorithms and natural language processing. Quantitative studies reporting only AI performance but not its influence on patient safety outcomes were excluded from further review. Results We identified 53 eligible studies, which were summarized concerning their patient safety subcategories, the most frequently used AI, and reported performance metrics. Recognized safety subcategories were clinical alarms (n=9; mainly based on decision tree models), clinical reports (n=21; based on support vector machine models), and drug safety (n=23; mainly based on decision tree models). Analysis of these 53 studies also identified two essential findings: (1) the lack of a standardized benchmark and (2) heterogeneity in AI reporting. Conclusions This systematic review indicates that AI-enabled decision support systems, when implemented correctly, can aid in enhancing patient safety by improving error detection, patient stratification, and drug management. Future work is still needed for robust validation of these systems in prospective and real-world clinical environments to understand how well AI can predict safety outcomes in health care settings.","",""

Strikingly, the ACNN models did not require learning the essential protein-ligand interactions in complex structures and achieved similar performance even on datasets containing only ligand structures or only protein structures, while data splitting based on similarity clustering (protein sequence or ligand scaffold) significantly reduced the model performance. We also identified the property and topology biases in the DUD-E dataset which led to the artificially increased enrichment performance of virtual screening. The property bias in DUD-E was reduced by enforcing the more stringent ligand property matching rules, while the topology bias still exists due to the use of molecular fingerprint similarity as a decoy selection criterion.

The increasing demands upon radiologists’ time, expertise and energy depend not only on the absolute number of imaging examinations to be performed and reported (i.e., number of patients), but also on the progressively growing complexity of imaging datasets, in terms of the number of images to be analyzed, as well as the quality of information to be processed, especially in the case of advanced imaging examinations that require post-processing and detailed interpretation (1-3). Artificial intelligence (AI) is a breakthrough innovation involving computer-based algorithms tailored to analyze complex datasets (4,5). Moreover, AI is emerging as a potential game changer in many fields. In medical imaging for instance, AI showed promising results for lesion detection and quantification over a wide spectrum of clinical conditions, as well as speeding up workflows, improving accuracy, addressing resource scarcity, and reducing the costs of care (4-7). The most promising subset of AI is the so-called deep learning algorithm, in which the term “deep” is due to the artificial neural network architecture composed by multiple layers (8,9). To be effective as representative learning applications, deep learning algorithms require large amounts of imaging data for training. These models, that are able to automatically learn, and then label, features on archetypal images, have been shown to robustly mirror or even outperform humans in task-specific applications in some cases? (8-10). AI and deep learning are currently being tested for imaging processing in several anatomical regions and various clinical scenarios, including disorders of the chest (7,8). In this context, we read with great interest the recently published paper by Wu et al. (7), investigating the performance of AI model and human third-year radiology residents in interpreting chest radiographs. The novel deep learning AI algorithm that they tested was extensively trained with a large image database (i.e., 342,126 frontal chest radiographs), acquired at the emergency departments (ED) and urgent care settings in multiple hospitals. Anteroposterior (AP) and postero-anterior (PA) images were used to train the model, despite the comparison AI vs. human radiology residents was based on AP images only. Interestingly, the major results of the study showed no significant difference between the performance of the AI algorithm and human radiology residents in terms of sensitivity (P=0.66); however, specificity [reported for AI 0.980 (95% CI, 0.980–0.981)] and positive predictive value [reported for AI 0.730 (95% CI, 0.718–0.742)] showed statistically significant greater results for the AI algorithm (both with P<0.001).

Therefore, societal issues related to the use of AI and ML should not be ignored any longer and certainly not in the medical domain. These societal issues may take many forms, but they all entail the design of models from a human-centred perspective, incorporating human-relevant requirements and constraints. In this brief paper, we discuss a number of specific issues affecting the use of AI and ML in medicine, such as fairness, privacy and anonymity, explainability and interpretability, but also some broader societal issues, such as ethics and legislation.

We explored the factors that influence trust in these technologies and how they compare to established concepts of trust in the engineering discipline. By identifying the qualitatively and quantitatively assessed factors that influence trust in medical AI, we gain insight into understanding how autonomous systems can be optimized during the development phase to improve decision-making support and clinician-machine teaming. This facilitates an enhanced understanding of the qualities that healthcare professional users seek in AI to consider it trustworthy. We also highlight key considerations for promoting on-going improvement of trust in autonomous medical systems to support the adoption of medical technologies into practice. Background: decision support systems introduces challenges and barriers to adoption and implementation into clinical practice. Methods: We searched databases including, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, Clarivate Web of Science, and Google Scholar, as well as gray literature, for publications from 2000 to July 15, 2021, that reported features of AI-based diagnostic and clinical decision support systems that contribute to enhanced end-user trust.

However, it is unclear whether or how new approaches using advanced analytics, such as machine learning or artificial intelligence (AI), are exempt from well-known and long-standing challenges affecting clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) more generally. Vasey and colleagues4 conducted a systematic review of studies that compared clinicians’ diagnostic performance in interpreting imaging with and without the assistance of CDSS interventions based on machine learning.5 Of the 37 studies evaluated, most pertained to diagnosis of cancer or lung pathology and more than half assessed commercial CDSS technology. The authors found no robust evidence that clinicians made better diagnostic decisions when provided with support from machine-learning algorithms, suggesting that AI-based CDSSs are far from achieving their potential. This finding is similar for essentially all forms of AI-based decision support systems that have been evaluated to date. One explanation is that data amassed as part of providing usual care are, by their nature, messy and complex.1 Observational data are invariably deeply confounded in ways that will produce misleading associations because of selection bias, confounding by indication, immortal time bias, and observation-time bias. Additionally, data in electronic health records are entered by busy people with varying priorities on the information that they enter into the records and where, when, and how they enter that information. In clinical care, lack of documentation of a diagnosis, problem, finding, communication, or even an action does not constitute evidence that it did not exist or occur. The computer only knows what it is told—missing data and the meaning of gaps are informative but often are unknowable and may lead to further imprecision in AI-based CDSSs. A CDSS based on algorithms that are based on confounded or incomplete data will be confounded and provide inaccurate guidance. Even with big numbers and advanced modeling algorithms, predicting rare events is a fundamentally tough business, particularly when trying to predict a patient’s outcome or risks. All too often, investigators and those building AI-based CDSSs tout use of data from massive numbers of patients even as the actual event rate is low (eg, only 1 or 2%), which means that even when the area under the curve is as high as 0.9, the positive predictive value may not exceed 0.1, and the resulting false alarms will greatly outnumber true signals.6 Moreover, there is no agreement on the best metrics to categorize the performance of predictive algorithms. Metrics have included area under the receiver operating curve, confusion matrix, accuracy, positive predictive value/precision, recall/ sensitivity, precision-recall curve, specificity, negative predictive value, F1 score, number needed to screen, likelihood ratio, net reclassification index, stratification tables, and calibration curves. In addition, model performance inevitably degrades over time (because of population drift or more commonly, alterations in the underlying data structure) and when applied to data emanating from a different system or setting. Many experts now advocate not only that models be tested on multiple independent data sets, but that testing be conducted by independent investigators.6 + Related article","",""

With accumulating ALI datasets being publicly available, more knowledge could be discovered with sophisticated analytics. We reviewed literatures with big data analytics to understand the role of AI for improving the caring of patients with ALI/ARDS. Many studies have utilized the electronic medical records (EMR) data for the identification and prognostication of ARDS patients. As increasing number of ARDS clinical trials data is open to public, secondary analysis on these combined datasets provide a powerful way of finding solution to clinical questions with a new perspective. AI techniques such as Classification and Regression Tree (CART) and artificial neural networks (ANN) have also been successfully used in the investigation of ARDS problems.

Purpose To evaluate whether the diagnostic performance of radiologists in the differentiation of cancer from noncancer at dynamic contrast material-enhanced (DCE) breast MRI is improved when using an AI system compared with conventionally available software. Materials and Methods In a retrospective clinical reader study, images from breast DCE MRI examinations were interpreted by 19 breast imaging radiologists from eight academic and 11 private practices. Readers interpreted each examination twice. In the ""first read,"" they were provided with conventionally available computer-aided evaluation software, including kinetic maps. In the ""second read,"" they were also provided with AI analytics through computer-aided diagnosis software. Reader diagnostic performance was evaluated with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, with the area under the ROC curve (AUC) as a figure of merit in the task of distinguishing between malignant and benign lesions. The primary study end point was the difference in AUC between the first-read and the second-read conditions. Results One hundred eleven women (mean age, 52 years ± 13 [standard deviation]) were evaluated with a total of 111 breast DCE MRI examinations (54 malignant and 57 nonmalignant lesions). The average AUC of all readers improved from 0.71 to 0.76 (P = .04) when using the AI system. The average sensitivity improved when Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) category 3 was used as the cut point (from 90% to 94%; 95% confidence interval [CI] for the change: 0.8%, 7.4%) but not when using BI-RADS category 4a (from 80% to 85%; 95% CI: -0.9%, 11%). The average specificity showed no difference when using either BI-RADS category 4a or category 3 as the cut point (52% and 52% [95% CI: -7.3%, 6.0%], and from 29% to 28% [95% CI: -6.4%, 4.3%], respectively).

One extensively used method to minimize the cost and time for the drug development process is computer-aided drug design (CADD). CADD allows better focusing on experiments, which can reduce the time and cost involved in researching new drugs. In this context, structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) is robust and useful and is one of the most promising in silico techniques for drug design. SBVS attempts to predict the best interaction mode between two molecules to form a stable complex, and it uses scoring functions to estimate the force of non-covalent interactions between a ligand and molecular target. Thus, scoring functions are the main reason for the success or failure of SBVS software. Many software programs are used to perform SBVS, and since they use different algorithms, it is possible to obtain different results from different software using the same input. In the last decade, a new technique of SBVS called consensus virtual screening (CVS) has been used in some studies to increase the accuracy of SBVS and to reduce the false positives obtained in these experiments. An indispensable condition to be able to utilize SBVS is the availability of a 3D structure of the target protein. Some virtual databases, such as the Protein Data Bank, have been created to store the 3D structures of molecules. However, sometimes it is not possible to experimentally obtain the 3D structure. In this situation, the homology modeling methodology allows the prediction of the 3D structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence. This review presents an overview of the challenges involved in the use of CADD to perform SBVS, the areas where CADD tools support SBVS, a comparison between the most commonly used tools, and the techniques currently used in an attempt to reduce the time and cost in the drug development process. Finally, the final considerations demonstrate the importance of using SBVS in the drug development process.","",""

However, AI implication remains intricate for researchers/clinicians lacking specific training in computational tools and informatics. Cancer is a major cause of death worldwide, accounting for an estimated 9.6 million deaths in 2018. Certain cancers, such as pancreatic and gastric cancers, are detected only after they have reached their advanced stages with frequent relapses. Cancer is one of the most complex diseases affecting a range of organs with diverse disease progression mechanisms and the effectors ranging from gene-epigenetics to a wide array of metabolites. Hence a comprehensive study, including genomics, epi-genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, along with the medical/mass-spectrometry imaging, patient clinical history, treatments provided, genetics, and disease endemicity, is essential. Cancer Moonshot℠ Research Initiatives by NIH National Cancer Institute aims to collect as much information as possible from different regions of the world and make a cancer data repository. AI could play an immense role in (a) analysis of complex and heterogeneous data sets (multi-omics and/or inter-omics), (b) data integration to provide a holistic disease molecular mechanism, (c) identification of diagnostic and prognostic markers, and (d) monitor patient’s response to drugs/treatments and recovery.

The RT-PCR test, however, has an imperfect sensitivity (around 70%), is time-consuming and labor-intensive, and is in short supply, particularly in resource-limited countries. Therefore, automatic and accurate detection of COVID-19 using medical imaging modalities such as chest X-ray and Computed Tomography, which are more widely available and accessible, can be beneficial. We develop a novel hierarchical attention neural network model to classify chest radiography images as belonging to a person with either COVID-19, other infections, or no pneumonia (i.e., normal). We refer to this model as Artificial Intelligence for Detection of COVID-19 (AIDCOV). The hierarchical structure in AIDCOV captures the dependency of features and improves model performance while the attention mechanism makes the model interpretable and transparent.

AIDCOV has a sensitivity of 99.3%, a specificity of 99.98%, and a positive predictive value of 99.6% in detecting COVID-19 from chest radiography images.

The word-of-machine effect stems from a lay belief that AI recommenders are more competent than human recommenders in the utilitarian realm and less competent than human recommenders in the hedonic realm. As a consequence, importance or salience of utilitarian attributes determine preference for AI recommenders over human ones, and importance or salience of hedonic attributes determine resistance to AI recommenders over human ones (Studies 1–4). The word-of machine effect is robust to attribute complexity, number of options considered, and transaction costs. The word-of-machine effect reverses for utilitarian goals if a recommendation needs matching to a person’s unique preferences (Study 5) and is eliminated in the case of human–AI hybrid decision making (i.e., augmented rather than artificial intelligence; Study 6).

However, there are few variables available to determine the urgency of any given examination. Many lists simply use imaging location (eg, emergency, inpatient, outpatient) and the priority assigned by the ordering provider based on a clinical assessment of the patient’s symptoms. Ordering providers also may apply a high priority to an examination that does not require immediate interpretation but must be acquired quickly to accommodate a patient’s other appointments. Although this sort of prioritization serves as a guide to technologists to determine the order in which to perform the examinations, its application as a reading priority indicator has limitations and is fraught with errors. At some practices, an experienced imaging technologist may alert radiologists about imaging findings noticed while scanning that may need immediate if not urgent attention. Alternatively, the technologist may edit the priority level of the examination while sending it to the radiologists’ reading worklist. This practice, however, is not standard across the country. In this age of quality improvement, it may be prudent to augment these current practices with additional more sophisticated tools such as artificial intelligence (AI). A trained AI algorithm can be applied to everyday practice in critical time-dependent scenarios such as stroke and other acute intracranial findings such as intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) from nonstroke causes. A leading cause of death and disability worldwide, stroke kills approximately 140 000 Americans each year and is responsible for almost one death every 4 minutes (1). The use of CT to distinguish ischemic from hemorrhagic stroke is critical to establish early treatment options and to triage patients to appropriate management. The speed at which this determination is made greatly affects the success of treatment, such that door-to-diagnosis time and radiologist turnaround time (TAT) are included in national benchmarks and performance metrics of evolving reimbursement models. The rapidity of CT acquisition could be negated by the absence of appropriate prioritization, especially if stroke or ICH is unexpected or examinations are ordered from less urgent locations, as these studies could have a longer “shelf life” or wait time on a radiologist reading list. Examinations can be prioritized appropriately based on specific tags or labels placed at the time of ordering or by request after images have been obtained (2). This in turn expedites the interpretation by minimizing the wait time of an examination in the reading worklist. Osborne et al evaluated the impact of tagging studies as “stroke protocol,” which would prioritize them above emergent CT examinations. The average TAT for stroke protocol CT was 6.5 minutes compared with 17.3 minutes for emergent CT examinations. The improvement was the result of decreased “available-to-picked time,” which is combined with “radiologist reading time” to calculate TAT. Reading priorities can be set manually by technologists at end examination using a schema, which relies on many different variables. When these priorities are assigned numerical values, radiologists can easily identify the next most urgent study to read. Using this method, Gaskin et al reported significant improvement in the median TAT for the most urgent studies (critical, emergency department/ urgent, and inpatient/urgent), but the change was less (5%) in emergency department studies, presumably because examinations tagged with the emergency department location are by default interpreted first by radiologists (3). AI tools have the potential to go beyond variables known prior to an examination and incorporate information gleaned from the images themselves to impact radiologists and their workflow. Arbabshirani et al first evaluated Should Artificial Intelligence Tell Radiologists Which Study to Read Next?","",""

Formation bulk density (RHOB) logging data greatly assist in identifying downhole formations. These data are measured in the field while drilling by using a density log tool in the form of either a logging while drilling (LWD) technique or (more often) by wireline logging after the formations are drilled. This is due to operational limitations during the drilling process. Therefore, the objective of this study was to develop a predictive tool for estimating RHOB while drilling using an adaptive network-based fuzzy interference system (ANFIS), functional network (FN), and support vector machine (SVM). The proposed model uses the mechanical drilling constraints as feeding input parameters, and the conventional RHOB log data as an output parameter. These mechanical drilling parameters are usually measured while drilling, and their responses vary with different formations. A dataset of 2400 actual datapoints, obtained from a horizontal well in the Middle East, were used to build the proposed models. The obtained dataset was divided into a 70/30 ratio for model training and testing, respectively. The optimized ANFIS-based model outperformed the FN- and SVM-based models with a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.93, and average absolute percentage error (AAPE) of 0.81% between the predicted and measured RHOB values. These results demonstrate the reliability of the developed ANFIS model for predicting RHOB while drilling, based on the mechanical drilling parameters. Subsequently, the ANFIS-based model was validated using unseen data from another well within the same field. The validation process yielded an AAPE of 0.97% between the predicted and actual RHOB values, which confirmed the robustness of the developed model as an effective predictive tool for RHOB.","",""

We propose a model-agnostic interpretability method that involves training a simple recurrent neural network model to produce descriptive sentences to clarify the decision of deep learning classifiers.  We test our method on the task of detecting hip fractures from frontal pelvic x-rays. This process requires minimal additional labelling despite producing text containing elements that the original deep learning classification model was not specifically trained to detect.  The experimental results show that: 1) the sentences produced by our method consistently contain the desired information, 2) the generated sentences are preferred by doctors compared to current tools that create saliency maps, and 3) the combination of visualisations and generated text is better than either alone.","",""

Published studies were presented from two points of view: What medical aspects were covered? What AI/ML algorithms have been used? Methods We searched four electronic databases or studies that used AI/ML in hemodialysis (HD), peritoneal dialysis (PD), and kidney transplantation (KT). Sixty-nine studies were split into three categories: AI/ML and HD, PD, and KT, respectively. We identified 43 trials in the first group, 8 in the second, and 18 in the third. Then, studies were classified according to the type of algorithm. Results AI and HD trials covered: (a) dialysis service management, (b) dialysis procedure, (c) anemia management, (d) hormonal/dietary issues, and (e) arteriovenous fistula assessment. PD studies were divided into (a) peritoneal technique issues, (b) infections, and (c) cardiovascular event prediction. AI in transplantation studies were allocated into (a) management systems (ML used as pretransplant organ-matching tools), (b) predicting graft rejection, (c) tacrolimus therapy modulation, and (d) dietary issues. Conclusions Although guidelines are reluctant to recommend AI implementation in daily practice, there is plenty of evidence that AI/ML algorithms can predict better than nephrologists: volumes, Kt/V, and hypotension or cardiovascular events during dialysis. Altogether, these trials report a robust impact of AI/ML on quality of life and survival in G5D/T patients. In the coming years, one would probably witness the emergence of AI/ML devices that facilitate the management of dialysis patients, thus increasing the quality of life and survival.","",""

For training, data must be appropriately valued, and deals with AI companies must be centralized. Companies must clearly define anonymization and consent, and patients must be well-informed about their data usage. Data fed into algorithms must be made AI-ready by refining, purification, digitization and centralization. Finally, data must represent various demographics. AI needs to be safely integrated with radiologists-in-the-loop: guiding forming concepts of AI solutions and supervising training and feedback. To be well-regulated, AI systems must be approved by a health authority and agreements must be made upon liability for errors, roles of supervised and unsupervised AI and fair workforce distribution (between AI and radiologists), with a renewal of policy at regular intervals. Any errors made must have a root-cause analysis, with outcomes fedback to companies to close the loop—thus enabling a dynamic best prediction system.

A myriad of impactful ML applications already exists in orthopaedics ranging from predicting infections after surgery to diagnostic imaging. However, no systematic reviews that we know of have compared, in particular, the performance of ML models with that of clinicians in musculoskeletal imaging to provide an up-to-date summary regarding the extent of applying ML to imaging diagnoses. By doing so, this review delves into where current ML developments stand in aiding orthopaedists in assessing musculoskeletal images.   QUESTIONS/PURPOSES This systematic review aimed (1) to compare performance of ML models versus clinicians in detecting, differentiating, or classifying orthopaedic abnormalities on imaging by (A) accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, (B) input features (for example, plain radiographs, MRI scans, ultrasound), (C) clinician specialties, and (2) to compare the performance of clinician-aided versus unaided ML models.   METHODS A systematic review was performed in PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for studies published up to October 1, 2019, using synonyms for machine learning and all potential orthopaedic specialties. We included all studies that compared ML models head-to-head against clinicians in the binary detection of abnormalities in musculoskeletal images. After screening 6531 studies, we ultimately included 12 studies. We conducted quality assessment using the Methodological Index for Non-randomized Studies (MINORS) checklist. All 12 studies were of comparable quality, and they all clearly included six of the eight critical appraisal items (study aim, input feature, ground truth, ML versus human comparison, performance metric, and ML model description). This justified summarizing the findings in a quantitative form by calculating the median absolute improvement of the ML models compared with clinicians for the following metrics of performance: accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.   RESULTS ML models provided, in aggregate, only very slight improvements in diagnostic accuracy and sensitivity compared with clinicians working alone and were on par in specificity (3% (interquartile range [IQR] -2.0% to 7.5%), 0.06% (IQR -0.03 to 0.14), and 0.00 (IQR -0.048 to 0.048), respectively). Inputs used by the ML models were plain radiographs (n = 8), MRI scans (n = 3), and ultrasound examinations (n = 1). Overall, ML models outperformed clinicians more when interpreting plain radiographs than when interpreting MRIs (17 of 34 and 3 of 16 performance comparisons, respectively). Orthopaedists and radiologists performed similarly to ML models, while ML models mostly outperformed other clinicians (outperformance in 7 of 19, 7 of 23, and 6 of 10 performance comparisons, respectively). Two studies evaluated the performance of clinicians aided and unaided by ML models; both demonstrated considerable improvements in ML-aided clinician performance by reporting a 47% decrease of misinterpretation rate (95% confidence interval [CI] 37 to 54; p < 0.001) and a mean increase in specificity of 0.048 (95% CI 0.029 to 0.068; p < 0.001) in detecting abnormalities on musculoskeletal images.   CONCLUSIONS At present, ML models have comparable performance to clinicians in assessing musculoskeletal images. ML models may enhance the performance of clinicians as a technical supplement rather than as a replacement for clinical intelligence. Future ML-related studies should emphasize how ML models can complement clinicians, instead of determining the overall superiority of one versus the other. This can be accomplished by improving transparent reporting, diminishing bias, determining the feasibility of implantation in the clinical setting, and appropriately tempering conclusions.

Methods A novel questionnaire was distributed to patients attending fracture clinic in a large inner-city teaching hospital. Categorical and Likert scale questions were used to assess participant demographics, daily electronics use, pain score and perceptions towards AI used to assist in interpretation of their radiographs, and guide management. Results 216 questionnaires were included (M=126, F=90). Significantly higher confidence in clinician rather than AI-assisted interpretation was observed (clinician=9.20, SD=1.27 vs AI=7.06, SD=2.13), 95.4% reported favouring clinician over AI-performed interpretation in the event of disagreement. Small positive correlations were observed between younger age/educational achievement and confidence in AI-assistance.

All rights reserved. ISSN 0738-4602 66 AI MAGAZINE When one thinks about what it might take to build an intelligent system, it is evident that multiple capabilities will be required. Intelligence is generally considered to be reflected in the ability of a system to learn and understand the world around it, and to deal successfully with new or challenging situations. A closer look at what it might take to accomplish this reveals a surprisingly complex set of abilities that must work together. There are many variations on these themes, but roughly speaking, a robustly intelligent, autonomous agent embedded in the real world will need perceptual capabilities to sense and help interpret external signals and phenomena; a set of beliefs about the world, including itself and other agents, cause and effect, and a host of other things relevant to its survival and success in achieving its goals; a variety of reasoning capabilities to determine implications of its beliefs, understand its environment, plan ahead, solve problems, and so forth; a wide array of learning and adaptation capabilities; the ability to affect the world through action; and, some kind of rich communication mechanism along the lines of natural human language generation and understanding.  From Shakey the Robot to self-driving cars, from the personal computer to personal assistants on our phones, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has led the development of integrated artificial intelligence (AI) systems for more than half a century. From the earliest days of AI, it was apparent that a robust, generally intelligent system should include a complete set of capabilities: perception, memory, reasoning, learning, planning, and action; and when DARPA initiated AI research in the 1960s, ambitious projects such as Shakey the Robot went after the complete package. As DARPA realized the challenges, they backed away from the ultimate goal of integrated AI and tried to make progress on the individual problems of image understanding, speech and language understanding, knowledge representation and reasoning, planning and decision aids, machine learning, and robotic manipulation. Yet, even as researchers struggled to make progress in these subdisciplines, DARPA periodically resurrected the challenge of integrated intelligent systems and pushed the community to try again. In the 1980s, DARPA’s Strategic Computing Initiative took on challenges of integrated AI projects such as the Autonomous Land Vehicle and the Pilot’s Associate. These did not succeed, but instead set the stage for the several decades of more siloed research that followed, until it was time to try again. In the 2000s, DARPA took on the integrated AI problem again with its Grand Challenges, which led to the first self-driving cars, and projects such as the Personalized Assistant that Learns, which produced Apple’s Siri. These efforts created complex, richlyintegrated systems that represented quantum leaps ahead in machine intelligence. The integration of sophisticated capabilities in a fundamental way is the key to general intelligence. This is the story of DARPA’s persistent long-term support for this essential premise of AI.

Cybercriminals have learned how to use new techniques and robust tools to hack, attack, and breach data. Fortunately, Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies have been introduced into cyberspace to construct smart models for defending systems from attacks. Since AI technologies can rapidly evolve to address complex situations, they can be used as fundamental tools in the field of cybersecurity. Al-based techniques can provide efficient and powerful cyber defense tools to recognize malware attacks, network intrusions, phishing and spam emails, and data breaches, to name a few, and to alert security incidents when they occur.

This succinct narrative review describes the application, limitations and possible future of AI-based dental diagnostics, treatment planning and conduct, e.g. image analysis, prediction making, record keeping, as well as dental research and discovery. AI-based applications will streamline care, relieving the dental workforce from laborious routine tasks, a, predictive, preventive and participatory dentistry. However, AI solutions have not by large entered routine dental practice, mainly due to (1) limited data availability, accessibility, structure and comprehensiveness, (2) lacking methodological rigor and standards in their development, (3) and practical questions around the value and usefulness of these solutions, but also ethics and responsibility. Any AI application in dentistry should demonstrate tangible value by, e.g. by improving access to and quality of care, increasing efficiency and safety of services, empowering and enabling patients, supporting medical research, or increasing sustainability. Individual privacy, rights and autonomy need to be put front and center; a shift from centralized to distributed/federated learning may address this while improving scalability and robustness. Last, trustworthiness into and generalizability of dental AI solutions need to be guaranteed; the implementation of continuous human oversight and standards grounded in evidence-based dentistry should be expected. Methods to visualize, interpret and explain the logic behind AI solutions will contribute (“explainable AI”). Dental education will need to accompany the introduction of clinical AI solutions by fostering digital literacy in the future dental workforce.","",""

However, due to their over-parameterized black-box nature, it is often difficult to understand the prediction results of deep models. In recent years, many interpretation tools have been proposed to explain or reveal the ways that deep models make decisions. In this paper, we review this line of research and try to make a comprehensive survey. Specifically, we introduce and clarify two basic concepts— interpretations and interpretability—that people usually get confused. First of all, to address the research efforts in interpretations, we elaborate the design of several recent interpretation algorithms, from different perspectives, through proposing a new taxonomy. Then, to understand the results of interpretation, we also survey the performance metrics for evaluating interpretation algorithms. Further, we summarize the existing work in evaluating models’ interpretability using “trustworthy” interpretation algorithms. Finally, we review and discuss the connections between deep models’ interpretations and other factors, such as adversarial robustness and data augmentations, and we introduce several open-source libraries for interpretation algorithms and evaluation approaches.","",""

As the distances between people have been greatly shortened, there has been more general demand for the provision of personalized services aimed at groups instead of individuals. The existing methods for capturing group-level preference features from individuals have mostly been established via aggregation and face two challenges: 1) secure data management workflows are absent and 2) implicit preference feedback is ignored. To tackle these current difficulties, this article proposes secure AIoT for implicit group recommendations (SAIoT-GRs). For the hardware module, a secure Internet of Things structure is developed as the bottom support platform. For the software module, a collaborative Bayesian network model and noncooperative game are introduced as algorithms. This secure AIoT architecture is able to maximize the advantages of the two modules. In addition, a large number of experiments are carried out to evaluate the performance of SAIoT-GR in terms of efficiency and robustness.","",""

Materials and Methods PubMed MEDLINE and Embase databases were searched to identify original research articles published between January 1, 2018 and August 17, 2018 that investigated the performance of AI algorithms that analyze medical images to provide diagnostic decisions. Eligible articles were evaluated to determine 1) whether the study used external validation rather than internal validation, and in case of external validation, whether the data for validation were collected, 2) with diagnostic cohort design instead of diagnostic case-control design, 3) from multiple institutions, and 4) in a prospective manner. These are fundamental methodologic features recommended for clinical validation of AI performance in real-world practice. The studies that fulfilled the above criteria were identified. We classified the publishing journals into medical vs. non-medical journal groups. Then, the results were compared between medical and non-medical journals. Results Of 516 eligible published studies, only 6% (31 studies) performed external validation. None of the 31 studies adopted all three design features: diagnostic cohort design, the inclusion of multiple institutions, and prospective data collection for external validation. No significant difference was found between medical and non-medical journals. Conclusion Nearly all of the studies published in the study period that evaluated the performance of AI algorithms for diagnostic analysis of medical images were designed as proof-of-concept technical feasibility studies and did not have the design features that are recommended for robust validation of the real-world clinical performance of AI algorithms.","",""

Materials and Methods An enriched retrospective, fully crossed, multireader, multicase, HIPAA-compliant study was performed. Screening digital mammographic examinations from 240 women (median age, 62 years; range, 39-89 years) performed between 2013 and 2017 were included. The 240 examinations (100 showing cancers, 40 leading to false-positive recalls, 100 normal) were interpreted by 14 Mammography Quality Standards Act-qualified radiologists, once with and once without AI support. The readers provided a Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System score and probability of malignancy. AI support provided radiologists with interactive decision support (clicking on a breast region yields a local cancer likelihood score), traditional lesion markers for computer-detected abnormalities, and an examination-based cancer likelihood score. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), specificity and sensitivity, and reading time were compared between conditions by using mixed-models analysis dof variance and generalized linear models for multiple repeated measurements. Results On average, the AUC was higher with AI support than with unaided reading (0.89 vs 0.87, respectively; P = .002). Sensitivity increased with AI support (86% [86 of 100] vs 83% [83 of 100]; P = .046), whereas specificity trended toward improvement (79% [111 of 140]) vs 77% [108 of 140]; P = .06). Reading time per case was similar (unaided, 146 seconds; supported by AI, 149 seconds; P = .15). The AUC with the AI system alone was similar to the average AUC of the radiologists (0.89 vs 0.87). Conclusion Radiologists improved their cancer detection at mammography when using an artificial intelligence system for support, without requiring additional reading time.

Researchers have responded by developing AI tools to arm the public in the fight against social bots. Here we review the literature on different types of bots, their impact, and detection methods. We use the case study of Botometer, a popular bot detection tool developed at Indiana University, to illustrate how people interact with AI countermeasures. A user experience survey suggests that bot detection has become an integral part of the social media experience for many users. However, barriers in interpreting the output of AI tools can lead to fundamental misunderstandings. The arms race between machine learning methods to develop sophisticated bots and effective countermeasures makes it necessary to update the training data and features of detection tools. We again use the Botometer case to illustrate both algorithmic and interpretability improvements of bot scores, designed to meet user expectations. We conclude by discussing how future AI developments may affect the fight between malicious bots and the public.","",""

The accurate and more reliable prediction of TDG has a very significant role in preserving the diversity of aquatic organisms and reducing the phenomenon of fish deaths. Herein, two machine learning approaches called support vector regression (SVR) and extreme learning machine (ELM) have been applied to predict the saturated TDG% at USGS 14150000 and USGS 14181500 stations which are located in the USA. For the USGS 14150000 station, the recorded samples from 13 October 2016 to 14 March 2019 (75%) were used for training set, and the rest from 15 March 2019 to 13 October 2019 (25%) were used for testing requirements. Similarly, for USGS 14181500 station, the hourly data samples which covered the period from 9 June 2017 till 11 March 2019 were used for calibrating the models and from 12 March 2019 until 9 October 2019 were used for testing the predictive models. Eight input combinations based on different parameters have been established as well as nine statistical performance measures have been used for evaluating the accuracy of adopted models, for instance, not limited, correlation of determination (        R      2        ), mean absolute relative error (MAE), and uncertainty at 95% (        U      95        ). The obtained results of the study for both stations revealed that the ELM managed efficiently to estimate the TDG in comparison to SVR technique. For USGS 14181500 station, the statistical measures for ELM (SVR) were, respectively, reported as         R      2        of 0.986 (0.986), MAE of 0.316 (0.441), and         U      95        of 3.592 (3.869). Lastly, for USGS 14181500 station, the statistical measures for ELM (SVR) were, respectively, reported as         R      2        of 0.991 (0.991), MAE of 0.338 (0.396), and         U      95        of 0.832 (0.837). In addition, ELM’s training process computational time is stated to be much shorter than that of SVM. The results also showed that the temperature parameter was the most significant variable that influenced TDG relative to the other parameters. Overall, the proposed model (ELM) proved to be an appropriate and efficient computer-assisted technology for saturated TDG modeling that will contribute to the basic knowledge of environmental considerations.","",""
