It is desirable to develop automatic and accurate detection of COVID-19 using chest CT. Purpose To develop a fully automatic framework to detect COVID-19 using chest CT and evaluate its performance. Materials and Methods In this retrospective and multicenter study, a deep learning model, the COVID-19 detection neural network (COVNet), was developed to extract visual features from volumetric chest CT scans for the detection of COVID-19. CT scans of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and other non-pneumonia abnormalities were included to test the robustness of the model. The datasets were collected from six hospitals between August 2016 and February 2020. Diagnostic performance was assessed with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, and specificity. Results The collected dataset consisted of 4352 chest CT scans from 3322 patients. The average patient age (±standard deviation) was 49 years ± 15, and there were slightly more men than women (1838 vs 1484, respectively; P = .29). The per-scan sensitivity and specificity for detecting COVID-19 in the independent test set was 90% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 83%, 94%; 114 of 127 scans) and 96% (95% CI: 93%, 98%; 294 of 307 scans), respectively, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.96 (P < .001). The per-scan sensitivity and specificity for detecting CAP in the independent test set was 87% (152 of 175 scans) and 92% (239 of 259 scans), respectively, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.95 (95% CI: 0.93, 0.97). Conclusion A deep learning model can accurately detect coronavirus 2019 and differentiate it from community-acquired pneumonia and other lung conditions. © RSNA, 2020 Online supplemental material is available for this article.","",""

The robustness of AI algorithms is of great interest as inaccurate prediction could result in safety concerns and limit the adoption of AI systems. In this paper, we propose a framework based on design of experiments to systematically investigate the robustness of AI classification algorithms. A robust classification algorithm is expected to have high accuracy and low variability under different application scenarios. The robustness can be affected by a wide range of factors such as the imbalance of class labels in the training dataset, the chosen prediction algorithm, the chosen dataset of the application, and a change of distribution in the training and test datasets. To investigate the robustness of AI classification algorithms, we conduct a comprehensive set of mixture experiments to collect prediction performance results. Then statistical analyses are conducted to understand how various factors affect the robustness of AI classification algorithms. We summarize our findings and provide suggestions to practitioners in AI applications.","",""

Finally, the MS-CNN model is taken as the research object for improvement to explore the influence of label errors (p = 0.03, 0.05, 0.07, 0.09, 0.12) with different parameter settings and different probabilities (size of convolutional kernel, Dropout rate) on the recognition accuracy of MS-CNN model, at the same time, a CIR system platform based on MS-CNN model is built, and the recognition performance of salt and pepper noise images with different SNR (0, 0.03, 0.05, 0.07, 0.1) was compared, then the performance of the algorithm in the actual image recognition test was compared. The results show that the recognition accuracy is the highest (97.8%) when the convolution kernel size in the MS-CNN model is 2*2 and 3*3, and the average recognition accuracy is the highest (97.8%) when the dropout rate is 0.1; when the error probability of picture label is 12%, the recognition accuracy of the model constructed in this study is above 96%. Finally, the commodity image database constructed in this study is used to identify and verify the model. The recognition accuracy of the algorithm in this study is significantly higher than that of the Minitch stochastic gradient descent algorithm under different SNR conditions, and the recognition accuracy is the highest when SNR = 0 (99.3%).

In this article, we review the most recent efforts to improve confidence in the robustness of toxicological data and investigate the impact that data curation has on the confidence in model predictions. We also present two case studies demonstrating the effect of data curation on the performance of AI models for predicting skin sensitisation and skin irritation. We show that, whereas models generated with uncurated data had a 7–24% higher correct classification rate (CCR), the perceived performance was, in fact, inflated owing to the high number of duplicates in the training set.

This paper proposes a data-centric approach to addressing this problem. A nonlocal denoising method with different luminance values has been used to generate adversarial examples from the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database (MNIST) and Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR-10) data sets. Under perturbation, the method provided absolute accuracy improvements of up to 9.3% in the MNIST data set and 13% in the CIFAR10 data set. Training using transformed images with higher luminance values increases the robustness of the classifier. We have shown that transfer learning is disadvantageous for adversarial machine learning. The results indicate that simple adversarial examples can improve resilience and make deep learning easier to apply in various applications.","",""

In the 1990’s Winterstein proposed a cubic Hermite transformation using skewness and kurtosis, which has been widely applied in many areas for its accuracy and robustness. However, this approach is valid for monotonic transformation and narrow-banded processes. When the bandwidth of a random process is wide, no reasonable methods are available for acquiring the extreme value. This paper therefore applies the artificial neural network and genetic algorithm to do the extreme value prediction, without seeking rigorous mathematical derivations. Not only skewness and kurtosis are used, the spectral moments up to 4th-order reflecting bandwidth effects are also adopted. The results of many random case studies show that the artificial intelligence method is more accurate than the Hermite method in most of situations, especially for non-monotonic transformations.

Industry are conducting their digital shifts, and AI is becoming a cornerstone technology for making decisions out of the huge amount of (sensors-based) data available in the production floor. However, such technology may be disappointing when deployed in real conditions. Despite good theoretical performances and high accuracy when trained and tested in isolation, a Machine-Learning (M-L) model may provide degraded performances in real conditions. One reason may be fragility in treating properly unexpected or perturbed data. The objective of the paper is therefore to study the robustness of seven M-L and Deep-Learning (D-L) algorithms, when classifying univariate time-series under perturbations. A systematic approach is proposed for artificially injecting perturbations in the data and for evaluating the robustness of the models. This approach focuses on two perturbations that are likely to happen during data collection. Our experimental study, conducted on twenty sensors’ datasets from the public University of California Riverside (UCR) repository, shows a great disparity of the models’ robustness under data quality degradation. Those results are used to analyse whether the impact of such robustness can be predictable—thanks to decision trees—which would prevent us from testing all perturbations scenarios. Our study shows that building such a predictor is not straightforward and suggests that such a systematic approach needs to be used for evaluating AI models’ robustness.","",""

Artificial Intelligence (AI) analysis of 4-cell embryo classification is transferable across clinics globally with 79% accuracy.        Previous studies observing four-cell human embryo configurations have demonstrated that non-tetrahedral embryos (embryos in which cells make contact with fewer than 3 other cells) are associated with compromised blastulation and implantation potential. Previous research by this study group has indicated the efficacy of AI models in classification of tetrahedral and non-tetrahedral embryos with 87% accuracy, with a database comprising 2 clinics both from the same country (Brazil). This study aims to evaluate the transferability and robustness of this model on blind test data from a different country (France).        The study was a retrospective cohort analysis in which 909 4-cell embryo images (“tetrahedral”, n = 749; “non-tetrahedral”, n = 160) were collected from 3 clinics (2 Brazilian, 1 French). All embryos were captured at the central focal plane using Embryoscope™ time-lapse incubators. The training data consisted solely of embryo images captured in Brazil (586 tetrahedral; 87 non-tetrahedral) and the test data consisted exclusively of embryo images captured in France (163 tetrahedral; 72 non-tetrahedral).        The embryo images were labelled as either “tetrahedral” or “non-tetrahedral” at their respective clinics. Annotations were then validated by three operators. A ResNet–50 neural network model pretrained on ImageNet was fine-tuned on the training dataset to predict the correct annotation for each image. We used the cross entropy loss function and the RMSprop optimiser (lr = 1e–5). Simple data augmentations (flips and rotations) were used during the training process to help counteract class imbalances.        Our model was capable of classifying embryos in the blind French test set with 79% accuracy when trained with the Brazilian data. The model had sensitivity of 91% and 51% for tetrahedral and non-tetrahedral embryos respectively; precision was 81% and 73%; F1 score was 86% and 60%; and AUC was 0.61 and 0.64. This represents a 10% decrease in accuracy compared to when the model both trained and tested on different data from the same clinics.        Although strict inclusion and exclusion criteria were used, inter-operator variability may affect the pre-processing stage of the algorithm. Moreover, as only one focal plane was used, ambiguous cases were interpoloated and further annotated. Analysing embryos at multiple focal planes may prove crucial in improving the accuracy of the model.  Wider implications of the findings: Though the use of machine learning models in the analysis of embryo imagery has grown in recent years, there has been concern over their robustness and transferability. While previous results have demonstrated the utility of locally-trained models, our results highlight the potential for models to be implemented across different clinics.

The evolving neural network even exceeds the human cognitive level. However, the accuracy of these structures depends to some extent on the accuracy of the training data. Some well-designed generated antagonistic disturbances are sufficient to deceive model when added to images. Such attacks cause the classifiers trained by the neural network to misidentify the object and thus completely fail. On the other hand, the various existing defensive methods that have been proposed suffer from two criticisms. The first thing that bears the brunt is unsatisfactory detection rate due to low robustness toward the adversarial sample. Second, the excessive dependence on the output of specific network structure layers hinders the emergence of universal schemes. In this paper, we propose the large margin cosine estimation (LMCE) detection scheme to overcome the above shortcomings, making the detection independent and universal. We illustrate the principle of our approach and demonstrate the significance and analysis of some important parameters.

These ML programs must be both accurate and robust. Accuracy means the results must be trusted enough to substitute for the manual deduction process. Robustness is the magnitude to which the network can handle discrepancies within the images. One way to gauge the robustness is through the use of adversarial networks. Adversarial algorithms are trained using perturbations of the image to reduce the accuracy of an existing classification model. The greater degree of perturbations a model can withstand, the more robust it is. In this paper, comparisons of existing deep neural network models and the advancement of adversarial AI are explored. While there is some published research about AI and adversarial networks, very little discusses this particular utilization for overhead imagery. This paper focuses on overhead imagery, specifically that of ships. Using a public Kaggle dataset, we developed multiple models to detect ships in overhead imagery, specifically ResNet50, DenseNet201, and InceptionV3. The goal of the adversarial works is to manipulate an image so that its contents are misclassified. This paper focuses specifically on producing perturbations that can be recreated in the physical world. This serves to account for physical conditions, whether intentional or not, that could reduce accuracy within our network.

Experimental results confirm the validity of the selected subset and show that the proposed feature selection method can guarantee the model accuracy and reduces the computational time.One challenge of predicting building energy consumption is to accelerate model training when the dataset is very large.

The parallelization is performed on the most time-consuming work of training, i.e., to update the gradient vector f. The inner problems are dealt by sequential minimal optimization solver. The underlying parallelism is conducted by the shared memory version of Map-Reduce paradigm, making the system particularly suitable to be applied to multi-core and multiprocessor systems. Experimental results show that our implementation offers a high speed increase compared to Libsvm, and it is superior to the state-of-the-art MPI implementation Pisvm in both speed and storage requirement.","",""

While diversification may result in more generalizable AI-based systems, it can also introduce hidden variables. If neural networks are able to distinguish/learn hidden variables, these variables can introduce batch effects that compromise the accuracy of classification systems. Objective The objective of the study was to analyze the learnability of an exemplary selection of hidden variables (patient age, slide preparation date, slide origin, and scanner type) that are commonly found in whole slide image data sets in digital pathology and could create batch effects. Methods We trained four separate convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn four variables using a data set of digitized whole slide melanoma images from five different institutes. For robustness, each CNN training and evaluation run was repeated multiple times, and a variable was only considered learnable if the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval of its mean balanced accuracy was above 50.0%. Results A mean balanced accuracy above 50.0% was achieved for all four tasks, even when considering the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval. Performance between tasks showed wide variation, ranging from 56.1% (slide preparation date) to 100% (slide origin). Conclusions Because all of the analyzed hidden variables are learnable, they have the potential to create batch effects in dermatopathology data sets, which negatively affect AI-based classification systems. Practitioners should be aware of these and similar pitfalls when developing and evaluating such systems and address these and potentially other batch effect variables in their data sets through sufficient data set stratification.","",""

In this paper, we review recent progress in integrated photonic neuromorphic architectures and analyze the architectural and photonic hardware-based factors that limit their performance. Subsequently, we present our approach towards transforming silicon coherent neuromorphic layouts into high-speed and high-accuracy Deep Learning (DL) engines by combining robust architectures with hardware-aware DL training. Circuit robustness is ensured through a crossbar layout that circumvents insertion loss and fidelity constraints of state-of-the-art linear optical designs. Concurrently, we employ DL training models adapted to the underlying photonic hardware, incorporating noise- and bandwidth-limitations together with the supported activation function directly into Neural Network (NN) training. We validate experimentally the high-speed and high-accuracy advantages of hardware-aware DL models when combined with robust architectures through a SiPho prototype implementing a single column of a 4:4 photonic crossbar. This was utilized as the pen-ultimate hidden layer of a NN, revealing up to 5.93% accuracy improvement at 5GMAC/sec/axon when noise-aware training is enforced and allowing accuracies of 99.15% and 79.8% for the MNIST and CIFAR-10 classification tasks.

Attention mechanism originates from the study of human visual behavior, which has been widely used in various fields of artificial intelligence in recent years and has become an important part of neural network structure. Many attention mechanism-based trackers have gained improved performance in both accuracy and robustness. However, these trackers cannot suppress the influence of background information and distractors accurately and do not enhance the target object information, which limits the performance of these trackers. We propose new Siamese point attention (SPA) networks for robust visual tracking. SPA networks learn position attention and channel attention jointly on two branch information. To construct point attention, each point on the template feature is used to calculate the similarity on the search feature. The similarity calculation is based on the local information of the target object, which can reduce the influence of background, deformation, and rotation factors. We can obtain the region of interest by calculating the position attention from point attention. Position attention is integrated into the calculation of channel attention to reduce the influence of irrelevant areas. In addition, we also propose the object attention, and integrate it into the classification and regression module to further enhance the semantic information of the target object and improve the tracking accuracy. Extensive experiments are also conducted on five benchmark datasets. The experiment results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.","",""

In this approach, a deep learning classifier is first trained to identify the image blur type. Then, two encoder-decoder networks are trained and used alone or in combination to deblur the input image. It is an end-to-end approach and introduces no corrugated artifacts as traditional blind deconvolution methods do.

This work presents a novel stochastic-based and scalable hardware architecture and circuit design that computes a large-scale CNN with FPGA. The key idea is to implement all key components of a deep learning CNN, including multi-dimensional convolution, activation, and pooling layers, completely in the probabilistic computing domain in order to achieve high computing robustness, high performance, and low hardware usage. Our approach has three advantages. First, it can achieve significantly lower algorithmic complexity for any given accuracy requirement.

Second, this proposed stochastic-based architecture is highly fault-tolerant because the information to be processed is encoded with a large ensemble of random samples. As such, the local perturbations of its computing accuracy will be dissipated globally, thus becoming inconsequential to the final overall results. More interestingly, our measured results have shown that 0.1 percent degradation in computing accuracy of CNN can actually mitigate the well-known overfitting problem. Overall, being highly scalable and energy efficient, our stochastic-based convolutional neural network architecture is well-suited for a modular vision engine with the goal of performing real-time detection, recognition, and segmentation of mega-pixel images, especially those perception-based computing tasks that are inherently fault-tolerant, while still requiring high energy efficiency.","",""

Recent research has shown that the accuracy of recommendations can be improved significantly by using matrix factorization (MF) models. In particular, a mixed MF model was used by BellKor's Pragmatic Chaos to win the Netflix Prize. On the other hand, system designers must also be concerned about system robustness - the ability of the system to provide good recommendations when the system database is contaminated with some portion of noisy or erroneous data, perhaps maliciously entered by `profile injection' attackers intent on distorting system recommendations. In this paper, we focus on the robustness of MF based CF algorithms (MFCF), which usually transform the prediction of user preferences on items into a least squares problem, solved by gradient descent. As least squares is known to be sensitive to outliers, it is not surprising that MF algorithms are vulnerable to attack. Nevertheless a number of `robust statistics' have been proposed since the 1960's that provide alternative data fitting strategies that are less sensitive to outliers. In particular, in this paper, we propose a least trimmed squares based MF (LTSMF) to help improve the robustness of the least squares based MF (LSMF) models. Least trimmed squares is shown to be more robust than least squares and another popular robust method - M-estimator. Experiments also show that LTSMF outperforms previous robust CF models on both accuracy and robustness.","",""

These seven implementations are evaluated according to the classification accuracy achieved and according to their support of important system measures, such as robustness and validity. The results collected show that ANNs perform relatively well in terms of classification accuracy, though other implementations achieved higher results. However, ANNs provide excellent support of essential system measures. This leads to a well-rounded implementation, consisting of a good balance between accuracy and system features, and thus an effective technique for automated human chromosome classification.","",""

The development of such tools can add value as a diagnostic aid in the evaluation of tissue samples involved by lymphoma. A common diagnostic question is the determination of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) progression to accelerated CLL (aCLL) or transformation to diffuse large B‐cell lymphoma (Richter transformation; RT) in patients who develop progressive disease. The morphologic assessment of CLL, aCLL, and RT can be diagnostically challenging. Using established diagnostic criteria of CLL progression/transformation, we designed four artificial intelligence‐constructed biomarkers based on cytologic (nuclear size and nuclear intensity) and architectural (cellular density and cell to nearest‐neighbor distance) features. We analyzed the predictive value of implementing these biomarkers individually and then in an iterative sequential manner to distinguish tissue samples with CLL, aCLL, and RT. Our model, based on these four morphologic biomarker attributes, achieved a robust analytic accuracy. This study suggests that biomarkers identified using artificial intelligence‐based tools can be used to assist in the diagnostic evaluation of tissue samples from patients with CLL who develop aggressive disease features. © 2021 The Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

Materials and Methods In this multireader, multicase retrospective study, 14 radiologists assessed a dataset of 240 digital mammography images, acquired between 2013 and 2016, using a counterbalance design in which half of the dataset was read without AI and the other half with the help of AI during a first session and vice versa during a second session, which was separated from the first by a washout period. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and reading time were assessed as endpoints.   Results The average AUC across readers was 0.769 (95% CI: 0.724, 0.814) without AI and 0.797 (95% CI: 0.754, 0.840) with AI. The average difference in AUC was 0.028 (95% CI: 0.002, 0.055, P = .035). Average sensitivity was increased by 0.033 when using AI support (P = .021). Reading time changed dependently to the AI-tool score. For low likelihood of malignancy (< 2.5%), the time was about the same in the first reading session and slightly decreased in the second reading session. For higher likelihood of malignancy, the reading time was on average increased with the use of AI.   Conclusion This clinical investigation demonstrated that the concurrent use of this AI tool improved the diagnostic performance of radiologists in the detection of breast cancer without prolonging their workflow.Supplemental material is available for this article.© RSNA, 2020.","",""

It provides a simple, inexpensive and robust means of conducting in-field diagnosis without requiring internet connection and provides real-time results and advice. The present work evaluates the effectiveness of Nuru as an in-field diagnostic tool by comparing the diagnosis capability of Nuru to that of cassava experts (researchers trained on cassava pests and diseases), agricultural extension agents and farmers. Methods The diagnosis capability of Nuru and that of the assessed individuals was determined by inspecting cassava plants in-field and by using the cassava symptom recognition assessment tool (CaSRAT) to score images of cassava leaves. Results Nuru’s accuracy for symptom recognition when using six leaves (74 - 88%, depending on the condition) was similar to that of experts, 1.5-times higher than agricultural extension agents and two-times higher than farmers. Discussion These findings suggests that Nuru can be an effective tool for in-field diagnosis of cassava diseases and has a potential of being a quick and cost-effective means of disseminating knowledge from researchers to agricultural extension agents and farmers.","",""

A reader study compared the performance of 24 radiologists (13 of whom were breast subspecialists) reading 260 DBT examinations (including 65 cancer cases) both with and without AI. Readings occurred in two sessions separated by at least 4 weeks. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), reading time, sensitivity, specificity, and recall rate were evaluated with statistical methods for multireader, multicase studies.   Results Radiologist performance for the detection of malignant lesions, measured by mean AUC, increased 0.057 with the use of AI (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.028, 0.087; P < .01), from 0.795 without AI to 0.852 with AI.

Therefore, modelling and predicting water quality to control water pollution has been widely researched. The novelty of the proposed system is presented to develop an efficient operation of monitoring drinking water to ensure a sustainable and friendly green environment. In this work, the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) algorithm was developed to predict the water quality index (WQI). Feed-forward neural network (FFNN) and K-nearest neighbors were applied to classify water quality. The dataset has eight significant parameters, but seven parameters were considered to show significant values. The proposed methodology was developed based on these statistical parameters. Prediction results demonstrated that the ANFIS model was superior for the prediction of WQI values. Nevertheless, the FFNN algorithm achieved the highest accuracy (100%) for water quality classification (WQC). Furthermore, the ANFIS model accurately predicted WQI, and the FFNN model showed superior robustness in classifying the WQC. In addition, the ANFIS model showed accuracy during the testing phase, with a regression coefficient of 96.17% for predicting WQI, and the FFNN model achieved the highest accuracy (100%) for WQC. This proposed method, using advanced artificial intelligence, can aid in water treatment and management.","",""

All patients underwent dual-energy CEM examination in both craniocaudally (CC) and double acquisition of mediolateral oblique (MLO) projections (early and late). The reference standard was pathology from a surgical specimen for malignant lesions and pathology from a surgical specimen or fine needle aspiration cytology, core or Tru-Cut needle biopsy, and vacuum assisted breast biopsy for benign lesions. In total, 104 samples of 80 patients were analyzed. Furthermore, 48 textural parameters were extracted by manually segmenting regions of interest. Univariate and multivariate approaches were performed: non-parametric Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test; receiver operating characteristic (ROC), linear classifier (LDA), decision tree (DT), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), artificial neural network (NNET), and support vector machine (SVM) were utilized. A balancing approach and feature selection methods were used. The univariate analysis showed low accuracy and area under the curve (AUC) for all considered features. Instead, in the multivariate textural analysis, the best performance considering the CC view (accuracy (ACC) = 0.75; AUC = 0.82) was reached with a DT trained with leave-one-out cross-variation (LOOCV) and balanced data (with adaptive synthetic (ADASYN) function) and a subset of three robust textural features (MAD, VARIANCE, and LRLGE). The best performance (ACC = 0.77; AUC = 0.83) considering the early-MLO view was reached with a NNET trained with LOOCV and balanced data (with ADASYN function) and a subset of ten robust features (MEAN, MAD, RANGE, IQR, VARIANCE, CORRELATION, RLV, COARSNESS, BUSYNESS, and STRENGTH).
