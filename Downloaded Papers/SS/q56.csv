However, their robustness against adversarial attacks is criticized. Prior studies show that using unnoticeable modifications on graph topology or nodal features can significantly reduce the performances of GNNs. It is very challenging to design robust graph neural networks against poisoning attack and several efforts have been taken. Existing work aims at reducing the negative impact from adversarial edges only with the poisoned graph, which is sub-optimal since they fail to discriminate adversarial edges from normal ones. On the other hand, clean graphs from similar domains as the target poisoned graph are usually available in the real world. By perturbing these clean graphs, we create supervised knowledge to train the ability to detect adversarial edges so that the robustness of GNNs is elevated. However, such potential for clean graphs is neglected by existing work. To this end, we investigate a novel problem of improving the robustness of GNNs against poisoning attacks by exploring clean graphs. Specifically, we propose PA-GNN, which relies on a penalized aggregation mechanism that directly restrict the negative impact of adversarial edges by assigning them lower attention coefficients. To optimize PA-GNN for a poisoned graph, we design a meta-optimization algorithm that trains PA-GNN to penalize perturbations using clean graphs and their adversarial counterparts, and transfers such ability to improve the robustness of PA-GNN on the poisoned graph. Experimental results on four real-world datasets demonstrate the robustness of PA-GNN against poisoning attacks on graphs.","",""

Its feasibility is analyzed using maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) criterion and its robustness to uncertain noise conditions is compared to that of the conventional maximum likelihood (ML)-based classifiers. To reduce the design and training cost of DNN classifiers, a simple but effective pre-processing method is introduced and adopted. Furthermore, featuring multiple recurrent neural network (RNN) layers, the DNN modulation classifier is realized. Simulation results show that the proposed RNN-based classifier is robust to the uncertain noise conditions, and the performance of it approaches to that of the ideal ML classifier with perfect channel and noise information. Moreover, with a much lower complexity, it outperforms the existing ML-based classifiers, specifically, expectation maximization (EM) and expectation conditional maximization (ECM) classifiers which iteratively estimate channel and noise parameters. In addition, the proposed classifier is shown to be invariant to the signal distortion such as frequency offset. Furthermore, the adopted pre-processing method is shown to accelerate the training process of our proposed classifier, thus reducing the training cost.

Their intricate connections shape the diverse functions these networks perform. In comparison, the functional capabilities of models of spiking networks are still rudimentary. This shortcoming is mainly due to the lack of insight and practical algorithms to construct the necessary connectivity. Any such algorithm typically attempts to build networks by iteratively reducing the error compared to a desired output. But assigning credit to hidden units in multi-layered spiking networks has remained challenging due to the non-differentiable nonlinearity of spikes. To avoid this issue, one can employ surrogate gradients to discover the required connectivity in spiking network models. However, the choice of a surrogate is not unique, raising the question of how its implementation influences the effectiveness of the method. Here, we use numerical simulations to systematically study how essential design parameters of surrogate gradients impact learning performance on a range of classification problems. We show that surrogate gradient learning is robust to different shapes of underlying surrogate derivatives, but the choice of the derivative’s scale can substantially affect learning performance. When we combine surrogate gradients with a suitable activity regularization technique, robust information processing can be achieved in spiking networks even at the sparse activity limit. Our study provides a systematic account of the remarkable robustness of surrogate gradient learning and serves as a practical guide to model functional spiking neural networks.","",""

In this paper, we attempt to unravel three aspects related to the robustness of DNNs for face recognition: (i) assessing the impact of deep architectures for face recognition in terms of vulnerabilities to attacks inspired by commonly observed distortions in the real world that are well handled by shallow learning methods along with learning based adversaries; (ii) detecting the singularities by characterizing abnormal filter response behavior in the hidden layers of deep networks; and (iii) making corrections to the processing pipeline to alleviate the problem.

The on-going work on design and construction of spike-based hardware platforms offers an alternative for running deep neural networks with significantly lower power consumption, but has to overcome hardware limitations in terms of noise and limited weight precision, as well as noise inherent in the sensor signal.

Furthermore, the network performance of spiking DBNs is characterized with regard to noise in the spiking input signal. Our results demonstrate that spiking DBNs can tolerate very low levels of hardware bit precision down to almost two bits, and show that their performance can be improved by at least 30% through an adapted training mechanism that takes the bit precision of the target platform into account. Spiking DBNs thus present an important use-case for large-scale hybrid analog-digital or digital neuromorphic platforms such as SpiNNaker, which can execute large but precision-constrained deep networks in real time.","",""

As the estimates of unknown neural network approximation error bound and external disturbances bound are adjusted adaptively, the robustness of the closed-loop system is improved and the application scope of nonlinear systems is extended.

We observe that direct replacement of backbones with existing powerful architectures, such as ResNet and Inception, does not bring improvements.

ANALOG chips are being developed for use in applications where sophisticated signal processing at low power consumption is required. Signal processing via CNNs only becomes efficient if the network is implemented in analog hardware. In view of the physical limitations that analog implementations entail, robust operation of a CNN chip with respect to parameter variations has to be insured. By far not all mathematically possible CNN tasks can be carried out reliably on an analog chip; some of them are inherently too sensitive. This book defines a robustness measure to quantify the degree of robustness and proposes an exact and direct analytical design method for the synthesis of optimally robust network parameters. The method is based on a design centering technique which is generally applicable where linear constraints have to be satisfied in an optimum way. Processing speed is always crucial when discussing signal-processing devices. In the case of the CNN, it is shown that the setting time can be specified in closed analytical expressions, which permits, on the one hand, parameter optimization with respect to speed and, on the other hand, efficient numerical integration of CNNs. Interdependence between robustness and speed issues are also addressed. Another goal pursued is the unification of the theory of continuous-time and discrete-time systems. By means of a delta-operator approach, it is proven that the same network parameters can be used for both of these classes, even if their nonlinear output functions differ. More complex CNN optimization problems that cannot be solved analytically necessitate resorting to numerical methods. Among these, stochastic optimization techniques such as genetic algorithms prove their usefulness, for example in image classification problems. Since the inception of the CNN, the problem of finding the network parameters for a desired task has been regarded as a learning or training problem, and computationally expensive methods derived from standard neural networks have been applied. Furthermore, numerous useful parameter sets have been derived by intuition. In this book, a direct and exact analytical design method for the network parameters is presented. The approach yields solutions which are optimum with respect to robustness, an aspect which is crucial for successful implementation of the analog CNN hardware that has often been neglected. `This beautifully rounded work provides many interesting and useful results, for both CNN theorists and circuit designers.'

To achieve optimization, the process parameters must be adjusted in such a way that the deviations from target are minimized while the robustness to noise and to process fluctuations are maximized. This new method consists of an experiment reference template for designing and collecting training data samples, and a parallel distributed computational adaptive neural network system to provide a powerful tool for data modelling and empirical investigations. The relevant data is established using experimental design methods and highlighted in the case study. An adaptive GaRBF neural network is used to approximate the stochastically non-linear dynamics of the welding process to optimize the basic welding parameters. The neural network is trained with welding experimental data, tested and compared in an actual welding environment in terms of its ability to determine weld quality. The results show that the proposed adaptive neural network is capable of mapping the complex relationships between the welding parameters and the corresponding output weld quality. The implementation for this case study was carried out using a ‘semi-automatic’ welding facility, to mass weld a 20″ × 0.438″ pin/box onto a 20″ × 0.5″ × 37′ pipe (tubular drilling products), in an actual workshop which makes oilfield equipment.

Robustness is an appealing feature since a robust application provides a graceful degradation in performance once affected by perturbations in its structural parameters (e.g., associated with faults or finite precision representations). Minimality is related to model selection and attempts to reduce the computational load of the solution (with also silicon area and power consumption reduction in a digital implementation). A novel sensitivity analysis derived by the FPE selection criterion is suggested in the paper to quantify the relationship between performance loss and robustness; based on the definition of weak and acute perturbations, we introduce two criteria for estimating the robustness degree of a neural network.

This neural signal is generally chosen from a variety of well-studied electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. For a given BCI paradigm, feature extractors and classifiers are tailored to the distinct characteristics of its expected EEG control signal, limiting its application to that specific signal. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which have been used in computer vision and speech recognition to perform automatic feature extraction and classification, have successfully been applied to EEG-based BCIs; however, they have mainly been applied to single BCI paradigms and thus it remains unclear how these architectures generalize to other paradigms. Here, we ask if we can design a single CNN architecture to accurately classify EEG signals from different BCI paradigms, while simultaneously being as compact as possible (defined as the number of parameters in the model). Approach: In this work we introduce EEGNet, a compact convolutional neural network for EEG-based BCIs. We introduce the use of depthwise and separable convolutions to construct an EEG-specific model which encapsulates well-known EEG feature extraction concepts for BCI. We compare EEGNet, both for within-subject and cross-subject classification, to current state-of-the-art approaches across four BCI paradigms: P300 visual-evoked potentials, error-related negativity responses (ERN), movement-related cortical potentials (MRCP), and sensory motor rhythms (SMR). Results: We show that EEGNet generalizes across paradigms better than, and achieves comparably high performance to, the reference algorithms when only limited training data is available. We also show that EEGNet effectively generalizes to both ERP and oscillatory-based BCIs. In addition, we demonstrate three different approaches to visualize the contents of a trained EEGNet model to enable interpretation of the learned features. Significance: Our results suggest that EEGNet is robust enough to learn a wide variety of interpretable features over a range of BCI tasks, suggesting that the observed performances were not due to artifact or noise sources in the data.

Besides, we present a technical framework for fast and robust implementation of multipurpose UAV systems and develop a testbed for the evaluation of UAV control system by using a high-precision optical motion capture system. Both simulation results and experiment results demonstrate that the SPNN can reduce the inversion errors related to UAV parameter uncertainties as well as tracking errors related to unknown disturbances and unmodeled dynamics. With the help of an online neural network (NN) learning mechanism, the entire system can achieve much higher accuracy in attitude and trajectory control than that achieved by conventional proportional-integral derivative based control systems under varying flight conditions.","",""

The first step in this approach is to simulate a detailed converter circuit model or run experiments numerous times using different weighting factor combinations. The key performance metrics [e.g., average switching frequency ($f_{{\rm sw}}$) of the converter, total harmonic distortion, etc.] are extracted from each simulation. This data is then used to train the ANN, which serves as a surrogate model of the converter that can provide fast and accurate estimates of the performance metrics for any weighting factor combination. Consequently, any arbitrary user-defined fitness function that combines the output metrics can be defined and the weighting factor combinations that optimize the given function can be explicitly found. The proposed methodology was verified on a practical weighting factor design problem in FS-MPC regulated voltage source converter for uninterruptible power supply system. Designed weighting factors for two exemplary fitness functions turned out to be robust to load variations and to yield close to expected performance when applied both to detailed simulation model (less than 3% error) and to experimental test bed (less than 10% error).","",""

We show that the resulting optimization problem suffers from two severe issues: First, for deterministic DNNs, either the IB functional is infinite for almost all values of network parameters, making the optimization problem ill-posed, or it is piecewise constant, hence not admitting gradient-based optimization methods. Second, the invariance of the IB functional under bijections prevents it from capturing properties of the learned representation that are desirable for classification, such as robustness and simplicity. We argue that these issues are partly resolved for stochastic DNNs, DNNs that include a (hard or soft) decision rule, or by replacing the IB functional with related, but more well-behaved cost functions. We conclude that recent successes reported about training DNNs using the IB framework must be attributed to such solutions. As a side effect, our results indicate limitations of the IB framework for the analysis of DNNs. We also note that rather than trying to repair the inherent problems in the IB functional, a better approach may be to design regularizers on latent representation enforcing the desired properties directly.","",""

The main purpose is to establish an adaptive actor-critic control method, so that the cost function in the procedure of dealing with uncertainty is minimum and the closed-loop system is stable. Based on the neural network approximator, an action network is applied to generate the optimal control signal and a critic network is used to approximate the cost function, respectively. In contrast to the previous methods, the main features of this paper are: 1) the ACD scheme is integrated into the controllers to cope with the uncertainty and 2) a novel cost function, which is not in quadric form, is proposed so that the total cost in the design procedure is reduced. It is proved that the optimal control signals and the tracking errors are uniformly ultimately bounded even when the uncertainty exists. Finally, a numerical simulation is developed to show the effectiveness of the present approach.","",""

When multiple consecutive operations are applied to images, forensic analysts not only need to identify the existence of each manipulation operation, but also to distinguish the order of the involved operations. However, image operator chain detection is still a challenging problem. In this paper, an order forensics framework for detecting image operator chain based on convolutional neural network (CNN) is presented. Two-stream CNN architecture is designed to capture both tampering artifact evidence and local noise residual evidence. Specifically, the new CNN-based method is proposed for forensically detecting a chain made of two image operators, which could automatically learn manipulation detection features directly from image data. Further, we empirically investigate the robustness of our proposed method in two practical scenarios: forensic investigators have no access to the operating parameters, and manipulations are applied to a JPEG compressed image. Experimental results show that the proposed framework not only obtains significant detection performance but also can distinguish the order in some cases that previous works were unable to identify.","",""

However, in the search for new soft materials exhibiting properties and performance beyond those previously achieved, machine learning approaches are frequently limited by two shortcomings. First, because they are intrinsically interpolative, they are better suited to the optimization of properties within the known range of accessible behavior than to the discovery of new materials with extremal behavior. Second, they require large pre-existing data sets, which are frequently unavailable and prohibitively expensive to produce. Here we describe a new strategy, the neural-network-biased genetic algorithm (NBGA), for combining genetic algorithms, machine learning, and high-throughput computation or experiment to discover materials with extremal properties in the absence of pre-existing data. Within this strategy, predictions from a progressively constructed artificial neural network are employed to bias the evolution of a genetic algorithm, with fitness evaluations performed via direct simulation or experiment. In effect, this strategy gives the evolutionary algorithm the ability to ""learn"" and draw inferences from its experience to accelerate the evolutionary process. We test this algorithm against several standard optimization problems and polymer design problems and demonstrate that it matches and typically exceeds the efficiency and reproducibility of standard approaches including a direct-evaluation genetic algorithm and a neural-network-evaluated genetic algorithm. The success of this algorithm in a range of test problems indicates that the NBGA provides a robust strategy for employing informatics-accelerated high-throughput methods to accelerate materials design in the absence of pre-existing data.","",""

We further develop data augmentation and test-time fine-tuning methods to improve deep CAMA's robustness.

In this article, an radial basis function (RBF) neural network based adaptive robust control design is proposed for nonlinear bilateral teleoperation manipulators to cope with the main issues including the communication time delay, various nonlinearities, and uncertainties. Specifically, the slave environmental dynamics is modeled by a general RBF neural network, and its parameters are estimated and then transmitted for the environmental torque reconstruction in the master side. Since the parameters of the neural network (which are nonpower signals) are transmitted instead of the traditional environmental torque in the communication channel, the previous existing passivity problem under time delay is avoided. In both of master and slave sides, the trajectory creators are applied to generate the desired trajectories, and the RBF-neural-network-based adaptive robust controllers are designed subsequently to handle the nonlinearities and uncertainties. Theoretically, the proposed control algorithm can guarantee the global stability of bilateral teleoperation manipulators under time delay, and the good transparency performance with both position tracking and force feedback is also achieved simultaneously. The real platform comparative experiments are carried out, and the results show the good position tracking to execute precise operation and the good force feedback to detect the sudden disturbance in the environment dynamics.","",""
