In the era of industrial revolution, hybrid UGVs need to be autonomous with intelligent decision making capabilities. During wall climbing of hybrid UGVs, stability is essential and depends on real time feedback from multiple sensors. To increase stability and control, it is proposed that PID control loops should be replaced by AI based algorithms that reduce the decision time and mathematical complexity. For autonomous movement in any terrain using the proposed model, intelligent UGVs can map and localize simultaneously.They can make intelligent decisions about mode of movement i.e. driving on ground or wall, steering on ground or wall, flying and maneuvering by using real time sensor readings. Integration of the proposed AI models with HUGV can be applied to many areas which are hard for humans to access, for instance; inspection of large structures, bio & nuclear hazard environments, planetary exploration & magnetic fields detection.","",""

Here we develop a robust and smart floor monitoring system through the synergistic integration of highly reliable triboelectric coding mats and deep-learning-assisted data analytics. Two quaternary coding electrodes are configured, and their outputs are normalized with respect to a reference electrode, leading to highly stable detection that is not affected by the ambient parameters and operation manners. Besides, due to the universal electrode pattern design, all the floor mats can be screen-printed with only one mask, rendering higher facileness and cost-effectiveness. Then a distinctive coding can be implemented to each floor mat through external wiring, which permits the parallel-array connection to minimize the output terminals and system complexity. Further integrating with deep-learning-assisted data analytics, a smart floor monitoring system is realized for various smart home monitoring and interactions, including position/trajectory tracking, identity recognition, and automatic controls.

In such a way that, under a single adjustment, it is capable of damping different changes such as changes in the parameters, changes in the load, the input voltage, and the reference voltage. On the other hand, inverse optimal control is based on a discrete-time control Lyapunov function (CLF), and CLF candidate depends on fixed parameters that are selected to obtain the solution for inverse optimal control. Once these parameters have been found through heuristic or artificial intelligence methods, the new proposed methodology is capable of obtaining a robust optimal control scheme, without having to search for new parameters through other methods, since these are sometimes sensitive changes and many times the process of a new search is delayed. The results of the approach are simulated using Matlab, obtaining good performance of the proposed control under different operation conditions. Such simulations yielded errors of less than 1% based on the voltage reference, given the disturbances caused by changes in the input variables, system parameters, and changes in the reference.

A better understanding of the evolution of learning may help produce robust and adaptive agents, as well as shed light on open questions about the evolution of learning from biology. Evolutionary computation offers the benefits of precise experimental control, repeatability of experiments and rapid generational turnover – enabling experiments to test hypotheses that would be impossible or extremely time demanding to test in natural studies. The evolution of learning is influenced by the balance between the benefits offered by adaptivity and the costs (disadvantages) individuals pay for learning abilities. Such costs include forgetting previous knowledge, dangers of exploration and maintenance of neural structures for learning. This thesis focuses on how evolution regulates learning capacities to reap the benefits of being adaptive, while minimizing the costs of learning. The regulation of learning capacities is studied along three main axes: regulation through individual lifetimes, regulation within a population facing varying environments and regulation across neural modules. The study of learning regulation within individual lifetimes is inspired by the sensitive periods in learning observed in nature: limited periods within individuals’ lives where learning is temporarily facilitated. Experiments herein demonstrate that sensitive periods can emerge to schedule learning in tasks where there are dependencies between the learning of sub-tasks, and further explore how the flexibility of evolved sensitive periods depends on assumptions about which factors regulate plasticity. On the population level, the evolution of learning efforts is known to be highly dependent on the variability of the environment and the reliability of environmental stimuli. Evolving the innate preferences and learning rates of individuals across a wide range of environmental variability demonstrates that environments changing too rapidly or too slowly discourage the evolution of learning. Further experiments show how independently varying the degrees of environmental stability and stimuli reliability leads to a refinement of this model of learning, which also acknowledges the fact that learning may be disruptive or inefficient when stimuli are not reliable. One cost of learning is the risk of losing old information as new information is gained, a problem known as catastrophic forgetting. Evolving individuals facing a task with potential for catastrophic forgetting, it is demonstrated how the addition of an evolutionary cost of neural connections leads to more modular networks, which forget old skills less when learning a new skill. Together, the findings herein demonstrate several ways to handle the so-called stabilityplasticity dilemma: how can an individual be realized which has the flexibility to adapt without risking unstable behaviors and forgetting of old skills? The findings suggest ways in which evolution may have solved this problem in natural learners, and ways to harness the powers of evolution to mitigate this problem in artificial agents.","",""

Validation method was chosen to be the 10‐fold cross‐validation, and performance measures were selected to be the accuracy, the receiver operating characteristic curve, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Grid search and genetic algorithm were used for the hyperparameter tuning and weight tuning respectively. The results show that the proposed hybrid ensemble method has great potential in improving the prediction of slope stability.

A hard attention mask is learned concurrently to every task, through stochastic gradient descent, and previous masks are exploited to condition such learning. We show that the proposed mechanism is effective for reducing catastrophic forgetting, cutting current rates by 45 to 80%.

Robotic systems controlling is vital due to the wide range of application. Obviously stability and robustness are the most minimum requirements in control systems; even though the proof of stability and robustness is more important especially in the case of nonlinear systems. The strategies of robotic manipulators control are classified into two main groups: classical and non-classical methods, where the conventional control theory uses the classical method and the artificial intelligence theory (e.g., fuzzy logic, neural network, and neuro fuzzy) uses the non-classical methods. However both of classical and non-classical theories have applied successfully in many applications, but they also have some limitations. One of the best nonlinear robust controllers which can be used in uncertainty nonlinear systems is sliding mode controller (SMC).

Model-based algorithms have certain advantages over model-free algorithms in that their behavior is more stable and robust. Another aspect of robustness and stability of the algorithm has to do with the variability in the value of the performance measure returned by the algorithm. We will present a new model-building algorithm that builds the transition probability model simultaneously with the value function and a new variance-penalizing algorithm that exhibits robustness with respect to the performance measure. Keyword 1: Optimization Keyword 2: Algorithm, Artificial Intelligence, operations research. INTRODUCTION Reinforcement learning (Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis, 1996; Sutton and Barto, 1998; Gosavi, 2003) seeks to solve Markov decision processes or problems (MDPs) via simulation-based optimization. Much of the literature in reinforcement learning (RL) focusses on bypassing the construction of the transition probability matrices (TPMs) needed in dynamic programming (DP). Indeed, the ability to solve the MDP without generating the TPM is one of the reasons why RL can break the curses of modeling and dimensionality that plague DP. However, bypassing the TPM model does come with a cost. It makes the RL algorithm’s convergence dependent on selecting an appropriate step-size (learning rate). This results in the performance becoming highly susceptible to optimal tuning of parameters that define the step size. In this paper, we seek to develop a model-building algorithm that generates the TPM simultaneously with the value function. The other algorithm we develop is one that studies robustness with respect to the variability in the performance metric.","",""

A fundamental limitation on achieving control performance is the conflicting requirement of maintaining system stability. In general, the more aggressive is the controller, the better the control performance but also the closer to system instability.  Robust control is a collection of theories, techniques, and tools that form one of the leading edge approaches to control. Most controllers are designed not on the physical plant to be controlled, but on a mathematical model of the plant; hence, these controllers often do not perform well on the physical plant and are sometimes unstable. Robust control overcomes this problem by adding uncertainty to the mathematical model. The result is a more general, less aggressive controller which performs well on both the model and the physical plant. However, the robust control method also sacrifices some control performance in order to achieve its guarantees of stability.  Reinforcement learning based neural networks offer some distinct advantages for improving control performance. Their nonlinearity enables the neural network to implement a wider range of control functions, and their adaptability permits them to improve control performance via on-line, trial-and-error learning. However, neuro-control is typically plagued by a lack of stability guarantees. Even momentary instability cannot be tolerated in most physical plants, and thus, the threat of instability prohibits the application of neuro-control in many situations.  In this dissertation, we develop a stable neuro-control scheme by synthesizing the two fields of reinforcement learning and robust control theory. We provide a learning system with many of the advantages of neuro-control. Using functional uncertainty to represent the nonlinear and time-varying components of the neural networks, we apply the robust control techniques to guarantee the stability of our neuro-controller. Our scheme provides stable control not only for a specific fixed-weight, neural network, but also for a neuro-controller in which the weights are changing during learning. Furthermore, we apply our stable neuro-controller to several control tasks to demonstrate that the theoretical stability guarantee is readily applicable to real-life control situations. We also discuss several problems we encounter and identify potential avenues of future research.","",""

This paper, after explaining each control strategy in detail, finally compares these strategies for their pros and cons. Possible solutions to cope with the drawbacks have also been presented in tabular form.","",""

Examples of the tunable protocol parameters are: (1) a parameter that controls the degree to which traffic is spread over multiple paths; (2) a link bias parameter that, when large, increases stability by forcing traffic over minimum-hop paths; and (3) a parameter that determines how often routing updates are sent. Examples of measurements used to recognize adverse conditions are: (1) congestion; (2) probability of a successful transmission on a link; (3) jamming characteristics; and (4) degree of routing oscillations. Neural network methods were developed for predicting link-states and congestion, based on network measurements and estimates.

When the size and shape of a moving object have been changed, the correlator often accumulates walk-off error. The success of correlation-based tracking largely depends on choosing a suitable window size and position and thus transferring the proper reference image to the next frame. Since the AWA-FSF is capable of adjusting a reference image size more rapidly and properly, one can minimize the influence of complex background and clutter. In addition, one can finely tune the center point of the reference image repeatedly after the main tracking process. Thus one has increased stability and reliability of correlation-based image tracking. They tested the performance of the AWA-FSF using 45 real image sequences made of over 3400 images.","",""

Soft computing, as opposed to conventional “hard” computing, is a technique that is tolerant of imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth and approximation.  Its methods are based on the working of the human brain and it is commonly known as artificial intelligence. The human brain is capable of arriving at valid conclusions based on incomplete and partial data obtained from prior  experience. It is an approximation of this process on a very small scale that is used in soft computing. Some of the important branches of soft computing (SC) are artificial neural networks (ANNs), fuzzy logic (FL), genetic  computing (GC) and probabilistic reasoning (PR). The soft computing methods are robust and low cost.  It is to be noted that soft computing methods are used in such diverse fields as missile guidance, robotics, industrial plants, pattern recognition, market prediction, patient diagnosis, logistics and of course power system analysis and prediction. However in all these fields its application is comparatively new and research is being carried out continuously in many universities and  research institutions worldwide.

The accurate and more reliable prediction of TDG has a very significant role in preserving the diversity of aquatic organisms and reducing the phenomenon of fish deaths. Herein, two machine learning approaches called support vector regression (SVR) and extreme learning machine (ELM) have been applied to predict the saturated TDG% at USGS 14150000 and USGS 14181500 stations which are located in the USA. For the USGS 14150000 station, the recorded samples from 13 October 2016 to 14 March 2019 (75%) were used for training set, and the rest from 15 March 2019 to 13 October 2019 (25%) were used for testing requirements.

In addition, ELM’s training process computational time is stated to be much shorter than that of SVM.

SUMMARY ANSWER We have combined computer vision image processing methods and deep learning techniques to create the non-invasive Life Whisperer AI model for robust prediction of embryo viability, as measured by clinical pregnancy outcome, using single static images of Day 5 blastocysts obtained from standard optical light microscope systems. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY Embryo selection following IVF is a critical factor in determining the success of ensuing pregnancy. Traditional morphokinetic grading by trained embryologists can be subjective and variable, and other complementary techniques, such as time-lapse imaging, require costly equipment and have not reliably demonstrated predictive ability for the endpoint of clinical pregnancy. AI methods are being investigated as a promising means for improving embryo selection and predicting implantation and pregnancy outcomes. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION These studies involved analysis of retrospectively collected data including standard optical light microscope images and clinical outcomes of 8886 embryos from 11 different IVF clinics, across three different countries, between 2011 and 2018. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS The AI-based model was trained using static two-dimensional optical light microscope images with known clinical pregnancy outcome as measured by fetal heartbeat to provide a confidence score for prediction of pregnancy. Predictive accuracy was determined by evaluating sensitivity, specificity and overall weighted accuracy, and was visualized using histograms of the distributions of predictions. Comparison to embryologists’ predictive accuracy was performed using a binary classification approach and a 5-band ranking comparison. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE The Life Whisperer AI model showed a sensitivity of 70.1% for viable embryos while maintaining a specificity of 60.5% for non-viable embryos across three independent blind test sets from different clinics. The weighted overall accuracy in each blind test set was >63%, with a combined accuracy of 64.3% across both viable and non-viable embryos, demonstrating model robustness and generalizability beyond the result expected from chance. Distributions of predictions showed clear separation of correctly and incorrectly classified embryos. Binary comparison of viable/non-viable embryo classification demonstrated an improvement of 24.7% over embryologists’ accuracy (P = 0.047, n = 2, Student’s t test), and 5-band ranking comparison demonstrated an improvement of 42.0% over embryologists (P = 0.028, n = 2, Student’s t test). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION The AI model developed here is limited to analysis of Day 5 embryos; therefore, further evaluation or modification of the model is needed to incorporate information from different time points. The endpoint described is clinical pregnancy as measured by fetal heartbeat, and this does not indicate the probability of live birth. The current investigation was performed with retrospectively collected data, and hence it will be of importance to collect data prospectively to assess real-world use of the AI model. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS These studies demonstrated an improved predictive ability for evaluation of embryo viability when compared with embryologists’ traditional morphokinetic grading methods. The superior accuracy of the Life Whisperer AI model could lead to improved pregnancy success rates in IVF when used in a clinical setting. It could also potentially assist in standardization of embryo selection methods across multiple clinical environments, while eliminating the need for complex time-lapse imaging equipment. Finally, the cloud-based software application used to apply the Life Whisperer AI model in clinical practice makes it broadly applicable and globally scalable to IVF clinics worldwide.

Owing to their unique features, including low cost of production, easy chemical modification, high thermal stability, reproducibility, as well as low levels of immunogenicity and toxicity, aptamers can be used as an alternative to antibodies in diagnostics and therapeutics. Systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX), an experimental approach for aptamer screening, allows the selection and identification of in vitro aptamers with high affinity and specificity. However, the SELEX process is time consuming and characterization of the representative aptamer candidates from SELEX is rather laborious. Artificial intelligence (AI) could help to rapidly identify the potential aptamer candidates from a vast number of sequences. This review discusses the advancements of AI pipelines/methods, including structure-based and machine/deep learning-based methods, for predicting the binding ability of aptamers to targets. Structure-based methods are the most used in computer-aided drug design. For this part, we review the secondary and tertiary structure prediction methods for aptamers, molecular docking, as well as molecular dynamic simulation methods for aptamer–target binding. We also performed analysis to compare the accuracy of different secondary and tertiary structure prediction methods for aptamers. On the other hand, advanced machine-/deep-learning models have witnessed successes in predicting the binding abilities between targets and ligands in drug discovery and thus potentially offer a robust and accurate approach to predict the binding between aptamers and targets. The research utilizing machine-/deep-learning techniques for prediction of aptamer–target binding is limited currently. Therefore, perspectives for models, algorithms, and implementation strategies of machine/deep learning-based methods are discussed. This review could facilitate the development and application of high-throughput and less laborious in silico methods in aptamer selection and characterization.","",""

One extensively used method to minimize the cost and time for the drug development process is computer-aided drug design (CADD). CADD allows better focusing on experiments, which can reduce the time and cost involved in researching new drugs. In this context, structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) is robust and useful and is one of the most promising in silico techniques for drug design. SBVS attempts to predict the best interaction mode between two molecules to form a stable complex, and it uses scoring functions to estimate the force of non-covalent interactions between a ligand and molecular target. Thus, scoring functions are the main reason for the success or failure of SBVS software. Many software programs are used to perform SBVS, and since they use different algorithms, it is possible to obtain different results from different software using the same input. In the last decade, a new technique of SBVS called consensus virtual screening (CVS) has been used in some studies to increase the accuracy of SBVS and to reduce the false positives obtained in these experiments. An indispensable condition to be able to utilize SBVS is the availability of a 3D structure of the target protein. Some virtual databases, such as the Protein Data Bank, have been created to store the 3D structures of molecules. However, sometimes it is not possible to experimentally obtain the 3D structure. In this situation, the homology modeling methodology allows the prediction of the 3D structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence. This review presents an overview of the challenges involved in the use of CADD to perform SBVS, the areas where CADD tools support SBVS, a comparison between the most commonly used tools, and the techniques currently used in an attempt to reduce the time and cost in the drug development process.

The word-of-machine effect stems from a lay belief that AI recommenders are more competent than human recommenders in the utilitarian realm and less competent than human recommenders in the hedonic realm. As a consequence, importance or salience of utilitarian attributes determine preference for AI recommenders over human ones, and importance or salience of hedonic attributes determine resistance to AI recommenders over human ones (Studies 1–4). The word-of machine effect is robust to attribute complexity, number of options considered, and transaction costs. The word-of-machine effect reverses for utilitarian goals if a recommendation needs matching to a person’s unique preferences (Study 5) and is eliminated in the case of human–AI hybrid decision making (i.e., augmented rather than artificial intelligence; Study 6).

Here, we report on the development of a de novo, high-resolution and comparative genomics guided reverse-transcribed loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay.

This advanced AI algorithm-implemented LAMP (ai-LAMP) assay, targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene, showed high analytical sensitivity and specificity for SARS-CoV-2. A total of ~200 coronavirus disease (CoVID-19)-suspected NHS patient samples were tested using the platform and it was shown to be reliable, highly specific and significantly more sensitive than the current gold standard qRT-PCR. Therefore, this system could provide an efficient and cost-effective platform to detect SARS-CoV-2 in resource-limited laboratories.","",""

The use of artificial intelligence (AI) offers an opportunity to improve risk prediction. Here we compare the performance of an AI algorithm, the lung cancer prediction convolutional neural network (LCP-CNN), with that of the Brock University model, recommended in UK guidelines. Methods A dataset of incidentally detected pulmonary nodules measuring 5–15 mm was collected retrospectively from three UK hospitals for use in a validation study. Ground truth diagnosis for each nodule was based on histology (required for any cancer), resolution, stability or (for pulmonary lymph nodes only) expert opinion. There were 1397 nodules in 1187 patients, of which 234 nodules in 229 (19.3%) patients were cancer. Model discrimination and performance statistics at predefined score thresholds were compared between the Brock model and the LCP-CNN. Results The area under the curve for LCP-CNN was 89.6% (95% CI 87.6 to 91.5), compared with 86.8% (95% CI 84.3 to 89.1) for the Brock model (p≤0.005). Using the LCP-CNN, we found that 24.5% of nodules scored below the lowest cancer nodule score, compared with 10.9% using the Brock score. Using the predefined thresholds, we found that the LCP-CNN gave one false negative (0.4% of cancers), whereas the Brock model gave six (2.5%), while specificity statistics were similar between the two models. Conclusion The LCP-CNN score has better discrimination and allows a larger proportion of benign nodules to be identified without missing cancers than the Brock model. This has the potential to substantially reduce the proportion of surveillance CT scans required and thus save significant resources.","",""

In this context, ""intelligence"" is related to statistical and economic notions of rationality — colloquially, the ability to make good decisions, plans, or inferences. The adoption of probabilistic and decision-theoretic representations and statistical learning methods has led to a large degree of integration and cross-fertilization among AI, machine learning, statistics, control theory, neuroscience, and other fields. The establishment of shared theoretical frameworks, combined with the availability of data and processing power, has yielded remarkable successes in various component tasks such as speech recognition, image classification, autonomous vehicles, machine translation, legged locomotion, and question-answering systems. As capabilities in these areas and others cross the threshold from laboratory research to economically valuable technologies, a virtuous cycle takes hold whereby even small improvements in performance are worth large sums of money, prompting greater investments in research. There is now a broad consensus that AI research is progressing steadily, and that its impact on society is likely to increase. The potential benefits are huge, since everything that civilization has to offer is a product of human intelligence; we cannot predict what we might achieve when this intelligence is magnified by the tools AI may provide, but the eradication of disease and poverty are not unfathomable. Because of the great potential of AI, it is important to research how to reap its benefits while avoiding potential pitfalls. The progress in AI research makes it timely to focus research not only on making AI more capable, but also on maximizing the societal benefit of AI. Such considerations motivated the AAAI 2008–09 Presidential Panel on Long-Term AI Futures and other projects on AI impacts, and constitute a significant expansion of the field of AI itself, which up to now has focused largely on techniques that are neutral with respect to purpose. We recommend expanded research aimed at ensuring that increasingly capable AI systems are robust and beneficial: our AI systems must do what we want them to do. The attached research priorities document [see page X] gives many examples of such research directions that can help maximize the societal benefit of AI. This research is by necessity interdisciplinary, because it involves both society and AI. It ranges from economics, law and philosophy to computer security, formal methods and, of course, various branches of AI itself. In summary, we believe that research on how to make AI systems robust and beneficial is both important and timely, and that there are concrete research directions that can be pursued today.","",""

Formation bulk density (RHOB) logging data greatly assist in identifying downhole formations. These data are measured in the field while drilling by using a density log tool in the form of either a logging while drilling (LWD) technique or (more often) by wireline logging after the formations are drilled. This is due to operational limitations during the drilling process. Therefore, the objective of this study was to develop a predictive tool for estimating RHOB while drilling using an adaptive network-based fuzzy interference system (ANFIS), functional network (FN), and support vector machine (SVM). The proposed model uses the mechanical drilling constraints as feeding input parameters, and the conventional RHOB log data as an output parameter. These mechanical drilling parameters are usually measured while drilling, and their responses vary with different formations. A dataset of 2400 actual datapoints, obtained from a horizontal well in the Middle East, were used to build the proposed models. The obtained dataset was divided into a 70/30 ratio for model training and testing, respectively. The optimized ANFIS-based model outperformed the FN- and SVM-based models with a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.93, and average absolute percentage error (AAPE) of 0.81% between the predicted and measured RHOB values. These results demonstrate the reliability of the developed ANFIS model for predicting RHOB while drilling, based on the mechanical drilling parameters. Subsequently, the ANFIS-based model was validated using unseen data from another well within the same field. The validation process yielded an AAPE of 0.97% between the predicted and actual RHOB values, which confirmed the robustness of the developed model as an effective predictive tool for RHOB.","",""

For training, data must be appropriately valued, and deals with AI companies must be centralized. Companies must clearly define anonymization and consent, and patients must be well-informed about their data usage. Data fed into algorithms must be made AI-ready by refining, purification, digitization and centralization. Finally, data must represent various demographics. AI needs to be safely integrated with radiologists-in-the-loop: guiding forming concepts of AI solutions and supervising training and feedback. To be well-regulated, AI systems must be approved by a health authority and agreements must be made upon liability for errors, roles of supervised and unsupervised AI and fair workforce distribution (between AI and radiologists), with a renewal of policy at regular intervals.

Yet, the explosion of nonstandardized reporting of high-performing algorithms are rendered useless without robust and streamlined implementation guidelines. The development of protocols and checklists will accelerate the translation of research publications to impact on patient care.   RECENT FINDINGS Beyond technological scepticism, we lack uniformity in analysing algorithmic performance generalizability, and benchmarking impacts across clinical settings. No regulatory guardrails have been set to minimize bias or optimize interpretability; no consensus clinical acceptability thresholds or systematized postdeployment monitoring has been set. Moreover, stakeholders with misaligned incentives deepen the landscape complexity especially when it comes to the requisite data integration and harmonization to advance the field. Therefore, despite increasing algorithmic accuracy and commoditization, the infamous 'implementation gap' persists. Open clinical data repositories have been shown to rapidly accelerate research, minimize redundancies and disseminate the expertise and knowledge required to overcome existing barriers. Drawing upon the longstanding success of existing governance frameworks and robust data use and sharing agreements, the ophthalmic community has tremendous opportunity in ushering artificial intelligence into medicine. By collaboratively building a powerful resource of open, anonymized multimodal ophthalmic data, the next generation of clinicians can advance data-driven eye care in unprecedented ways.

It was also observed that there is a reduction in computational complexity, model training times and false alarms. However, there is a significant skewness within the domain. Most studies have focused on intrusion detection and prevention systems, and the most dominant technique used was support vector machines. The findings also revealed that majority of the studies were published in two journal outlets. It is therefore suggested that to enhance research in artificial intelligence for CyberSec, researchers need to adopt newer techniques and also publish in other related outlets.","",""

Stage 3 will be virtual consensus meetings to consolidate and prioritise key items to be included in TRIPOD-AI and PROBAST-AI. Stage 4 will involve developing the TRIPOD-AI checklist and the PROBAST-AI tool, and writing the accompanying explanation and elaboration papers. In the final stage, stage 5, we will disseminate TRIPOD-AI and PROBAST-AI via journals, conferences, blogs, websites (including TRIPOD, PROBAST and EQUATOR Network) and social media.

Specifically, the rotor angle stability has been identified as one of the major obstacle with regards to power electronics dominated power systems. To date, conventional power system stabilizer (PSS) devices are used for damping electromechanical oscillations, which are only tuned sporadically leading to significant deterioration in performance against the ever-changing operating conditions. In this paper, an intelligent power oscillation damper (iPOD) is proposed for grid-forming converters to attenuate electromechanical inter-area power oscillation. In particular, the iPOD is applied to a synchronous power controller (SPC) based grid-forming power converter to increases gain of the active power control loop at the oscillatory frequency. Predictions regarding the mode frequency, corresponding to the current operating points, are given by an artificial intelligence ensemble model called Random Forests. The performance of the proposed controller is verified using the two area system considering symmetrical fault for random operating points. In addition, a comparison with PSS installed in each generator reveals the individual contribution with respect to the inter-area mode damping.","",""

Computing and understanding the properties of such sites is therefore a crucial component of the rational materials design process. Because of complex electronic effects at the atomic level, atomic site properties are conventionally derived from computationally expensive first-principle calculations, as this level of theory is required to achieve relevant accuracy. In this study, we present a widely applicable machine learning (ML) approach to compute atomic site properties with high accuracy in real time. The approach works well for complex non-crystalline atomic structures and therefore opens up the possibility for high-throughput screenings of nano-materials, amorphous systems and materials interfaces. Our approach includes a robust featurization scheme to transform atomic structures into features which can be used by common machine learning models. Performing a genetic algorithm (GA) based feature selection, we show how to establish an intuitive physical interpretation of the structure-property relations implied by the ML models. With this approach, we compute atomic site stabilities of metal nanoparticles ranging from 3-55 atoms with mean absolute errors in the range of 0.11-0.14 eV in real time. We also establish the chemical identity of the site as most important factor in determining atomic site stabilities, followed by structural features like bond distances and angles. Both, the featurization and GA feature selection functionality are published in open-source python modules. With this method, we enable the efficient rational design of highly specialized real-world nano-catalysts through data-driven materials screening.","",""

AI is bringing many benefits to petrophysical evaluation. Using case studies, this paper describes several successful applications. The future of AI has even more potential. However, if used carelessly there are potentially grave consequences. A complex Middle East Carbonate field needed a bespoke shaly water saturation equation. AI was used to ‘evolve’ an ideal equation, together with field specific saturation and cementation exponents. One UKCS gas field had an ‘oil problem’. Here, AI was used to unlock the hidden fluid information in the NMR T1 and T2 spectra and successfully differentiate oil and gas zones in real time. A North Sea field with 30 wells had shear velocity data (Vs) in only 4 wells. Vs was required for reservoir modelling and well bore stability prediction. AI was used to predict Vs in all 30 wells. Incorporating high vertical resolution data, the Vs predictions were even better than the recorded logs. As it is not economic to take core data on every well, AI is used to discover the relationships between logs, core, litho-facies and permeability in multi-dimensional data space. As a consequence, all wells in a field were populated with these data to build a robust reservoir model. In addition, the AI predicted data upscaled correctly unlike many conventional techniques. AI gives impressive results when automatically log quality controlling (LQC) and repairing electrical logs for bad hole and sections of missing data. AI doesn’t require prior knowledge of the petrophysical response equations and is self-calibrating. There are no parameters to pick or cross-plots to make. There is very little user intervention and AI avoids the problem of ‘garbage in, garbage out’ (GIGO), by ignoring noise and outliers. AI programs work with an unlimited number of electrical logs, core and gas chromatography data; and don’t ‘fall-over’ if some of those inputs are missing. AI programs currently being developed include ones where their machine code evolves using similar rules used by life’s DNA code. These AI programs pose considerable dangers far beyond the oil industry as described in this paper. A ‘risk assessment’ is essential on all AI programs so that all hazards and risk factors, that could cause harm, are identified and mitigated.","",""

Moreover, we integrated the cataract AI agent with a real-world multilevel referral pattern involving self-monitoring at home, primary healthcare and specialised hospital services. Results The universal AI platform and multilevel collaborative pattern showed robust diagnostic performance in three-step tasks: (1) capture mode recognition (area under the curve (AUC) 99.28%–99.71%), (2) cataract diagnosis (normal lens, cataract or postoperative eye with AUCs of 99.82%, 99.96% and 99.93% for mydriatic-slit lamp mode and AUCs >99% for other capture modes) and (3) detection of referable cataracts (AUCs >91% in all tests).

The per-exam sensitivity and specificity for detecting CAP in the independent test set was 87% (152 of 175) and 92% (239 of 259), respectively, with an AUC of 0.95 (95% CI: 0.93, 0.97). Conclusions A deep learning model can accurately detect COVID-19 and differentiate it from community acquired pneumonia and other lung diseases.","",""

Here, tailoring ligand chemistry can alter preferred spin or oxidation states as well as electronic structure properties and reactivity, creating vast regions of chemical space to explore when designing new materials atom by atom. Although first-principles density functional theory (DFT) remains the workhorse of computational chemistry in mechanism deduction and property prediction, it is of limited use here. DFT is both far too computationally costly for widespread exploration of transition-metal chemical space and also prone to inaccuracies that limit its predictive performance for localized d electrons in transition-metal complexes. These challenges starkly contrast with the well-trodden regions of small-organic-molecule chemical space, where the analytical forms of molecular mechanics force fields and semiempirical theories have for decades accelerated the discovery of new molecules, accurate DFT functional performance has been demonstrated, and gold-standard methods from correlated wavefunction theory can predict experimental results to chemical accuracy.The combined promise of transition-metal chemical space exploration and lack of established tools has mandated a distinct approach. In this Account, we outline the path we charted in exploration of transition-metal chemical space starting from the first machine learning (ML) models (i.e., artificial neural network and kernel ridge regression) and representations for the prediction of open-shell transition-metal complex properties. The distinct importance of the immediate coordination environment of the metal center as well as the lack of low-level methods to accurately predict structural properties in this coordination environment first motivated and then benefited from these ML models and representations. Once developed, the recipe for prediction of geometric, spin state, and redox potential properties was straightforwardly extended to a diverse range of other properties, including in catalysis, computational ""feasibility"", and the gas separation properties of periodic metal-organic frameworks. Interpretation of selected features most important for model prediction revealed new ways to encapsulate design rules and confirmed that models were robustly mapping essential structure-property relationships. Encountering the special challenge of ensuring that good model performance could generalize to new discovery targets motivated investigation of how to best carry out model uncertainty quantification. Distance-based approaches, whether in model latent space or in carefully engineered feature space, provided intuitive measures of the domain of applicability. With all of these pieces together, ML can be harnessed as an engine to tackle the large-scale exploration of transition-metal chemical space needed to satisfy multiple objectives using efficient global optimization methods. In practical terms, bringing these artificial intelligence tools to bear on the problems of transition-metal chemical space exploration has resulted in ML-model assessments of large, multimillion compound spaces in minutes and validated new design leads in weeks instead of decades.","",""

Through an overview of current trends, we show that many explanations are generated post-hoc and independent of the agent’s logical process, which in turn creates explanations with limited meaning as they lack transparency and fidelity. While user studies are a known basis for evaluating XAI, studies that do not consider objective metrics for evaluating XAI may have limited meaning and may suffer from confirmation bias, particularly if they use low fidelity explanations unnecessarily. To avoid this issue, this paper suggests a paradigm shift in evaluating XAI that focuses on metrics that quantify the explanation itself and its appropriateness given the XAI goal. We suggest four such metrics based on performance differences, D, between the explanation’s logic and the agent’s actual performance, the number of rules, R, outputted by the explanation, the number of features, F , used to generate that explanation, and the stability, S, of the explanation. We believe that user studies that focus on these metrics in their evaluations are inherently more valid and should be integrated in future XAI research.","",""

Surgical correction has proven to be effective in achieving improvement of spinopelvic parameters as well as improving quality of life (QoL) for these patients. However, given the relatively high complication risk associated with ASD correction, it is of paramount importance to develop robust prognostic tools for predicting risk profile and outcomes. Historically, statistical models such as linear and logistic regression models were used to identify preoperative factors associated with postoperative outcomes. While these tools were useful for looking at simple associations, they represent generalizations across large populations, with little applicability to individual patients. More recently, predictive analytics utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) through machine learning for comprehensive processing of large amounts of data have become available for surgeons to implement. The use of these computational techniques has given surgeons the ability to leverage far more accurate and individualized predictive tools to better inform individual patients regarding predicted outcomes after ASD correction surgery. Applications range from predicting QoL measures to predicting the risk of major complications, hospital readmission, and reoperation rates. In addition, AI has been used to create a novel classification system for ASD patients, which will help surgeons identify distinct patient subpopulations with unique risk-benefit profiles. Overall, these tools will help surgeons tailor their clinical practice to address patients’ individual needs and create an opportunity for personalized medicine within spine surgery.","",""

The objective of this paper is to identify current state of the art and application areas of AI in the context of participatory health. Methods : A search was conducted across seven databases (PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsychInfo, ACM Digital Library, IEEExplore, and SCOPUS), covering articles published since 2013. Additionally, clinical trials involving AI in participatory health contexts registered at clinicaltrials.gov were collected and analyzed. Results : Twenty-two articles and 12 trials were selected for review. The most common application of AI in participatory health was the secondary analysis of social media data: self-reported data including patient experiences with healthcare facilities, reports of adverse drug reactions, safety and efficacy concerns about over-the-counter medications, and other perspectives on medications. Other application areas included determining which online forum threads required moderator assistance, identifying users who were likely to drop out from a forum, extracting terms used in an online forum to learn its vocabulary, highlighting contextual information that is missing from online questions and answers, and paraphrasing technical medical terms for consumers. Conclusions : While AI for supporting participatory health is still in its infancy, there are a number of important research priorities that should be considered for the advancement of the field. Further research evaluating the impact of AI in participatory health informatics on the psychosocial wellbeing of individuals would help in facilitating the wider acceptance of AI into the healthcare ecosystem.","",""

However, equivalent model parameters are highly affected from the time-varying composition of power system loads and the stochastic behavior of distributed generators. Thus, equivalent models, developed through in situ measurements, are valid only for the operating conditions from which they have been derived. To overcome this issue, in this paper, a new method is proposed for the derivation of generic aggregated dynamic equivalent models, i.e., for equivalent models that can be used for the dynamic analysis of a wide range of network conditions. The method incorporates clustering and artificial neural network techniques to derive robust sets of parameters for a variable-order dynamic equivalent model. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated using measurements recorded on a laboratory-scale ADN, while its performance is compared with a conventional technique. The corresponding results reveal the applicability of the proposed approach for the analysis and simulation of a wide range of distinct network conditions.","",""

Due to the high complexity of genomic data, AI techniques are increasingly needed to help reduce this and aid the adoption of optimal decisions. Phenotypic prediction is of particular use to drug discovery and precision medicine where sets of genes that predict a given phenotype are determined. Phenotypic prediction is an undetermined problem given that the number of monitored genetic probes markedly exceeds the number of collected samples (from patients). This imbalance creates ambiguity in the characterization of the biological pathways that are responsible for disease development. Areas covered: In this paper, the authors present AI methodologies that perform a robust deep sampling of altered genetic pathways to locate new therapeutic targets, assist in drug repurposing and speed up and optimize the drug selection process. Expert opinion: AI is a potential solution to a number of drug discovery problems, though one should, bear in mind that the quality of data predicts the overall quality of the prediction, as in any modeling task in data science. The use of transparent methodologies is crucial, particularly in drug repositioning/repurposing in rare diseases.","",""
