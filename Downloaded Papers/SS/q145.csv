However, reliability issues would arise due to the characteristics of Non-Volatile Memory synapses operating under the limited size of a neural circuit component called membrane capacitor, resulting in low precision MAC. Through a simulation study, we identified several important criteria of the memory synapses that affect performance of the SNN for the membrane capacitor size of 1pF. (1) The required ON-OFF ratio of synapse needs to be >1000 to preserve classification accuracy. (2) Low on-current Ion (<10uA) is preferred for low power. (3) The variation and error of Ion should be lower than +/- 10% of mean value.","",""

X-ray images, in particular, are utilized in this study to diagnose brain tumors. This paper describes the investigation of the convolutional neural network (CNN) to identify brain tumors from X-ray images. It expedites and increases the reliability of the treatment. Because there has been a significant amount of study in this field, the presented model focuses on boosting accuracy while using a transfer learning strategy. Python and Google Colab were utilized to perform this investigation. Deep feature extraction was accomplished with the help of pretrained deep CNN models, VGG19, InceptionV3, and MobileNetV2. The classification accuracy is used to assess the performance of this paper. MobileNetV2 had the accuracy of 92%, InceptionV3 had the accuracy of 91%, and VGG19 had the accuracy of 88%. MobileNetV2 has offered the highest level of accuracy among these networks. These precisions aid in the early identification of tumors before they produce physical adverse effects such as paralysis and other impairments.","",""

The DP‐RTF refers to the ratio between the direct‐ path acoustic transfer functions of the two microphone channels. First, the complex‐value DP‐RTF is decomposed into the inter‐channel intensity difference, and sinusoidal functions of the inter‐channel phase difference in the time‐frequency domain. Then, the decomposed DP‐RTF features from a series of temporal context frames are utilized to train a DNN model, which maps the DP‐RTF features contaminated by noise and reverberation to the clean ones, and meanwhile provides a time‐frequency (TF) weight to indicate the reliability of the mapping. The DP‐RTF enhancement network can help to enhance the DP‐RTF against noise and reverberation. Finally, the DOA of a sound source can be estimated by integrating the weighted matching between the enhanced DP‐RTF features and the DP‐RTF templates. Experimental results on simulated data show the superiority of the proposed DP‐RTF enhancement network for estimating the DOA of the sound source in the environments with various levels of noise and reverberation.","",""

Uyghur and Kazakh are the languages with derivational morphology, in which words are coined by stems concatenated with suffixes. Usually, terms are used as the representation of text content while excluding functional parts as stop words in these languages. By extracting stems we can collect necessary terms and exclude stop words. Morpheme segmentation tool can split text into morphemes with 95% high reliability.

Recently, deep learning applied to electroencephalogram and electromyogram data has shown great promise as a sleep scoring method, approaching the limits of inter-rater reliability. As with any machine learning algorithm, the inputs to a sleep scoring classifier are typically standardized in order to remove distributional shift caused by variability in the signal collection process. However, in scientific data, experimental manipulations introduce variability that should not be removed. For example, in sleep scoring, the fraction of time spent in each arousal state can vary between control and experimental subjects. We introduce a standardization method, mixture z-scoring, that preserves this crucial form of distributional shift. Using both a simulated experiment and mouse in vivo data, we demonstrate that a common standardization method used by state-of-the-art sleep scoring algorithms introduces systematic bias, but that mixture z-scoring does not. We present a free, open-source user interface that uses a compact neural network and mixture z-scoring to allow for rapid sleep scoring with accuracy that compares well to contemporary methods. This work provides a set of computational tools for the robust automation of sleep scoring.","",""

Often, ANNs with selected architecture are trained with the back-propagation algorithm from few data representatives of the input/output relationship of the underlying model of interest. However, different performing ANNs might be obtained from the same training data, leading to an uncertainty in selecting the best performing ANN. On the other hand, using cross-validation to select the best performing ANN based on the highest R2 value can lead to a biassing in terms of the prediction made by the selected ANN. This is due to the fact that the use of R2 cannot determine if the prediction made by ANN is biased. Additionally, R2 does not indicate if a model is adequate, as it is possible to have a low R2 for a good model and a high R2 for a bad model. Hence we propose an approach to improve the prediction robustness of an ANN based on coupling Bayesian framework and model averaging technique into a unified framework. The model uncertainties propagated to the robust prediction is quantified in terms of confidence intervals. Two examples are used to demonstrate the applicability of the approach.","",""

Here, we design a simulated dataset to study the propensity of neural networks to learn false positive interactions. We find that feature interaction scores obtained from popular neural network architectures trained with multiple random initializations are consistently prone to identifying false positive interactions with large predicted interaction effects, and that previously-proposed null distributions based on the effect size of the interaction scores do not adequately control for false positives even if combining results across different model architectures. Instead, we find that the contribution of an interaction effect to the prediction loss rather than the magnitude of the interaction itself is a far more robust indicator of whether an interaction is likely to be real. Coupled with checking for consistency across different model architectures, our proposed tests based on loss improvement can reliably distinguish between positive and negative controls in our simulated data. To our knowledge, these are the first proposed statistical tests for detecting false positive interactions that leverage improvement in prediction loss on held-out data.

In this paper, a smart, dynamic load priority list will be modeled using artificial neural network (ANN), where different categories of loads such as residential, commercial, industrial and hospital will be prioritized for restoration based on the given time, reliability indices and amount of available energy. The ANN based priority list showed exceptional results in terms of flexibility and understanding of the current energy and reliability status. The results can be further used as an input direct load control functions to intelligently determine which loads should be curtailed and which ones are uninterruptible.","",""

The radar core processor should be operated in a narrowly closed envi- ronment without convection, which will increase the heat sink effect inside the core processor and further affect its reliability and life-time. The AWNNC comprises a wavelet neural network (WNN) controller and a robust compensator. The WNN controller is a principal tracking controller which is utilized to mimic an ideal con- troller; and the parameters of WNN are online tuned by the derived adaptation laws based on the gradient descent method. The robust compensator is designed to dis- pel the approximation error between the ideal controller and the WNN controller, thus the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system can be achieved. Based on National Instruments-PCI extensions for Instrumentation (NI-PXI) system, com- bined the Thermo Electric Cooler (TEC) with a duct heater, active heat dissipation intelligent control system is designed to fix the problem of heat dissipation in long distance in a narrowly closed environment without convection. According to the amount of thermal source and thermal energy, the smart control system can help to adjust the rate of heat dissipation by taking advantage of an adaptive control so that the performance of heat dissipation may be accumulated by its numbers. Last but not least, compared the traditional analog circuit controller with adaptive wavelet neural network controller, the research proves that its proposed active heat dissipation intelligent control system can reach an excellent and accurate temper- ature control. Speaking more precisely, adaptive wavelet neural network controller can be easily adaptive to any environment. It is equipped with a good capability of tracking and searching; and in terms of the effect of temperature control, it never actually jitters due to an input of voltage saturation compared with traditional analog circuit controller.

The pre-processing methods (e.g., random resizing, compression) may lead to the loss of the small lesions feature in the medical image. Retraining the network on the augmented data set is also not practical for medical models that have already been deployed online. Accordingly, it is necessary to design an easy-to-deploy and effective defense framework for medical diagnostic tasks. In this paper, we propose a Robust and Retrain-Less Diagnostic Framework for Medical pretrained models against adversarial attack (i.e., MedRDF). It acts on the inference time of the pretrained medical model. Specifically, for each test image, MedRDF firstly creates a large number of noisy copies of it, and obtains the output labels of these copies from the pretrained medical diagnostic model. Then, based on the labels of these copies, MedRDF outputs the final robust diagnostic result by majority voting. In addition to the diagnostic result, MedRDF produces the Robust Metric (RM) as the confidence of the result. Therefore, it is convenient and reliable to utilize MedRDF to convert pretrained non-robust diagnostic models into robust ones. The experimental results on COVID-19 and DermaMNIST datasets verify the effectiveness of our MedRDF in improving the robustness of medical diagnostic models.","",""

When controlling a PMSM rotor speed, the main control principle is the principle of cascade control with PI-regulators, which includes an external control loop for speed and two internal loops for stator currents along the (d, q)-axes. There are attempts to eliminate the disadvantages of this principle using for the control laws synthesis of modern methods of nonlinear control such methods as linearization feedback, backstepping, predictive control, sliding mode control, methods of robust and adaptive control, fuzzy and neural network control, a combination of these methods etc. However, in most cases, the use of these methods are intended to by means of an appropriate method to synthesize a static or dynamic set points for the standard PI-controllers of rotor speed and currents.

These approaches implement vector control and are not guided by the standard structure of the principle of cascade regulation of PMSM.

Yet, variability in ambient noise, both over time and across sensors, hinders the reliability of current automated systems for sound event detection (SED), such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) in the time-frequency domain. In this article, we develop, benchmark, and combine several machine listening techniques to improve the generalizability of SED models across heterogeneous acoustic environments. As a case study, we consider the problem of detecting avian flight calls from a ten-hour recording of nocturnal bird migration, recorded by a network of six ARUs in the presence of heterogeneous background noise. Starting from a CNN yielding state-of-the-art accuracy on this task, we introduce two noise adaptation techniques, respectively integrating short-term (60 ms) and long-term (30 min) context. First, we apply per-channel energy normalization (PCEN) in the time-frequency domain, which applies short-term automatic gain control to every subband in the mel-frequency spectrogram. Secondly, we replace the last dense layer in the network by a context-adaptive neural network (CA-NN) layer, i.e. an affine layer whose weights are dynamically adapted at prediction time by an auxiliary network taking long-term summary statistics of spectrotemporal features as input. We show that PCEN reduces temporal overfitting across dawn vs. dusk audio clips whereas context adaptation on PCEN-based summary statistics reduces spatial overfitting across sensor locations.

This paper proposes a novel approach based on convolutional neural networks for recovering the lost vibration data for structural health monitoring. The used network is a fully feed‐forward convolutional neural network with bottleneck architecture and skip connection, which constructs the nonlinear relationships between the incomplete signal with data loss measured from the sensors with the transmission loss and the complete true signal. The trained network extracts the robust higher representation features of the measured incomplete signals using the compression layers and expands those features gradually throughout the reconstruction layers to recover and obtain the complete true signals. The long‐term vibration data from Dowling Hall Footbridge are employed to validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach for the lost data recovery. Two case studies are conducted to validate the recovery accuracy for single‐channel and multiple‐channel cases, respectively. The effect of sampling rate on the recovery accuracy is also investigated. The proposed approach exhibits the outstanding capability of lost data recovery, even when the signals have severe data loss ratios up to 90%.

In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning-based acoustic modeling technique which measures and takes account of the reliability using a single DNN. The proposed approach describes the mapping between the noisy input and clean features as a stochastic process. Therefore, a statistical modeling is applied to the DNN-based acoustic model in predicting the posterior distribution of the clean speech features given a distorted input data. Also, by attempting the two different probabilistic models in clean feature distribution assumption, we investigate which distribution is more proper on various environment conditions.

The estimation precision is enhanced by introducing a low pass filter with the wavelet analysis against rapidly varying noises, and an autoassociative neural network which takes charge of the correction of only gradually varying noises. The modified multivariate stratification sampling using the concept of time stratification and MAXIMIN criteria is developed to overcome the shortcoming of a general random sampling.

A problem of particular interest to the guidance literature is the closed-loop optical solutions that can be achieved on-board the missile. Furthermore, a desirable guidance scheme should be robust to low signal-to-noise conditions that generally arise in long-range applications. In this paper we shall present a neural network- based guidance scheme which provides a real-time optimal control on-board the missile with the inclusion of noise in the LOS angular rate data. The neural network is trained in an off-line session using optimal solutions obtained from an optimal control software resulting in a real- time closed-loop guidance method. The performance of the proposed scheme is then evaluated for different levels of SNR of the Line-Of-Sight (LOS) angular rate in a tail-chase engagement. In doing so, similar tests were conducted for the currently used closed-loop proportional navigation method and the potentially available technique of iterative optimal open-loop control with and without the presence of noise in the LOS angular rate. Although we did not include the noise in the missile/target dynamical model, the results indicate that the neural network-based scheme shows more robustness to low signal-to-noise situations as compared with traditional proportional navigation methods. This superiority is due, among other things, to the elimination of some of the restrictive, and in many cases unrealistic assumptions made in the derivation of most current guidance laws in use such as, for instance, unbounded control, simplified dynamics and/or aerodynamics, and non-maneuvering targets, to name a few.","",""

Testing methods and results are presented on networks for which computation time is a fraction of the necessary with traditional methods, yet classification reliability is maintained.

Indeed, it is hard to provide efficient approaches that are able to handle with the inherent uncertainty of prognostics and nobody is able to a priori ensure that an accurate prognostic model can be built. As for an example of remaining problems, consider data-driven prognostics approaches: how to ensure that a model will be able to face with inputs variation with respect to those ones that have been learned, how to ensure that a learned-model will face with unknown data, how to ensure convergence of algorithms, etc. In other words, robustness, reliability and applicability of a prognostic approach are still open areas. Following that, the aim of this paper is to address these challenges by proposing a new neural network (structure and algorithm) that enhances reliability of RUL estimates while improving applicability of the approach. Robustness, reliability and applicability aspects are first discussed and defined according to literature. On this basis, a new connexionist system is proposed for prognostics: the Improved-Extreme Learning machine (Imp-ELM). This neural network, based on complex activation functions, enables to reduce the influence of human choices and initial parameterization, while improving accuracy of estimates and speeding the learning phase. The whole proposition is illustrated by performing tests on a real industrial case of cutting tools from a Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machine. This is achieved by predicting tool condition (wear) in terms of remaining cuts successfully made. Thorough comparisons with adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and existing ELM algorithm are also given. Results show improved robustness, reliability and applicability performances.","",""

To investigate the effectiveness of diversity, many scholars have a focus on the reliability and quality of meta-heuristic algorithms for enhancement. To initialize the population in the search space, this dissertation proposes three new low discrepancy sequences for population initialization instead of uniform distribution called the WELL sequence, Knuth sequence, and Torus sequence. This paper also introduces a detailed survey of the different initialization methods of PSO and DE based on quasi-random sequence families such as the Sobol sequence, Halton sequence, and uniform random distribution. For well-known benchmark test problems and learning of artificial neural network, the proposed methods for PSO (TO-PSO, KN-PSO, and WE-PSO), BA (BA-TO, BA-WE, and BA-KN), and DE (DE-TO, DE-WE, and DE-KN) have been evaluated. The synthesis of our strategies demonstrates promising success over uniform random numbers using low discrepancy sequences. The experimental findings indicate that the initialization based on low discrepancy sequences is exceptionally stronger than the uniform random number. Furthermore, our work outlines the profound effects on convergence and heterogeneity of the proposed methodology.

The key challenge stems from how to ensure the added perturbation of the original audio in advance at the sender side is immune to unknown signal distortions during the transmission process. Our empirical study reveals that signal distortion is mainly due to device and channel frequency selectivity but with different characteristics. This brings a chance to capture and further pre-code this impact to generate adversarial examples that are robust to the over-the-air transmission. We leverage this opportunity in Metamorph and obtain an initial perturbation that captures the core distortion’s impact from only a small set of prior measurements, and then take advantage of a domain adaptation algorithm to refine the perturbation to further improve the attack distance and reliability. Moreover, we consider also reducing human perceptibility of the added perturbation. Evaluation achieves a high attack success rate (90%) over the attack distance of up to 6 m. Within a moderate distance, e.g., 3 m, Metamorph maintains this high success rate, yet can be further adapted to largely improve the audio quality, confirmed by a human perceptibility study.","",""

The proposed model can employ a set of real-time sensor measurements to: 1) diagnose the hidden degradation level of the system and 2) predict the likelihood and the uncertainty of failure without imposing unrealistic heavy distributional assumptions. We provide analytical results for the prediction and update steps of the associated particle filter, as well as for the estimation of model parameters.

To predict bearing remaining useful life (RUL), the abilities of statistical characteristics to reflect the bearing degradation state differ, and the single prediction model has low generalization ability and a poor prediction effect. An ensemble robust prediction method is proposed here to predict bearing RUL based on the construction of a bearing degradation indicator set: the initial bearing degradation indicator subsets were constructed using the Fast Correlation-Based Filter with Approximate Markov Blankets (FCBF-AMB) and Maximal Information Coefficient (MIC) selection methods. Through the cross-operation of the obtained subsets, we obtained a set of robust degradation indicators. These selected degradation indicators were fed into the long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network prediction model enhanced by the AdaBoost algorithm. We found through calculation that the average prediction accuracy of the proposed method is 91.40%, 92.04%, and 93.25% at 2100, 2250, and 2400 rpm, respectively. Compared with other methods, the proposed method improves the prediction accuracy by 1.8% to 14.87% at most. Therefore, the method proposed in this paper is more accurate than the other methods in terms of RUL prediction.","",""

As a consequence, much attention has been given to the motor torque and speed control. The control schemes available today require information regarding speed of the motor, which can either be obtained by using speed sensors or without speed sensors. Speed sensors have several disadvantages from the standpoint of drive cost, reliability, inertia and noise immunity. Advantages of eliminating speed sensors thus have been a strong motivation to develop speed sensor less induction motor drives for industrial drives. Several control strategies of sensor less control are available in literature. This paper is an attempt to explore the possibility of estimation of rotor speed with the help of extended Kalman filter trained recurrent Neural Network. The speed estimation is made robust by simultaneously adapting the rotor resistance and rotor flux which are also done by the same Neural Network. The training is very fast as it requires only one iteration. The proposed scheme is studied on an induction motor and it gives better performance as compared to the already existing algorithms in the literature.","",""

An adaptive WACS has been designed to provide damping control signals to the excitations of generators. The delays in signal transmission and the reliability of the communication network is a major concern with wide-area measurement- based control. The adaptive WACS is designed to compensate for a wide range of communication delays and provide robust damping to mitigate system oscillations. A single simultaneous recurrent neural network is used in the realisation of the adaptive WACS for both identification and control of the power system. The WACS has been implemented on a digital signal processor and its performance is evaluated on a power system implemented on a real-time platform - the real-time digital simulator. The additional damping provided by the WACS is enumerated using Prony analysis.","",""

Both position and speed loops are monitored by a single Sugeno fuzzy controller. The fuzzy solution is analyzed comparatively with the standard structure that generated it by training the neural network. Different training conditions are taken into account. The influence of the motor parameters, load characteristics, reference value and tuning parameters are considered. The proposed solution is simple and ensures a good and robust behavior.","",""

Therefore, it is worth while to get rid of the outliers from experimental data during the calculation to ensure the reliability and precision of the system. Based on the Radial Basis Function neural network and the law of cross validation, this paper presents an iterative regressing method in consideration of the existence of outliers. Cross validation is repeatedly used for random sampling the experimental data as the training data set, with which RBF neural network can complete the regressing. By repeating such procedure and updating the estimated parameters, the training data set and system function of multi-functional sensor can be optimized. Accordingly, the reconstruction of any signals can be accomplished with the selected model. The theoretic analysis and the experimental results show that the approach is effective, robust and practicable.","",""
