English knowledge base is obviously larger and of higher quality than low resource language like Chinese. To expand Chinese KB by leveraging English KB resources, an effective way is to translate English KB (source) into Chinese (target). In this direction, two major challenges are to model triple semantics and to build a robust KB translator. We address these challenges by presenting a neural network approach, which learns continuous triple representation with a gated neural network. Accordingly, source triples and target triples are mapped in the same semantic vector space. We build a new dataset for English-Chinese KB translation from Freebase, and compare with several baselines on it. Experimental results show that the proposed method improves translation accuracy compared with baseline methods. We show that adaptive composition model improves standard solution such as neural tensor network in terms of translation accuracy.","",""

We analytically prove that our LS-type deep channel estimator can approach minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator performance for high-dimensional signals, while avoiding complex channel inversions and knowledge of the channel covariance matrix. This analytical result, while asymptotic, is observed in simulations to be operational for just 64 antennas and 64 subcarriers per OFDM symbol. The proposed method also does not require any training and utilizes several orders of magnitude fewer parameters than conventional DNNs. The proposed deep channel estimator is also robust to pilot contamination and can even completely eliminate it under certain conditions.","",""

Knowledge units often contain semantically relevant knowledge, and thus linkable for different purposes, such as duplicate questions, directly linkable for problem solving, indirectly linkable for related information. Recognising different classes of linkable knowledge would support more targeted information needs when users search or explore the knowledge base. Existing methods focus on binary relatedness (i.e., related or not), and are not robust to recognize different classes of semantic relatedness when linkable knowledge units share few words in common (i.e., have lexical gap). In this paper, we formulate the problem of predicting semantically linkable knowledge units as a multiclass classification problem, and solve the problem using deep learning techniques. To overcome the lexical gap issue, we adopt neural language model (word embeddings) and convolutional neural network (CNN) to capture word- and document-level semantics of knowledge units. Instead of using human-engineered classifier features which are hard to design for informal user-generated content, we exploit large amounts of different types of user-created knowledge-unit links to train the CNN to learn the most informative wordlevel and document-level features for the multiclass classification task. Our evaluation shows that our deep-learning based approach significantly and consistently outperforms traditional methods using traditional word representations and human-engineered classifier features.","",""

The underlying principles of human motion provide inspiration for robotics. Pointing at different targets is a common robotics task, where insights about human motion can be applied. Traditionally in robotics, when a motion is generated it has to be validated so that the robot configurations involved are appropriate. The human brain, in contrast, uses the motor cortex to generate new motions reusing and combining existing knowledge before executing the motion. We propose a method to generate and control pointing motions for a robot using a biological inspired architecture implemented with spiking neural networks. We outline a simplified model of the human motor cortex that generates motions using motor primitives. The network learns a base motor primitive for pointing at a target in the center, and four correction primitives to point at targets up, down, left and right from the base primitive, respectively. The primitives are combined to reach different targets. We evaluate the performance of the network with a humanoid robot pointing at different targets marked on a plane. The network was able to combine one, two or three motor primitives at the same time to control the robot in real-time to reach a specific target. We work on extending this work from pointing to a given target to performing a grasping or tool manipulation task.

ANNs have demonstrated good predictive performance in a wide variety of practical problems. However, there are strong arguments as to why ANNs are not sufficient for the general representation of knowledge. The arguments are the poor comprehensibility of the learned ANN, and the inability to represent explanation structures.    The overall objective of this thesis is to address these issues by: (1) explanation of the decision process in ANNs in the form of symbolic rules (predicate rules with variables); and (2) provision of explanatory capability by mapping the general conceptual knowledge that is learned by the neural networks into a knowledge base to be used in a rule-based reasoning system.    A multi-stage methodology GYAN is developed and evaluated for the task of extracting knowledge from the trained ANNs. The extracted knowledge is represented in the form of restricted first-order logic rules, and subsequently allows user interaction by interfacing with a knowledge based reasoner. The performance of GYAN is demonstrated using a number of real world and artificial data sets. The empirical results demonstrate that: (1) an equivalent symbolic interpretation is derived describing the overall behaviour of the ANN with high accuracy and fidelity, and (2) a concise explanation is given (in terms of rules, facts and predicates activated in a reasoning episode) as to why a particular instance is being classified into a certain category.","",""

After introducing relevant terminology and the goals and range of possible knowledge of both attackers and defenders, we survey recent work on test-time evasion (TTE), data poisoning (DP), backdoor DP, and reverse engineering (RE) attacks and particularly defenses against the same. In so doing, we distinguish robust classification from anomaly detection (AD), unsupervised from supervised, and statistical hypothesis-based defenses from ones that do not have an explicit null (no attack) hypothesis. We also consider several scenarios for detecting backdoors. We provide a technical assessment for reviewed works, including identifying any issues/limitations, required hyperparameters, needed computational complexity, as well as the performance measures evaluated and the obtained quality. We then delve deeper, providing novel insights that challenge conventional AL wisdom and that target unresolved issues, including: robust classification versus AD as a defense strategy; the belief that attack success increases with attack strength, which ignores susceptibility to AD; small perturbations for TTE attacks: a fallacy or a requirement; validity of the universal assumption that a TTE attacker knows the ground-truth class for the example to be attacked; black, gray, or white-box attacks as the standard for defense evaluation; and susceptibility of query-based RE to an AD defense. We also discuss attacks on the privacy of training data. We then present benchmark comparisons of several defenses against TTE, RE, and backdoor DP attacks on images.

However, most existing deep learning based approaches in neuroimaging do not investigate the specific difficulties that exist in segmenting extremely small but important brain regions such as the subnuclei of the amygdala. To tackle this challenging task, we developed a dual-branch dilated residual 3D fully convolutional network with parallel convolutions to extract more global context and alleviate the class imbalance issue by maintaining a small receptive field that is just the size of the regions of interest (ROIs). We also conduct multi-scale feature fusion in both parallel and series to compensate the potential information loss during convolutions, which has been shown to be important for small objects. The serial feature fusion enabled by residual connections is further enhanced by a proposed top-down attention-guided refinement unit, where the high-resolution low-level spatial details are selectively integrated to complement the high-level but coarse semantic information, enriching the final feature representations. As a result, the segmentations resulting from our method are more accurate both volumetrically and morphologically, compared with other deep learning based approaches. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first deep learning-based approach that targets the subregions of the amygdala.

Recently, more accurate and robust medical knowledge-guided methods have been proposed and have achieved superior performance. These methods inject the knowledge from a graph structure medical ontology into deep models via attention mechanisms to provide supplementary information of the input data.

Our proposed method can automatically detect a fence and generate a clean image without any user input.

These architectures enable faster inferences and could bring DNNs to low-power devices, e.g. in the Internet of Things (IoT). However, it is unknown if the computational savings provided by this approach are robust against adversarial pressure. In particular, an adversary may aim to slow down adaptive DNNs by increasing their average inference time$-$a threat analogous to the $denial$-$of$-$service$ attacks from the Internet. In this paper, we conduct a systematic evaluation of this threat by experimenting with three generic multi-exit DNNs (based on VGG16, MobileNet, and ResNet56) and a custom multi-exit architecture, on two popular image classification benchmarks (CIFAR-10 and Tiny ImageNet).

In this article, we propose an automatic and robust framework for the dermoscopic SLC named Dermoscopic Expert (DermoExpert). The DermoExpert consists of a preprocessing, a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (hybrid-CNN), and transfer learning. The proposed hybrid-CNN classifier consists of three distinct feature extractors, with the same input images, which are fused to achieve better-depth feature maps of the corresponding lesion. Those distinct and fused feature maps are classified using the different fully connected layers, which are then ensembled to get a final prediction probability. In the preprocessing, we use lesion segmentation, augmentation, and class rebalancing. For boosting the lesion recognition, we have also employed geometric and intensity-based augmentation as well as the class rebalancing by penalizing the loss of the majority class and adding extra images to the minority classes. Additionally, we leverage the knowledge from a pre-trained model, also known as transfer learning, to build a generic classifier, although small datasets are being used. In the end, we design and implement a web application by deploying the weights of our DermoExpert for automatic lesion recognition. We evaluate our DermoExpert on the ISIC-2016, ISIC-2017, and ISIC-2018 datasets, where our DermoExpert has achieved the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.96, 0.95, and 0.97, respectively. The experimental results outperform the recent state-of-the-art by a margin of 10.0 % and 2.0 % respectively for ISIC-2016 and ISIC-2017 datasets in terms of AUC. The DermoExpert also outperforms, in concerning a balanced accuracy, by a margin of 3.0 % for ISIC-2018 dataset. Since our framework can provide better-classification on three different test datasets, even with limited training data, it can lead to better-recognition of melanoma to aid dermatologists. Our source code, and segmented masks, for ISIC-2018 dataset, will be made publicly available for the research community for further improvements.","",""

A layer named the frame gate is designed to integrate weighted semantic information on multiple frames to remove redundant and meaningless signal frames. A triple-net structure is introduced to distill the learned features net by net to replace the hand-engineered features with professional knowledge. Specifically, one neural network is normally trained for several epochs.

However, it is a challenge yet, due to added noise, artifacts, limitations, and unclear edges [8].

Colon segmentation techniques can also be used in colorectal tissues simulations to make preoperative plans and simulations of surgery [4]. Some colon segmentation algorithms are introduced in literature, each one having its own model, computational complexity, and overall quality. Such as Local region based active contours [6], which is based on local statistics of tissue of interest and background, instead of global statistics. In [15], an isotropic volume reconstructed from the CT images is used to extract a thick region encompassing the entire colon, where mean curvature, dimensionless ratio sphericity and minimum polyp size are used as parameters to filter anomalies and reduce false positives. Classifications of multispectral colorectal cancer tissues [5], classify tissues samples using convolutional neural network (CNN) and uses active contours technique to extract colorectal regions corresponding to pathological tissues. Although some works presented in literature have demonstrated how CNN provides effective results to analyze colon images, those works are based on the segmentation image regions containing pathological colorectal tissues [5],[7], and glandular colon structure [10]. On the contrary, the analysis of colon tissues as pre-processing task for applications, as tissues simulations, is our motivation to challenge the use of pixel-wise segmentation with CNN.

Compared to conventional machine learning (ML) methods, a CNN can self-learn useful features from the input data and does not perform complex manual feature engineering (i.e., feature extraction and selection). Results: Finally, according to the optimization experiment, the CNN model obtained the average performance using optimal configuration across 10-fold: accuracy = 98.69%, sensitivity = 99.29%, specificity = 98.10%, and area under the curve = 98.70%. Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this approached achieved better classification performance in predicting fetal hypoxia using FHR signals compared to the other state-of-the-art works. Significance: In summary, the satisfied result proved the effectiveness of our proposed CAD system for assisting obstetricians making objective and accurate medical decisions based on RP and powerful CNN algorithm.","",""

First, a neural network based fault estimation is designed to online approximate the unknown uncertainties and faults. The estimated uncertainty and fault information are then used to compensate in advance for the effects of uncertainties in fault-free operation and both uncertainties and faults in fault operation. To eliminate the neural network compensation error, QC2S with adaptation gain, named as adaptive QC2S (AQC2S), is proposed. By integrating the advantages of the neural network observer and the AQC2S controller, the integrated scheme has a good capability to accommodate both the uncertainties and faults with chattering-free, higher position tracking accuracy, and no requirement of prior knowledge of the fault information.

One of the open issues in hand-vein verification is the lack of robustness against image quality degradation, which may comprise the verification accuracy. To achieve robust verification, vein feature extraction approaches, especially vein texture segmentation, have been extensively investigated. In recent years, deep neural networks have achieved promising results in medical image segmentation and have been brought into vein verification, but current solutions suffer from two challenges for vein segmentation: 1) lacking the labeling data, which is expensive to obtain and 2) the incorrect label data obtained by manual labeling scheme or automatic labeling scheme may strongly influence parameters when the network is trained, which may degrade the verification performance. This paper proposes an iterative deep belief network (DBN) to extract vein features based on the initial label data, which are automatically generated using a very limited a priori knowledge and iteratively corrected by our DBN. First, a known handcrafted vein image segmentation technique is employed to automatically label vein pixel and background pixel. A training dataset is constructed based on the patches centered on the labeled pixels. Second, a DBN is trained on the resulting database to predict the probability of each pixel to belong to be a vein pixel given a patch centered on it. The vein patterns are segmented using a probability threshold of 0.5. The resulting vein features are employed to reconstruct the training dataset, based on which the network is retrained. During the iterative procedure, the incorrect labels of training data are statistically corrected, which enables DBN to effectively learn what a finger-vein pattern is by learning the difference between vein patterns and background ones. The experimental results on two public hand-vein databases show a significant improvement in terms of hand-vein verification accuracy.","",""

Since obtaining satellite imagery or aerial imagery is getting more ease in recent years, landslide detection and flood detection is highly in demand.

The automatic method is able to detect the damaged building by extracting the defect features. However, various design methods and widely changing real-world conditions, such as shadow and light changes, cause challenges to the extensive appointing of automatic methods. As a potential solution for such challenges, this research proposes the adaption of deep learning (DL), specifically convolutional neural networks (CNN), which has a high ability to learn features automatically, to identify damaged buildings from pre- and post-event RS imageries.

Thus, a more efficient use of the radio spectrum is required. A smart antenna system is capable of efficiently utilizing the radio spectrum and is a promise for an effective solution to the present wireless system problems while achieving reliable and robust high-speed, high-data-rate transmission. Smart antenna technology offer significantly improved solution to reduce interference level and improve system capacity. With this technology, each user’s signal is transmitted and received by the base station only in the direction of that particular user. Smart antenna technology attempts to address this problem via advanced signal processing technology called beamforming.  The adaptive algorithm used in the signal processing has a profound effect on the performance of a Smart Antenna system that is known to have resolution and interference rejection capability when array steering vector is precisely known. Adaptive beamforming is used for enhancing a desired signal while suppressing noise and interference at the output of an array of sensors. However the performance degradation of adaptive beamforming may become more pronounced than in an ideal case because some of underlying assumptions on environment, sources or sensor array can be violated and this may cause mismatch. There are several efficient approaches that provide an improved robustness against mismatch as like LSMI algorithm.   Neural network is a massively parallel distributed processor made up of simple processing units, which has a natural propensity for storing experimental knowledge and making it available for use. Neural network methods possess such advantages as general purpose nature, nonlinear property, passive parallelism, adaptive learning capability, generalization capability and fast convergence rates. Motivated by these inherent advantages of the neural network, in this thesis work, a robust adaptive beamforming algorithm using neural network is investigated which is effective in case of signal steering vector mismatch. This technique employs a three-layer radial basis function neural network (RBFNN), which treats the problem of computing the weights of an adaptive array antenna as a mapping problem. The robust adaptive beamforming algorithm using RBFNN, provides excellent robustness to signal steering vector mismatches, enhances the array system performance under non ideal conditions and makes the mean output array SINR (Signal-to-Interference-plus- Noise Ratio) consistently close to the optimal one.","",""

This paper addresses this issue by proposing a novel framework for the binaural sound localization that combines the model-based information about the spectral characteristics of sound sources and deep neural networks (DNNs). A target source model and a background source model are first estimated during a training phase using spectral features extracted from sound signals in isolation. When the identity of the background source is not available, a universal background model can be used. During testing, the source models are used jointly to explain the mixed observations and improve the localization process by selectively weighting source azimuth posteriors output by a DNN-based localization system. To address the possible mismatch between the training and testing, a model adaptation process is further employed the on-the-fly during testing, which adapts the background model parameters directly from the noisy observations in an iterative manner. The proposed system, therefore, combines the model-based and data-driven information flow within a single computational framework.

The proposed model not only learns sufficient knowledge from the limited number of samples, but also has powerful generalization ability. The proposed framework based on three-dimensional convolution can extract spectral-spatial features of labeled samples effectively. Though CNN has shown its robustness to distortion, it cannot extract features of different scales through the traditional pooling layer that only have one size of pooling window. Hence, spatial pyramid pooling (SPP) is introduced into three-dimensional local convolutional filters for hyperspectral classification. Experimental results with a widely used hyperspectral remote sensing dataset show that the proposed model provides competitive performance.","",""

In many applications, feed-forward neural networks are heavily involved in the implementation of controllers by learning and representing control laws through several methods such as model predictive control (MPC) and reinforcement learning (RL). The type of networks that we consider in this manuscript are feed-forward neural networks consisting of multiple hidden layers with ReLU activation functions and a linear activation function in the output layer. While neural network controllers have been able to achieve desirable performance in many contexts, they also present a unique challenge in that it is difficult to provide any guarantees about the correctness of their behavior or reason about the stability a system that employs their use. Thus, from a controls perspective, it is necessary to verify them in conjunction with their corresponding plants in closed-loop. While there have been a handful of works proposed towards the verification of closed-loop systems with feed-forward neural network controllers, this area still lacks attention and a unified set of benchmark examples on which verification techniques can be evaluated and compared. Thus, to this end, we present a range of closed-loop control systems ranging from two to six state variables, and a range of controllers with sizes in the range of eleven neurons to a few hundred neurons in more complex systems.

In recent years, advances in Artficial Intelligence (AI) have enabled a diverse range of technologies that are directly impacting people’s everyday lives [16]. Particularly, within this space, machine learning methods such as Deep Learning (DL) have achieved levels of accuracy and performance that are competitive or better than humans for tasks such as pattern and image recognition [12], natural language processing [7], and knowledge representation and reasoning [15,22]. Despite these achievements, there have been reservations about incorporating them into safety critical systems [11] due to their susceptibility to unexpected and errant behavior from a slight perturbation in their inputs [18]. Furthermore, neural networks are often viewed as ""black boxes"" since the underlying operation of the neuron activations is often indiscernible [22]. In light of these challenges, there has been significant work towards the creation of methods and verification tools that can formally reason about the behavior of neural networks [22]. However, the vast majority of these techniques have only been able to deal with feed-forward neural networks with piecewise-linear activation functions [4]. Additionally, the bulk of these methods have primarily considered the verification of input-output properties of neural networks in isolation [22], and there are only a handful of works that have explicitly addressed the verification of closed-loop control systems with neural network controllers [5, 8, 19–21]. One of the central challenges in verifying neural network control systems is that applying existing methodology to these systems is not straightforward [9], and a simple combination of verification tools for non-linear ordinary differential equations along with a neural network reachability tool suffers from severe overestimation errors [5]. Still, the verification of closed loop neural network systems is deeply important as they naturally arise in safety critical systems [5] such as autonomous vehicles, and complex control systems that make use of model predictive control and reinforcement learning [16]. Thus, there is a compelling need for methods and advanced software tools that can effectively deal with the complexities exhibited by these systems [5]. Inspired by a shortage of verification methods for closed-loop neural network control systems in the research literature, the central contribution of this paper is the provision of a set of executable benchmarks that have been synthesized using methods such as reinforcement learning [17], and model predictive control [14]. The problems elucidated in the paper are modeled using Simulink/Stateflow (SLSF) and are available at the following github repository1. We aim to provide a thorough problem description to which the numerous tools and approaches for non-linear systems and neural network verification present in the research community can be evaluated and compared [22]. If the research community is able to devise acceptable solutions to the aformentioned challenges they will stimulate the development of robust and intelligent systems with the potential to bring unparalleled benefits to numerous application domains. 2 Description of benchmarks.

The buildings HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) systems, whose functionality is to maintain thermal comfort and indoor air quality (IAQ), account for almost half of the energy consumed by the buildings. Thus, intelligent scheduling of the building HVAC system has the potential for tremendous energy and cost savings while ensuring that the control objectives (thermal comfort, air quality) are satisfied. Traditionally, rule-based and model-based approaches such as linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) have been used for scheduling HVAC. However, the system complexity of HVAC and the dynamism in the building environment limit the accuracy, efficiency and robustness of such methods. Recently, several works have focused on model-free deep reinforcement learning based techniques such as Deep Q-Network (DQN). Such methods require extensive interactions with the environment. Thus, they are impractical to implement in real systems due to low sample efficiency. Safety-aware exploration is another challenge in real systems since certain actions at particular states may result in catastrophic outcomes. To address these issues and challenges, we propose a modelbased reinforcement learning approach that learns the system dynamics using a neural network. Then, we adopt Model Predictive Control (MPC) using the learned system dynamics to perform control with random-sampling shooting method. To ensure safe exploration, we limit the actions within safe range and the maximum absolute change of actions according to prior knowledge. We evaluate our ideas through simulation using widely adopted EnergyPlus tool on a case study consisting of a two zone data-center. Experiments show that the average deviation of the trajectories sampled from the learned dynamics and the ground truth is below 20%. Compared with baseline approaches, we reduce the total energy consumption by 17.1% ~ 21.8%.

In contrast to other tuning techniques such as Ziegler– Nichols or genetic algorithms (GA), our proposal allows a real-time adjustment of the tuning parameters according to the network conditions. Thus, the new algorithm provides an online control of the tuning process unlike the ZN and GA techniques, whose tuning parameters are calculated offline. The algorithm, called neural network service level PID (NNSPID), guarantees minimum bandwidth levels to users depending on their service level agreement, and it is compared with a tuning technique based on genetic algorithms (GASPID). The simulation study demonstrates that NN-SPID continuously adapts the tuning parameters, achieving lower fluctuations than GA-SPID in the allocation process. As a consequence, it provides a more stable response than GA-SPID since it needs to launch the GA to obtain new tuning values. Furthermore, NN-SPID guarantees the minimum bandwidth levels faster than GA-SPID. Finally, NN-SPID is more robust than GA-SPID under real-time changes of the guaranteed bandwidth levels, as GA-SPID shows high fluctuations in the allocated bandwidth, especially just after any change is made.","",""

However, such framework suffers from adversarial attacks which confuse neural networks via adding quasi-imperceptible noises to input images without changing the ground truth annotated by human subjects.

Furthermore, this paper proposes a novel end-to-end trainable framework to enhance the robustness for arbitrary FCN-based salient object detection models against adversarial attacks. The proposed framework adopts a novel idea that first introduces some new generic noise to destroy adversarial perturbations, and then learns to predict saliency maps for input images with the introduced noise. Specifically, our proposed method consists of a segment-wise shielding component, which preserves boundaries and destroys delicate adversarial noise patterns and a context-aware restoration component, which refines saliency maps through global contrast modeling.

Toward their extensive uptake, this paper presents a universally interpretable machine learning (UIML) framework for turbulence modeling, which consists of two parallel machine learning-based modules to directly infer the structural and parametric representations of turbulence physics, respectively. At each phase of model development, data reflecting the evolution dynamics of turbulence and domain knowledge representing prior physical considerations are converted into modeling knowledge. The data- and knowledge-driven UIML is investigated with a deep residual network. The following three aspects are demonstrated in detail: (i) a compact input feature parameterizing a new turbulent timescale is introduced to prevent nonunique mappings between conventional input arguments and output Reynolds stress; (ii) a realizability limiter is developed to overcome the under-constrained state of modeled stress; and (iii) fairness and noise-insensitivity constraints are included in the training procedure. Consequently, an invariant, realizable, unbiased, and robust data-driven turbulence model is achieved. The influences of the training dataset size, activation function, and network hyperparameter on the performance are also investigated. The resulting model exhibits good generalization across two- and three-dimensional flows, and captures the effects of the Reynolds number and aspect ratio.

Then, the obtained optimal profile is used as set points of the proposed control strategies for improving the crystal product quality. The performances and robustness of the proposed controllers are evaluated in several cases such as for set point tracking and plant/model mismatches. Simulation results show that the neural network-based model predictive control gives the best control performance among the inverse neural network control and a conventional PID controller in all cases.","",""

With few exceptions, the robustness issue is not addressed. In practical implementation of exactly linearising control laws, the chief drawback is that they are based on exact cancellation of non-linear terms. If there is any uncertainty in the knowledge of the non-linear functions, the cancellation is not exact and the resulting inputoutput equation is not linear.

To begin with, the event-triggered robust nonlinear control problem is transformed into an event-triggered nonlinear optimal control problem by introducing an infinite-horizon integral cost for the nominal system. Then, a recurrent neural network (RNN) and adaptive critic designs (ACDs) are employed to solve the derived event-triggered nonlinear optimal control problem. The RNN is applied to reconstruct the system dynamics based on collected system data. After acquiring the knowledge of system dynamics, a unique critic network is proposed to obtain the approximate solution of the event-triggered Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation within the framework of ACDs. The critic network is updated by using simultaneously historical and instantaneous state data. An advantage of the present critic network update law is that it can relax the persistence of excitation condition. Meanwhile, under a newly developed event-triggering condition, the proposed critic network tuning rule not only guarantees the critic network weights to converge to optimums but also ensures nominal system states to be uniformly ultimately bounded. Moreover, by using Lyapunov method, it is proved that the derived optimal event-triggered control (ETC) guarantees uniform ultimate boundedness of all the signals in the original system. Finally, a nonlinear oscillator and an unstable power system are provided to validate the developed robust ETC scheme.","",""

METHODS A 3D Convolutional Neural Network was trained for automatic bladder segmentation of the CT scans. The automatic bladder segmentation alongside the CT scan are jointly optimized to add explicit knowledge about the underlying anatomy to the registration algorithm. We included three datasets from different institutes and CT manufacturers. The first was used for training and testing the ConvNet, where the second and the third were used for evaluation of the proposed pipeline. The system performance was quantified geometrically using the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), the Mean Surface Distance (MSD), and the 95% Hausdorff Distance (HD). The propagated contours were validated clinically through generating the associated IMPT plans and compare it with the IMPT plans based on the manual delineations. Propagated contours were considered clinically acceptable if their treatment plans met the dosimetric coverage constraints on the manual contours.   RESULTS The bladder segmentation network achieved a DSC of 88% and 82% on the test datasets. The proposed registration pipeline achieved a MSD of 1:29±0:39, 1:48±1:16, and 1:49±0:44 mm for the prostate, seminal vesicles, and lymph nodes, respectively on the second dataset and a MSD of 2:31 ± 1:92 and 1:76 ± 1:39 mm for the prostate and seminal vesicles on the third dataset. The automatically propagated contours met the dose coverage constraints in 86%, 91%, and 99% of the cases for the prostate, seminal vesicles, and lymph nodes, respectively. A Conservative Success Rate (CSR) of 80% was obtained, compared to 65% when only using intensity-based registration.   CONCLUSION The proposed registration pipeline obtained highly promising results for generating treatment plans adapted to the daily anatomy. With 80% of the automatically generated treatment plans directly usable without manual correction, a substantial improvement in system robustness was reached compared to a previous approach. The proposed method therefore facilitates more precise proton therapy of prostate cancer, potentially leading to fewer treatment related adverse side effects. This article is protected by copyright.

Recent work applies encoder-decoder models to tackle this problem, where an encoder is formulated as a graph neural network (GNN) and a decoder is represented by an embedding method. These approaches enforce embedding techniques with structure information. Unfortunately, existing GNN-based frameworks still confront 3 severe problems: low representational power, stacking in a flat way, and poor robustness to noise. In this work, we propose a novel multi-level graph neural network (M-GNN) to address the above challenges.

Then, we define graph coarsening schemes for various kinds of relations, and stack GNN layers on a series of coarsened graphs, so as to model hierarchical structures. Furthermore, attention mechanisms are adopted so that our approach can make predictions accurately even on the noisy knowledge graph. Results on WN18 and FB15k datasets show that our approach is effective in the standard link prediction task, significantly and consistently outperforming competitive baselines.

In this paper, we developed a time domain based optimized Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) models for the prediction of real world RF power within the GSM 900, Very High Frequency (VHF) and Ultra High Frequency (UHF) FM and TV bands. Sensitivity analysis was used to reduce the input vector of the prediction models.

The application of the models produced was found to increase the robustness of CR applications, specifically where the CR had no prior knowledge of the RF power related parameters such as signal to noise ratio, bandwidth and bit error rate. Since CR are embedded communication devices with memory constrain limitation, the models used, implemented a novel and innovative initial weight optimization of the ANN's through the use of compact differential evolutionary (cDE) algorithm variants which are memory efficient.

Transfer learning can provide a promising and effective solution by transferring knowledge from generic image recognition tasks to the medical image classification.

However, PGD AT has been shown to suffer from two main limitations: i) high computational cost, and ii) extreme overfitting during training that leads to reduction in model generalization. While the effect of factors such as model capacity and scale of training data on adversarial robustness have been extensively studied, little attention has been paid to the effect of a very important parameter in every network optimization on adversarial robustness: the learning rate. In particular, we hypothesize that effective learning rate scheduling during adversarial training can significantly reduce the overfitting issue, to a degree where one does not even need to adversarially train a model from scratch but can instead simply adversarially fine-tune a pre-trained model. Motivated by this hypothesis, we propose a simple yet very effective adversarial fine-tuning approach based on a ‘slow start, fast decay’ learning rate scheduling strategy which not only significantly decreases computational cost required, but also greatly improves the accuracy and robustness of a deep neural network. Experimental results show that the proposed adversarial fine-tuning approach outperforms the state-ofthe-art methods on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets in both test accuracy and the robustness, while reducing the computational cost by 8–10×. Furthermore, a very important benefit of the proposed adversarial finetuning approach is that it enables the ability to improve the robustness of any pre-trained deep neural network without needing to train the model from scratch, which to the best of the authors’ knowledge has not been previously demonstrated in research literature.","",""

However, these proposed analog accelerators suffer from the intrinsic noise generated by their physical components, which makes it challenging to achieve high accuracy on deep neural networks. Hence, for successful deployment on analog accelerators, it is essential to be able to train deep neural networks to be robust to random continuous noise in the network weights, which is a somewhat new challenge in machine learning.

The Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are used to solve a number of scientific problems. It has the capability to approximate any continuous non-linear function to arbitrary accuracy [10]. A multi-layer feed-forward neural network can approximate a continuous function due to its robustness, parallel architecture and fault tolerance capability. In past years, ANN models are used by a number of researchers to estimate solar radiation [11–15] and concluded that ANN model are proven to be superior to other empirical regression models. Reddy [11] used Radial Basis Functions (RBF) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models to predict solar radiation using data from eight stations in Oman.

Curriculum learning, a learning paradigm that learns easy samples first and then gradually proceeds with hard ones, has shown excellent results in dealing with label noise for deep neural networks (DNNs). However, most previous studies focus on image classification, and design their curriculum only based on training losses of samples, ignoring domain-specific knowledge. In this paper, we propose a predefined curriculum learning based framework, incorporating both training losses of samples and domain-specific knowledge, to train robust deep models for paraphrase identification (PI) with label noise. Through extensive experiments on two popular PI benchmarks, we show that 1) the performance of the deep paraphrase identification model can drop sharply at the case of severe label noise; 2) our approach can significantly improve generalization performance of deep networks trained on corrupted data especially at extremely high levels of label noise; 3) our method can outperform several state-of-the-art label corruption robust methods.","",""

In tradition, KD usually relies on access to the training samples and the parameters of the white-box teacher to acquire the transferred knowledge. However, these prerequisites are not always realistic due to storage costs or privacy issues in real-world applications. Here we propose the concept of decision-based black-box (DB3) knowledge distillation, with which the student is trained by distilling the knowledge from a black-box teacher (parameters are not accessible) that only returns classes rather than softmax outputs. We start with the scenario when the training set is accessible. We represent a sample's robustness against other classes by computing its distances to the teacher's decision boundaries and use it to construct the soft label for each training sample. After that, the student can be trained via standard KD. We then extend this approach to a more challenging scenario in which even accessing the training data is not feasible. We propose to generate pseudo samples distinguished by the teacher's decision boundaries to the largest extent and construct soft labels for them, which are used as the transfer set. We evaluate our approaches on various benchmark networks and datasets and experiment results demonstrate their effectiveness. Codes are available at: this https URL.","",""

Recent work has begun to explore the design of biologically inspired soft robots composed of soft, stretchable materials for applications including the handling of delicate materials and safe interaction with humans. However, the solid-state sensors traditionally used in robotics are unable to capture the high-dimensional deformations of soft systems. Embedded soft resistive sensors have the potential to address this challenge. However, both the soft sensors—and the encasing dynamical system—often exhibit nonlinear time-variant behavior, which makes them difficult to model. In addition, the problems of sensor design, placement, and fabrication require a great deal of human input and previous knowledge. Drawing inspiration from the human perceptive system, we created a synthetic analog. Our synthetic system builds models using a redundant and unstructured sensor topology embedded in a soft actuator, a vision-based motion capture system for ground truth, and a general machine learning approach. This allows us to model an unknown soft actuated system. We demonstrate that the proposed approach is able to model the kinematics of a soft continuum actuator in real time while being robust to sensor nonlinearities and drift. In addition, we show how the same system can estimate the applied forces while interacting with external objects. The role of action in perception is also presented. This approach enables the development of force and deformation models for soft robotic systems, which can be useful for a variety of applications, including human-robot interaction, soft orthotics, and wearable robotics.","",""

However these approaches are not robust or applicable in many real-world scenarios. In this paper we explore the feasibility of device fingerprinting under challenging realistic settings, by identifying artifacts in the transmitted signals caused by devices' unique hardware “imperfections”. We develop RF-DCN, a novel Deep Complex-valued Neural Network (DCN) that operates on raw RF signals and is completely agnostic of the underlying applications and protocols. We introduce two DCN variations: a retrofitted Convolutional DCN (CDCN) originally created for acoustic signals, and a novel Recurrent DCN (RDCN) for modeling time series. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of operating on raw I/Q data collected within a narrowband spectrum from open air captures across vastly different modulation schemes. In contrast to prior work, we do not utilize knowledge of the modulation scheme or protocol intricacies such as carrier frequencies. We conduct an extensive experimental evaluation on large and diverse datasets as part of a DARPA red team evaluation, and investigate the effects of different environmental factors as well as neural network architectures and hyperparameters on our system's performance. Our novel RDCN consistently outperforms all baseline neural network architectures, is robust to noise, and can identify a target device even when numerous devices are concurrently transmitting within the band of interest under the same or different protocols. While our experiments demonstrate the applicability of our techniques under challenging conditions where other neural network architectures break down, we identify additional challenges in signal-based fingerprinting and provide guidelines for future explorations.","",""
