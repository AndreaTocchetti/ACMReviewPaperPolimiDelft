To reduce the chattering phenomena in the excitation signal, fuzzy system is employed for the adaptive adjustment of the discontinuous control gain while preserving the robustness of the closed-loop system. The stability of the closed loop system with fuzzy fractional order robust control (FFORC) is ensured using fractional order Lyapunov system. The proposed FFORC control scheme is tested using processor in the loop (PIL) experiment.MATLAB/Simulink environment is used to emulate DFIG based wind energy system and a Texas Instrument (TI) DSP320F37D processor is used for interfacing the proposed control scheme with the emulated DFIG model in Simulink environment. System performance under the proposed FFORC scheme is compared with classical sliding mode control(SMC).The experimental results justifies the superiority of the proposed FFORC control scheme under all test conditions.Under ideal condition and with the proposed FFORC control scheme, the speed tracking error is approximately zero while with SMC method the peak tracking error is 0.4 radian/s. Similarly the active and reactive powers tracking is smooth with the proposed control system, while with SMC method the reactive power oscillates on both sides of the reference and it reaches 0.01 kVAR on positive side and −0.01kVAR on the negative side of the plot.Under parameters variation, system with FFORC control scheme offers minimum steady state error which is about 0.01 radian/s, while in case of SMC with saturation function a peak value of 0.6 radian/s is recorded. In case of SMC with sgn function, the speed tracking error is around 0.1 radian/s.Moreover the proposed FFORC scheme exhibits minimum chattering.","",""

Indeed, none of the existing two broad classes of methods (the time domain and the direct methods) are able to meet the on-line requirements of the analysis aspects, nor are they in the least appropriate to tackle control aspects. The methodology we are introducing aims at solving the above stated on-line problem by making use of decision rules, preconstructed off-line.

Rather than purely fitting the observed training data, stable learning tries to learn a model with uniformly good performance under non-stationary and agnostic testing data. The key challenge of stable learning in practice is that we do not have any knowledge about the true model and test data distribution as a priori. Under such condition, we cannot expect a faithful estimation of model parameters and its stability over wild changing environments. Previous methods resort to a reweighting scheme to remove the correlations between all the variables through a set of new sample weights. However, we argue that such aggressive decorrelation between all the variables may cause the over-reduced sample size, which leads to the variance inflation and possible underperformance. In this paper, we incorporate the unlabled data from multiple environments into the variable decorrelation framework and propose a Differentiated Variable Decorrelation (DVD) algorithm based on the clustering of variables. Specifically, the variables are clustered according to the stability of their correlations and the variable decorrelation module learns a set of sample weights to remove the correlations merely between the variables of different clusters. Empirical studies on both synthetic and real world datasets clearly demonstrate the efficacy of our DVD algorithm on improving the model parameter estimation and the prediction stability over changing distributions.","",""

Robotic systems controlling is vital due to the wide range of application. Obviously stability and robustness are the most minimum requirements in control systems; even though the proof of stability and robustness is more important especially in the case of nonlinear systems. The strategies of robotic manipulators control are classified into two main groups: classical and non-classical methods, where the conventional control theory uses the classical method and the artificial intelligence theory (e.g., fuzzy logic, neural network, and neuro fuzzy) uses the non-classical methods. However both of classical and non-classical theories have applied successfully in many applications, but they also have some limitations.

To cope with these demands, a high sensor quantity and quality allows us to perform robust locomotion. The authors present a hominid robotic system that is equipped with multi‐point‐contact feet and an active artificial spine to incorporate extended sensing and locomotion capabilities for walking robots. In the proposed robotic system, the front and rear part are connected via an actuated spinal structure with six degrees of freedom. To increase the robustness of the system's locomotion in terms of traction and stability, a footlike structure equipped with various sensors has been developed. Altogether, the robot embodies more than 330 sensors. In terms of distributed local control, the structures feature their own local intelligence and are as autonomous as possible regarding sensing, sensor preprocessing, control, and communication. This allows the robot to respond to external disturbances with minor latency. Within this paper, the proposed robotic system and its distributed and hierarchical control method are presented. To validate the electromechanical and software approach, the authors present results verified experimentally in different environments (in‐ and outdoor) with differing walking speeds on various substrates and in varying inclinations from −20∘ to 20°. The results show that the presented approach is viable and improves the flexibility of the locomotor system. A hominid design was chosen in order to perform various types of locomotion. To demonstrate the entire functionality of the developed hardware, two different motion modes (quadrupedal and bipedal locomotion) are investigated.

The present paper addresses this problem while concerning the integration of intermittent wind power and load disturbance into the WIPS. With this intent, it proposes the compensated superconducting magnetic energy storage (CSMES) system with proportional integral derivative (PID) controller for improving the frequency and power deviation profile. A novel swarm intelligence-based artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is used for optimal design of PID-CSMES system. Robustness of the proposed ABC-based PID-CSMES control strategy is tested in WIPS under various disturbance patterns of load and wind power. To demonstrate the improved dynamic response, their simulation results are compared with particle swarm optimization-based PID-CSMES, PID with SMES, and only PID controller technique. The performance indices and transient response characteristics of frequency and power deviation are used to evaluate and compare the accuracy and efficiency of each controller. Stability of various system configurations is analyzed using eigenvalue location. Comparing the results of different controller in WIPS indicates a substantial improvement in the dynamic response of system frequency and power deviations by utilizing the proposed control strategy.","",""

We focus on the model-based, also called model-building, algorithms that attempt to build the model along with optimization of the decision-making process. Model-based algorithms have certain advantages over model-free algorithms in that their behavior is more stable and robust. Another aspect of robustness and stability of the algorithm has to do with the variability in the value of the performance measure returned by the algorithm. We will present a new model-building algorithm that builds the transition probability model simultaneously with the value function and a new variance-penalizing algorithm that exhibits robustness with respect to the performance measure. Keyword 1: Optimization Keyword 2: Algorithm, Artificial Intelligence, operations research. INTRODUCTION Reinforcement learning (Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis, 1996; Sutton and Barto, 1998; Gosavi, 2003) seeks to solve Markov decision processes or problems (MDPs) via simulation-based optimization. Much of the literature in reinforcement learning (RL) focusses on bypassing the construction of the transition probability matrices (TPMs) needed in dynamic programming (DP). Indeed, the ability to solve the MDP without generating the TPM is one of the reasons why RL can break the curses of modeling and dimensionality that plague DP. However, bypassing the TPM model does come with a cost. It makes the RL algorithm’s convergence dependent on selecting an appropriate step-size (learning rate). This results in the performance becoming highly susceptible to optimal tuning of parameters that define the step size. In this paper, we seek to develop a model-building algorithm that generates the TPM simultaneously with the value function. The other algorithm we develop is one that studies robustness with respect to the variability in the performance metric.","",""

Very often, control techniques of the first type are called ""classical control"", while methods of the second type are called ""intelligent control"". We do not find these appellations are very relevant, as they tend to classify the first methods as guaranteed to work but impracticable and the second methods as easy to implement but magical; we will try to see in each method the advantages and the drawbacks rather than going on with the useless dialectic between Moderns and Ancients.

Given a model and an input instance, CERTIFAI uses a custom genetic algorithm to generate counterfactuals: instances close to the input that change the prediction of the model.

Owing to their unique features, including low cost of production, easy chemical modification, high thermal stability, reproducibility, as well as low levels of immunogenicity and toxicity, aptamers can be used as an alternative to antibodies in diagnostics and therapeutics. Systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX), an experimental approach for aptamer screening, allows the selection and identification of in vitro aptamers with high affinity and specificity. However, the SELEX process is time consuming and characterization of the representative aptamer candidates from SELEX is rather laborious. Artificial intelligence (AI) could help to rapidly identify the potential aptamer candidates from a vast number of sequences. This review discusses the advancements of AI pipelines/methods, including structure-based and machine/deep learning-based methods, for predicting the binding ability of aptamers to targets. Structure-based methods are the most used in computer-aided drug design. For this part, we review the secondary and tertiary structure prediction methods for aptamers, molecular docking, as well as molecular dynamic simulation methods for aptamer–target binding. We also performed analysis to compare the accuracy of different secondary and tertiary structure prediction methods for aptamers. On the other hand, advanced machine-/deep-learning models have witnessed successes in predicting the binding abilities between targets and ligands in drug discovery and thus potentially offer a robust and accurate approach to predict the binding between aptamers and targets. The research utilizing machine-/deep-learning techniques for prediction of aptamer–target binding is limited currently. Therefore, perspectives for models, algorithms, and implementation strategies of machine/deep learning-based methods are discussed. This review could facilitate the development and application of high-throughput and less laborious in silico methods in aptamer selection and characterization.","",""

Therefore, modeling and predicting water quality have become very important in controlling water pollution. In this work, advanced artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are developed to predict water quality index (WQI) and water quality classification (WQC). For the WQI prediction, artificial neural network models, namely nonlinear autoregressive neural network (NARNET) and long short-term memory (LSTM) deep learning algorithm, have been developed. In addition, three machine learning algorithms, namely, support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbor (K-NN), and Naive Bayes, have been used for the WQC forecasting. The used dataset has 7 significant parameters, and the developed models were evaluated based on some statistical parameters. The results revealed that the proposed models can accurately predict WQI and classify the water quality according to superior robustness. Prediction results demonstrated that the NARNET model performed slightly better than the LSTM for the prediction of the WQI values and the SVM algorithm has achieved the highest accuracy (97.01%) for the WQC prediction. Furthermore, the NARNET and LSTM models have achieved similar accuracy for the testing phase with a slight difference in the regression coefficient (RNARNET = 96.17% and RLSTM = 94.21%).

However, health care has been relatively late to adopt them. This article provides clinical examples in which machine learning and artificial intelligence are already in use in health care and appear to deliver benefit. Three key bottlenecks toward increasing the pace of diffusion and adoption are methodological issues in evaluation of artificial intelligence-based interventions, reporting standards to enable assessment of model performance, and issues that need to be addressed for an institution to adopt these interventions. Methodological best practices will include external validation, ideally at a different site; use of proactive learning algorithms to correct for site-specific biases and increase robustness as algorithms are deployed across multiple sites; addressing subgroup performance; and communicating to providers the uncertainty of predictions. Regarding reporting, especially important issues are the extent to which implementing standardized approaches for introducing clinical decision support has been followed, describing the data sources, reporting on data assumptions, and addressing biases. Although most health care organizations in the United States have adopted electronic health records, they may be ill prepared to adopt machine learning and artificial intelligence. Several steps can enable this: preparing data, developing tools to get suggestions to clinicians in useful ways, and getting clinicians engaged in the process. Open challenges and the role of regulation in this area are briefly discussed. Although these techniques have enormous potential to improve care and personalize recommendations for individuals, the hype regarding them is tremendous.

However, this approach is valid for monotonic transformation and narrow-banded processes. When the bandwidth of a random process is wide, no reasonable methods are available for acquiring the extreme value. This paper therefore applies the artificial neural network and genetic algorithm to do the extreme value prediction, without seeking rigorous mathematical derivations. Not only skewness and kurtosis are used, the spectral moments up to 4th-order reflecting bandwidth effects are also adopted.

The use of artificial intelligence (AI) offers an opportunity to improve risk prediction. Here we compare the performance of an AI algorithm, the lung cancer prediction convolutional neural network (LCP-CNN), with that of the Brock University model, recommended in UK guidelines. Methods A dataset of incidentally detected pulmonary nodules measuring 5–15 mm was collected retrospectively from three UK hospitals for use in a validation study. Ground truth diagnosis for each nodule was based on histology (required for any cancer), resolution, stability or (for pulmonary lymph nodes only) expert opinion. There were 1397 nodules in 1187 patients, of which 234 nodules in 229 (19.3%) patients were cancer. Model discrimination and performance statistics at predefined score thresholds were compared between the Brock model and the LCP-CNN. Results The area under the curve for LCP-CNN was 89.6% (95% CI 87.6 to 91.5), compared with 86.8% (95% CI 84.3 to 89.1) for the Brock model (p≤0.005). Using the LCP-CNN, we found that 24.5% of nodules scored below the lowest cancer nodule score, compared with 10.9% using the Brock score. Using the predefined thresholds, we found that the LCP-CNN gave one false negative (0.4% of cancers), whereas the Brock model gave six (2.5%), while specificity statistics were similar between the two models. Conclusion The LCP-CNN score has better discrimination and allows a larger proportion of benign nodules to be identified without missing cancers than the Brock model. This has the potential to substantially reduce the proportion of surveillance CT scans required and thus save significant resources.","",""

Methods and analysis TRIPOD-AI and PROBAST-AI will be developed following published guidance from the EQUATOR Network, and will comprise five stages. Stage 1 will comprise two systematic reviews (across all medical fields and specifically in oncology) to examine the quality of reporting in published machine-learning-based prediction model studies. In stage 2, we will consult a diverse group of key stakeholders using a Delphi process to identify items to be considered for inclusion in TRIPOD-AI and PROBAST-AI. Stage 3 will be virtual consensus meetings to consolidate and prioritise key items to be included in TRIPOD-AI and PROBAST-AI. Stage 4 will involve developing the TRIPOD-AI checklist and the PROBAST-AI tool, and writing the accompanying explanation and elaboration papers. In the final stage, stage 5, we will disseminate TRIPOD-AI and PROBAST-AI via journals, conferences, blogs, websites (including TRIPOD, PROBAST and EQUATOR Network) and social media. TRIPOD-AI will provide researchers working on prediction model studies based on machine learning with a reporting guideline that can help them report key details that readers need to evaluate the study quality and interpret its findings, potentially reducing research waste. We anticipate PROBAST-AI will help researchers, clinicians, systematic reviewers and policymakers critically appraise the design, conduct and analysis of machine learning based prediction model studies, with a robust standardised tool for bias evaluation.

Specifically, the rotor angle stability has been identified as one of the major obstacle with regards to power electronics dominated power systems. To date, conventional power system stabilizer (PSS) devices are used for damping electromechanical oscillations, which are only tuned sporadically leading to significant deterioration in performance against the ever-changing operating conditions. In this paper, an intelligent power oscillation damper (iPOD) is proposed for grid-forming converters to attenuate electromechanical inter-area power oscillation. In particular, the iPOD is applied to a synchronous power controller (SPC) based grid-forming power converter to increases gain of the active power control loop at the oscillatory frequency. Predictions regarding the mode frequency, corresponding to the current operating points, are given by an artificial intelligence ensemble model called Random Forests. The performance of the proposed controller is verified using the two area system considering symmetrical fault for random operating points. In addition, a comparison with PSS installed in each generator reveals the individual contribution with respect to the inter-area mode damping.","",""

AI is bringing many benefits to petrophysical evaluation. Using case studies, this paper describes several successful applications. The future of AI has even more potential. However, if used carelessly there are potentially grave consequences. A complex Middle East Carbonate field needed a bespoke shaly water saturation equation. AI was used to ‘evolve’ an ideal equation, together with field specific saturation and cementation exponents. One UKCS gas field had an ‘oil problem’. Here, AI was used to unlock the hidden fluid information in the NMR T1 and T2 spectra and successfully differentiate oil and gas zones in real time. A North Sea field with 30 wells had shear velocity data (Vs) in only 4 wells. Vs was required for reservoir modelling and well bore stability prediction. AI was used to predict Vs in all 30 wells. Incorporating high vertical resolution data, the Vs predictions were even better than the recorded logs. As it is not economic to take core data on every well, AI is used to discover the relationships between logs, core, litho-facies and permeability in multi-dimensional data space. As a consequence, all wells in a field were populated with these data to build a robust reservoir model. In addition, the AI predicted data upscaled correctly unlike many conventional techniques. AI gives impressive results when automatically log quality controlling (LQC) and repairing electrical logs for bad hole and sections of missing data. AI doesn’t require prior knowledge of the petrophysical response equations and is self-calibrating. There are no parameters to pick or cross-plots to make. There is very little user intervention and AI avoids the problem of ‘garbage in, garbage out’ (GIGO), by ignoring noise and outliers. AI programs work with an unlimited number of electrical logs, core and gas chromatography data; and don’t ‘fall-over’ if some of those inputs are missing. AI programs currently being developed include ones where their machine code evolves using similar rules used by life’s DNA code. These AI programs pose considerable dangers far beyond the oil industry as described in this paper. A ‘risk assessment’ is essential on all AI programs so that all hazards and risk factors, that could cause harm, are identified and mitigated.","",""

While user studies are a known basis for evaluating XAI, studies that do not consider objective metrics for evaluating XAI may have limited meaning and may suffer from confirmation bias, particularly if they use low fidelity explanations unnecessarily. To avoid this issue, this paper suggests a paradigm shift in evaluating XAI that focuses on metrics that quantify the explanation itself and its appropriateness given the XAI goal. We suggest four such metrics based on performance differences, D, between the explanation’s logic and the agent’s actual performance, the number of rules, R, outputted by the explanation, the number of features, F , used to generate that explanation, and the stability, S, of the explanation.

Here, tailoring ligand chemistry can alter preferred spin or oxidation states as well as electronic structure properties and reactivity, creating vast regions of chemical space to explore when designing new materials atom by atom. Although first-principles density functional theory (DFT) remains the workhorse of computational chemistry in mechanism deduction and property prediction, it is of limited use here. DFT is both far too computationally costly for widespread exploration of transition-metal chemical space and also prone to inaccuracies that limit its predictive performance for localized d electrons in transition-metal complexes. These challenges starkly contrast with the well-trodden regions of small-organic-molecule chemical space, where the analytical forms of molecular mechanics force fields and semiempirical theories have for decades accelerated the discovery of new molecules, accurate DFT functional performance has been demonstrated, and gold-standard methods from correlated wavefunction theory can predict experimental results to chemical accuracy.The combined promise of transition-metal chemical space exploration and lack of established tools has mandated a distinct approach. In this Account, we outline the path we charted in exploration of transition-metal chemical space starting from the first machine learning (ML) models (i.e., artificial neural network and kernel ridge regression) and representations for the prediction of open-shell transition-metal complex properties. The distinct importance of the immediate coordination environment of the metal center as well as the lack of low-level methods to accurately predict structural properties in this coordination environment first motivated and then benefited from these ML models and representations. Once developed, the recipe for prediction of geometric, spin state, and redox potential properties was straightforwardly extended to a diverse range of other properties, including in catalysis, computational ""feasibility"", and the gas separation properties of periodic metal-organic frameworks. Interpretation of selected features most important for model prediction revealed new ways to encapsulate design rules and confirmed that models were robustly mapping essential structure-property relationships. Encountering the special challenge of ensuring that good model performance could generalize to new discovery targets motivated investigation of how to best carry out model uncertainty quantification. Distance-based approaches, whether in model latent space or in carefully engineered feature space, provided intuitive measures of the domain of applicability. With all of these pieces together, ML can be harnessed as an engine to tackle the large-scale exploration of transition-metal chemical space needed to satisfy multiple objectives using efficient global optimization methods. In practical terms, bringing these artificial intelligence tools to bear on the problems of transition-metal chemical space exploration has resulted in ML-model assessments of large, multimillion compound spaces in minutes and validated new design leads in weeks instead of decades.","",""

An important aspect of this is evaluating how robust a model is to changes in setting or population, which typically requires applying the model to multiple, independent datasets. Since the cost of collecting such datasets is often prohibitive, in this paper, we propose a framework for analyzing this type of stability using the available data. We use the original evaluation data to determine distributions under which the algorithm performs poorly, and estimate the algorithm’s performance on the “worst-case” distribution. We consider shifts in user defined conditional distributions, allowing some distributions to shift while keeping other portions of the data distribution fixed. For example, in a healthcare context, this allows us to consider shifts in clinical practice while keeping the patient population fixed. To address the challenges associated with estimation in complex, high-dimensional distributions, we derive a “debiased” estimator which maintains p N -consistency even when machine learning methods with slower convergence rates are used to estimate the nuisance parameters. In experiments on a real medical risk prediction task, we show this estimator can be used to analyze stability and accounts for realistic shifts that could not previously be expressed. The proposed framework allows practitioners to proactively evaluate the safety of their models without requiring additional data collection.

Therefore, this paper presents differential privacy mechanisms for multi-agent systems, reinforcement learning, and knowledge transfer based on those properties, which proves that current AI can benefit from differential privacy mechanisms. In addition, the previous usage of differential privacy mechanisms in private machine learning, distributed machine learning, and fairness in models is discussed, bringing several possible avenues to use differential privacy mechanisms in AI. The purpose of this paper is to deliver the initial idea of how to integrate AI with differential privacy mechanisms and to explore more possibilities to improve AIs performance.","",""

Volleyball is one of the most popular sports in the world. It attracts people all over the world with its strong team appeal and its own unique charm. This study mainly discusses the characteristics of shoulder joint dysfunction in volleyball players and the effect of rehabilitation training under the background of artificial intelligence. By sorting out the development process of artificial intelligence technology, it can be analyzed that artificial intelligence technology already has a certain knowledge reserve, can make corresponding mechanized feedback, and can make correct judgments based on experience in more complex situations. This study compared volleyball athletes with handicap and barrier-free shoulder joints and observed the characteristics of shoulder pain, stability, and flexibility caused by subacromial impingement syndrome. It also looked at whether subacromial impingement syndrome athletes differ in volleyball spiking sequence and mobilization and recruitment of muscle power during swing spikes compared to athletes with normal shoulder function in the full kinetic chain. According to the volleyball intelligent competition platform, the implementation and application of ideas such as data collection, result feedback, adjustment of training plan, implementation of training plan, and real-time monitoring are regularly monitored. On the one hand, through timely assessment and detection of shoulder function of volleyball players, functional training is carried out for weaknesses to prevent injury; on the other hand, after a mild injury occurs, timely targeted training should be taken to find and correct wrong actions, and strengthen the weak part of muscle strength, so as to reduce the probability of repeated injury and improve sports performance and athletic ability. In the new system, after collecting and sorting, testers can directly upload to the web page in the form of Excel for automatic filling, grasp the test information of athletes in time, generate automatic warning, and save time. The monitoring content determined by this study mainly includes three index systems, including load, training preparation performance, and recovery. According to the self-provided evaluation system of relevant test equipment and the experience of expert coaches, the evaluation standards for each index are formulated. There was a statistically significant difference in the scores between the rehabilitation group and the pre-rehabilitation group during the study (P < 0.05). This study attempts to find the characteristics and rules of FMS scores of women's volleyball players of different levels, so as to provide more targeted physical training for volleyball players, promote the all-round development of physical fitness, and avoid the risk of sports injuries.

SUMMARY ANSWER We have combined computer vision image processing methods and deep learning techniques to create the non-invasive Life Whisperer AI model for robust prediction of embryo viability, as measured by clinical pregnancy outcome, using single static images of Day 5 blastocysts obtained from standard optical light microscope systems. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY Embryo selection following IVF is a critical factor in determining the success of ensuing pregnancy. Traditional morphokinetic grading by trained embryologists can be subjective and variable, and other complementary techniques, such as time-lapse imaging, require costly equipment and have not reliably demonstrated predictive ability for the endpoint of clinical pregnancy. AI methods are being investigated as a promising means for improving embryo selection and predicting implantation and pregnancy outcomes. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION These studies involved analysis of retrospectively collected data including standard optical light microscope images and clinical outcomes of 8886 embryos from 11 different IVF clinics, across three different countries, between 2011 and 2018. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS The AI-based model was trained using static two-dimensional optical light microscope images with known clinical pregnancy outcome as measured by fetal heartbeat to provide a confidence score for prediction of pregnancy. Predictive accuracy was determined by evaluating sensitivity, specificity and overall weighted accuracy, and was visualized using histograms of the distributions of predictions. Comparison to embryologists’ predictive accuracy was performed using a binary classification approach and a 5-band ranking comparison. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE The Life Whisperer AI model showed a sensitivity of 70.1% for viable embryos while maintaining a specificity of 60.5% for non-viable embryos across three independent blind test sets from different clinics. The weighted overall accuracy in each blind test set was >63%, with a combined accuracy of 64.3% across both viable and non-viable embryos, demonstrating model robustness and generalizability beyond the result expected from chance. Distributions of predictions showed clear separation of correctly and incorrectly classified embryos. Binary comparison of viable/non-viable embryo classification demonstrated an improvement of 24.7% over embryologists’ accuracy (P = 0.047, n = 2, Student’s t test), and 5-band ranking comparison demonstrated an improvement of 42.0% over embryologists (P = 0.028, n = 2, Student’s t test). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION The AI model developed here is limited to analysis of Day 5 embryos; therefore, further evaluation or modification of the model is needed to incorporate information from different time points. The endpoint described is clinical pregnancy as measured by fetal heartbeat, and this does not indicate the probability of live birth. The current investigation was performed with retrospectively collected data, and hence it will be of importance to collect data prospectively to assess real-world use of the AI model. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS These studies demonstrated an improved predictive ability for evaluation of embryo viability when compared with embryologists’ traditional morphokinetic grading methods. The superior accuracy of the Life Whisperer AI model could lead to improved pregnancy success rates in IVF when used in a clinical setting. It could also potentially assist in standardization of embryo selection methods across multiple clinical environments, while eliminating the need for complex time-lapse imaging equipment. Finally, the cloud-based software application used to apply the Life Whisperer AI model in clinical practice makes it broadly applicable and globally scalable to IVF clinics worldwide.

Large price swings can be detrimental to producers and consumers, causing infrastructure and capacity investments to be delayed, employment losses, inefficient investments, and/or the growth potential for energy-producing countries to be adversely affected. Undoubtedly, greater stability of oil prices increases the certainty of oil markets for the benefit of oil consumers and producers. Therefore, modeling and forecasting crude-oil price volatility is a strategic endeavor for many oil market and investment applications.  This paper focuses on the development of a new predictive model for describing and forecasting the behavior and dynamics of global oil-price volatility. Using a hybrid approach of artificial intelligence with a genetic algorithm (GA), artificial neural network (ANN), and data mining (DM) time-series (TS), a (GANNATS) model was developed to forecast the futures price volatility of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude. The WTI price volatility model was successfully designed, trained, verified, and tested using historical oil market data. The predictions from the GANNATS model closely matched the historical data of WTI futures price volatility. The model not only described the behavior and captured the dynamics of oil-price volatility, but also demonstrated the capability for predicting the direction of movements of oil market volatility with an accuracy of 88%.  The model is applicable as a predictive tool for oil-price volatility and its direction of movements, benefiting oil producers, consumers, investors, and traders. It assists these key market players in making sound decisions and taking corrective courses of action for oil market stability, development strategies, and future investments; this could lead to increased profits and to reduced costs and market losses. In addition, this improved method for modeling oil-price volatility enables experts and market analysts to empirically test new approaches for mitigating market volatility. It also provides a roadmap for improving the predictability and accuracy of energy and crude models.","",""

We argue that countries may be more likely to use risky forms of autonomy when they fear that their second-strike capabilities will be undermined. Additionally, the potential deployment of uninhabited, autonomous nuclear delivery platforms and vehicles could raise the prospect for accidents and miscalculation.

Lastly, trustworthiness into, and generalizability of, dental AI solutions need to be guaranteed; the implementation of continuous human oversight and standards grounded in evidence-based dentistry should be expected. Methods to visualize, interpret, and explain the logic behind AI solutions will contribute (“explainable AI”). Dental education will need to accompany the introduction of clinical AI solutions by fostering digital literacy in the future dental workforce.","",""

Wireless instruments that are integrated with artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms and knowledge-based decision support systems have attracted growers’ attention due to their implementation flexibility, contribution to energy reduction, and yield predictability. Sustainable production of fruits and vegetables under greenhouse environments with reduced energy inputs entails proper integration of the existing climate control systems with IoT automation in order to incorporate real-time data transfer from multiple sensors into AI algorithms and crop growth models using cloud-based streaming systems. This chapter provides an overview of such an automation workflow in greenhouse environments by means of distributed wireless nodes that are custom-designed based on the powerful dual-core 32-bit microcontroller with LoRa modulation at 868 MHz. Sample results from commercial and research greenhouse experiments with the IoT hardware and software have been provided to show connection stability, robustness, and reliability. The presented setup allows deployment of AI on embedded hardware units such as CPUs and GPUs, or on cloud-based streaming systems that collect precise measurements from multiple sensors in different locations inside greenhouse environments.","",""

A DSS can be successful if large amounts of interactive data proceed fast and robustly and extract useful information and knowledge to help decision-making. In this context, the data-driven approach has gained prominence due to its provision of insights for decision-making and easy implementation. The data-driven approach can discover various database patterns without relying on prior knowledge while also handling flexible objectives and multiple scenarios. This chapter reviews recent advances in data-driven optimization, highlighting the promise of data-driven optimization that integrates mathematical programming and machine learning (ML) for decision-making under uncertainty and identifies potential research opportunities. This chapter provides guidelines and implications for researchers, managers, and practitioners in operations research who want to advance their decision-making capabilities under uncertainty concerning data-driven optimization. Then, a comprehensive review and classification of the relevant publications on the data-driven stochastic program, data-driven robust optimization, and data-driven chance-constrained are presented. This chapter also identifies fertile avenues for future research that focus on deep-data-driven optimization, deep data-driven models, as well as online learning-based data-driven optimization. Perspectives on reinforcement learning (RL)-based data-driven optimization and deep RL for solving NP-hard problems are discussed. We investigate the application of data-driven optimization in different case studies to demonstrate improvements in operational performance over conventional optimization methodology.

In this setting the algorithms consistently learn to charge supra-competitive prices, without communicating with one another. The high prices are sustained by classical collusive strategies with a finite phase of punishment followed by a gradual return to cooperation. This finding is robust to asymmetries in cost or demand and to changes in the number of players.","",""

Objective The purpose of this systematic literature review was to identify and analyze quantitative studies utilizing or integrating AI to address and report clinical-level patient safety outcomes. Methods We restricted our search to the PubMed, PubMed Central, and Web of Science databases to retrieve research articles published in English between January 2009 and August 2019. We focused on quantitative studies that reported positive, negative, or intermediate changes in patient safety outcomes using AI apps, specifically those based on machine-learning algorithms and natural language processing. Quantitative studies reporting only AI performance but not its influence on patient safety outcomes were excluded from further review. Results We identified 53 eligible studies, which were summarized concerning their patient safety subcategories, the most frequently used AI, and reported performance metrics. Recognized safety subcategories were clinical alarms (n=9; mainly based on decision tree models), clinical reports (n=21; based on support vector machine models), and drug safety (n=23; mainly based on decision tree models). Analysis of these 53 studies also identified two essential findings: (1) the lack of a standardized benchmark and (2) heterogeneity in AI reporting. Conclusions This systematic review indicates that AI-enabled decision support systems, when implemented correctly, can aid in enhancing patient safety by improving error detection, patient stratification, and drug management. Future work is still needed for robust validation of these systems in prospective and real-world clinical environments to understand how well AI can predict safety outcomes in health care settings.","",""

While digital imagery has greatly improved the speed of underwater data collection for monitoring benthic communities, image analysis remains a bottleneck in reporting observations. In recent years, a rapid evolution of artificial intelligence in image recognition has been evident in its broad applications in modern society, offering new opportunities for increasing the capabilities of coral reef monitoring. Here, we evaluated the performance of Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Networks for automated image analysis, using a global coral reef monitoring dataset. The study demonstrates the advantages of automated image analysis for coral reef monitoring in terms of error and repeatability of benthic abundance estimations, as well as cost and benefit. We found unbiased and high agreement between expert and automated observations (97%). Repeated surveys and comparisons against existing monitoring programs also show that automated estimation of benthic composition is equally robust in detecting change and ensuring the continuity of existing monitoring data. Using this automated approach, data analysis and reporting can be accelerated by at least 200x and at a fraction of the cost (1%). Combining commonly used underwater imagery in monitoring with automated image annotation can dramatically improve how we measure and monitor coral reefs worldwide, particularly in terms of allocating limited resources, rapid reporting and data integration within and across management areas.","",""

Artificial Intelligence (AI) models have evidenced their capacity to solve dynamic, uncertain and complex tasks. The aim of this current study is to develop a hybrid artificial intelligence model called integrative Random Forest classifier with Genetic Algorithm optimization (RF-GA) for delay problem prediction. At first, related sources and factors of delay problems are identified. A questionnaire is adopted to quantify the impact of delay sources on project performance. The developed hybrid model is trained using the collected data of the previous construction projects. The proposed RF-GA is validated against the classical version of an RF model using statistical performance measure indices. The achieved results of the developed hybrid RF-GA model revealed a good resultant performance in terms of accuracy, kappa and classification error. Based on the measured accuracy, kappa and classification error, RF-GA attained 91.67%, 87% and 8.33%, respectively. Overall, the proposed methodology indicated a robust and reliable technique for project delay prediction that is contributing to the construction project management monitoring and sustainability.","",""

However, data-driven AI models unequivocally suffer from a lack of sufficiently large and unbiased datasets. Here, we systematically investigated the data biases on the PDBbind and DUD-E datasets. We examined the model performance of atomic convolutional neural network (ACNN) on the PDBbind core set and achieved a Pearson R2 of 0.73 between experimental and predicted binding affinities. Strikingly, the ACNN models did not require learning the essential protein-ligand interactions in complex structures and achieved similar performance even on datasets containing only ligand structures or only protein structures, while data splitting based on similarity clustering (protein sequence or ligand scaffold) significantly reduced the model performance. We also identified the property and topology biases in the DUD-E dataset which led to the artificially increased enrichment performance of virtual screening. The property bias in DUD-E was reduced by enforcing the more stringent ligand property matching rules, while the topology bias still exists due to the use of molecular fingerprint similarity as a decoy selection criterion. Therefore, we believe that sufficiently large and unbiased datasets are desirable for training robust AI models to accurately predict protein-ligand interactions.","",""

We focus on two aspects of clinical artificial intelligence used for decision-making: moral accountability for harm to patients; and safety assurance to protect patients against such harm. Artificial intelligence-based tools are challenging the standard clinical practices of assigning blame and assuring safety. Human clinicians and safety engineers have weaker control over the decisions reached by artificial intelligence systems and less knowledge and understanding of precisely how the artificial intelligence systems reach their decisions. We illustrate this analysis by applying it to an example of an artificial intelligence-based system developed for use in the treatment of sepsis. The paper ends with practical suggestions for ways forward to mitigate these concerns. We argue for a need to include artificial intelligence developers and systems safety engineers in our assessments of moral accountability for patient harm. Meanwhile, none of the actors in the model robustly fulfil the traditional conditions of moral accountability for the decisions of an artificial intelligence system. We should therefore update our conceptions of moral accountability in this context. We also need to move from a static to a dynamic model of assurance, accepting that considerations of safety are not fully resolvable during the design of the artificial intelligence system before the system has been deployed.","",""
