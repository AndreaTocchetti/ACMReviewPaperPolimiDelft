Up to this moment, neural networks have been applied in power systems as a black box; this has presented a major barrier for their adoption in practice. Developing a rigorous framework based on mixed-integer linear programming, our methods can determine the range of inputs that neural networks classify as safe or unsafe, and are able to systematically identify adversarial examples. Such methods have the potential to build the missing trust of power system operators on neural networks, and unlock a series of new applications in power systems. This paper presents the framework, methods to assess and improve neural network robustness in power systems, and addresses concerns related to scalability and accuracy. We demonstrate our methods on the IEEE 9-bus, 14-bus, and 162-bus systems, treating both N-1 security and small-signal stability.","",""

While robust control methods provide rigorous guarantees on system stability under certain worst-case disturbances, they often result in simple controllers that perform poorly in the average (non-worst) case. In contrast, nonlinear control methods trained using deep learning have achieved state-of-the-art performance on many control tasks, but often lack robustness guarantees. We propose a technique that combines the strengths of these two approaches: a generic nonlinear control policy class, parameterized by neural networks, that nonetheless enforces the same provable robustness criteria as robust control. Specifically, we show that by integrating custom convex-optimization-based projection layers into a nonlinear policy, we can construct a provably robust neural network policy class that outperforms robust control methods in the average (non-adversarial) setting. We demonstrate the power of this approach on several domains, improving in performance over existing robust control methods and in stability over (non-robust) RL methods.","",""

To simultaneously enhance the convergence performance and robustness, this article proposes a new ZNN model by using a supertwisting (ST) algorithm, termed STZNN model, for the tracking control of mobile robot manipulators. The proposed STZNN model inherently possesses the advantages of finite-time convergence and robustness making the control process fast and robust. The bridge from the sliding mode control to the ZNN is built, and the essential connection between the ST algorithm and ZNN is explored by constructing a unified design process.

Previous empirical results suggest that adversarial training requires wider networks for better performances. However, it remains elusive how does neural network width affect model robustness. In this paper, we carefully examine the relationship between network width and model robustness. Specifically, we show that the model robustness is closely related to the tradeoff between natural accuracy and perturbation stability, which is controlled by the robust regularization parameter λ. With the same λ, wider networks can achieve better natural accuracy but worse perturbation stability, leading to a potentially worse overall model robustness. To understand the origin of this phenomenon, we further relate the perturbation stability with the network’s local Lipschitzness. By leveraging recent results on neural tangent kernels, we theoretically show that wider networks tend to have worse perturbation stability. Our analyses suggest that: 1) the common strategy of first fine-tuning λ on small networks and then directly use it for wide model training could lead to deteriorated model robustness; 2) one needs to properly enlarge λ to unleash the robustness potential of wider models fully. Finally, we propose a new Width Adjusted Regularization (WAR) method that adaptively enlarges λ on wide models and significantly saves the tuning time.","",""

This paper identifies two limitations of the existing RNN solutions for manipulator control, i.e., position error accumulation and the convex restriction on the projection set, and overcomes them by proposing two modified neural network models. Our method allows nonconvex sets for projection operations, and control error does not accumulate over time in the presence of noise.

The unstable learning scenario can be indirectly observed in the form of surges, which are sudden increases in the learning cost and are a common occurrence during SpikeProp training. Research in the past has shown that proper learning step size is crucial to minimize surges during training process.

A synthetic aperture radar (SAR) automatic target recognition (ATR) method based on the convolutional neural networks (CNN) trained by augmented training samples is proposed. To enhance the robustness of CNN to various extended operating conditions (EOCs), the original training images are used to generate the noisy samples at different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), multiresolution representations, and partially occluded images. Then, the generated images together with the original ones are used to train a designed CNN for target recognition. The augmented training samples can contrapuntally improve the robustness of the trained CNN to the covered EOCs, i.e., the noise corruption, resolution variance, and partial occlusion. Moreover, the significantly larger training set effectively enhances the representation capability for other conditions, e.g., the standard operating condition (SOC), as well as the stability of the network. Therefore, better performance can be achieved by the proposed method for SAR ATR. For experimental evaluation, extensive experiments are conducted on the Moving and Stationary Target Acquisition and Recognition dataset under SOC and several typical EOCs.","",""

In this paper, we theoretically and empirically show that with just more unlabeled data, we can learn a model with better adversarially robust generalization. The key insight of our results is based on a risk decomposition theorem, in which the expected robust risk is separated into two parts: the stability part which measures the prediction stability in the presence of perturbations, and the accuracy part which evaluates the standard classification accuracy. As the stability part does not depend on any label information, we can optimize this part using unlabeled data. We further prove that for a specific Gaussian mixture problem illustrated by [35], adversarially robust generalization can be almost as easy as the standard generalization in supervised learning if a sufficiently large amount of unlabeled data is provided.

To overcome this shortcoming, we modify the conventional network model by including extra dynamical interactions between neurons. These interactions vary according to the biologically plausible Hebbian learning rule and have the computational role of memorizing and propagating stimulus information accumulated with time. As a result, the new network model responds to the history of external inputs over a period of time, and hence becomes insensitive to short-term fluctuations. Also, since dynamical interactions provide a mechanism to convey the prior knowledge of stimulus, that is, the information of the stimulus presented previously, the network effectively implements online Bayesian inference.

The weighting factors of the RBFNN are updated on the condition of system stability. Due to the system states requirement of the DAC and measurement noise, a Kalman filter was introduced in this work to eliminate the output measurement noise and estimate the system states.

This paper considers the problem of online controller verification in a class of first-order nonlinear uncertain systems incorporating neural network based learning algorithms. Based on several critical assumptions, an on-line neural network model is employed to ensure robustness and fault-tolerance to certain modeling uncertainty and physical faults under consideration. However, these assumptions may be violated in the presence of software faults or unanticipated physical faults in the closed-loop system, leading to unstable learning behaviors and controller malfunctions. Based on Lyapunov stability theory, a online controller verification scheme is developed to detect such unstable learning behaviors by continuously monitoring the decrease of Lyapunov functions. Adaptive thresholds for detecting malfunctions of the adaptive learning controller are derived, ensuring the robustness with respect to modeling uncertainty and neural network approximation error. Additionally, the detectability conditions are investigated, characterizing the class of detectable software faults and unanticipated hardware faults. An upper bound on the detection time of controller malfunction is also derived.

The presented robust MPC scheme constitutes a one-layer approach that unifies the often separated planning and control layers, by directly computing the control command based on a reference and possibly obstacle positions. As a separate contribution, we show how the computation time of the MPC can be drastically reduced by approximating the MPC law with a NN controller. The NN is trained and validated from offline samples of the MPC, yielding statistical guarantees, and used in lieu thereof at run time. Our experiments on a state-of-the-art robot manipulator are the first to show that both the proposed robust and approximate MPC schemes scale to real-world robotic systems.","",""

In particular, the radial basis function neural network, which serves as a function approximator, aims to create a model for an unknown function to find a relationship between input and output data. An extended state observer is utilized to assist in canceling disturbances and uncertainties of the system dynamically. The stability of the control approach is analyzed. The convergence of position and velocity tracking errors is proven theoretically. Experiments are conducted to demonstrate that the performance with an improved accuracy can be attained by the proposed control scheme. With the motion tracking capability, the control methodology helps the novel surgical device achieve higher success rate in operation, which is also suitable for similar piezoelectric ultrasonic actuator applications.","",""

Although many approaches have been proposed to enhance the robustness of neural networks, few of them explored robust architectures for neural networks. On this account, we try to address such an issue from the perspective of dynamic system in this work. By viewing ResNet as an explicit Euler discretization of an ordinary differential equation (ODE), for the frst time, we fnd that the adversarial robustness of ResNet is connected to the numerical stability of the corresponding dynamic system, i.e., more stable numerical schemes may correspond to more robust deep networks. Furthermore, inspired by the implicit Euler method for solving numerical ODE problems, we propose Implicit Euler skip connections (IE-Skips) by modifying the original skip connection in ResNet or its variants. Then we theoretically prove its advantages under the adversarial attack and the experimental results show that our ResNet with IE-Skips can largely improve the robustness and the generalization ability under adversarial attacks when compared with the vanilla ResNet of the same parameter size.","",""

It is assumed that all nonlinearities, time-varying delays, and sensor and actuator attacks are unknown. In the concerned problem, since the state information measured by sensors is compromised by additional attack signals, the exact state variables are not available for feedback. Thus, a memoryless adaptive resilient control design using compromised state variables is developed by employing the neural-network-based function approximation technique and designing the attack compensator. The resulting control scheme ensures the robust stabilization in the presence of unknown deception attacks and time-varying delays. It is shown from the Lyapunov stability analysis that all closed-loop signals are uniformly ultimately bounded and the stabilization errors converge to an adjustable neighborhood of the origin.","",""

In the testing phase, the desired Jacobian is arrived at using a robust KF to improve the ENN learning result so as to achieve robotic precise convergence of the desired pose.

The approach is valid for a class of highly uncertain systems with arbitrary but bounded dimension. The problem of trajectory tracking is solved through developing a stable inversion for robot dynamics using only joint angles measurement; then a linear dynamic compensator is utilised to stabilise the tracking error for the nominal system. Furthermore, a high gain observer is designed to provide an estimate for error dynamics. A linear in parameter neural network based adaptive signal is used to approximate and eliminate the effect of uncertainties due to link flexibilities and vibration modes on tracking performance, where the adaptation rule for the neural network weights is derived based on Lyapunov function. The stability and the ultimate boundedness of the error signals and closed-loop system is demonstrated through the Lyapunov stability theory. Computer simulations of the proposed robust controller are carried to validate on a two-link flexible planar manipulator.","",""

Because of the open-loop instability of the EMS system, the current must be actively controlled to maintain the target airgap. However, the maglev system suffers from the strong nonlinearity, force saturation, track flexibility, and feedback signals with network time-delay, hence making the controller design even more difficult. In this article, the minimum levitation unit of the maglev vehicle system has been established. An amplitude saturation controller (ASC), which can ensure the generation of only saturated unidirectional attractive force, is thus proposed. The stability and convergence of the closed-loop signals are proven based on the Lyapunov method. Subsequently, ASC is improved based on the radial basis function neural networks, and a neural network-based supervisor controller (NNBSC) is thus designed. The ASC plays the main role in the initial stage. As the neural network learns the control trend, it will gradually transition to the neural network controller. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the specific merit of the NNBSC.
