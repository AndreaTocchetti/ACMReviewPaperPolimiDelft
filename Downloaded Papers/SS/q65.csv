This state-of-the-art performance offered by DNNs in many Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications has paved their way to being used in several safety-critical applications where even a single failure can lead to catastrophic results. Therefore, improving the robustness of these models to hardware-induced faults (such as soft errors, aging, and manufacturing defects) is of significant importance to avoid any disastrous event. Traditional redundancy-based fault mitigation techniques cannot be employed in a wide of applications due to their high overheads, which, when coupled with the compute-intensive nature of DNNs, lead to undesirable resource consumption. In this article, we present an overview of different low-cost fault-mitigation techniques that exploit the intrinsic characteristics of DNNs to limit their overheads. We discuss how each technique can contribute to the overall resilience of a DNN-based system, and how they can be integrated together to offer resilience against multiple diverse hardware-induced reliability threats. Towards the end, we highlight several key future directions that are envisioned to help in achieving highly dependable DL-based systems.","",""

Motivated by Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) applications, we simulate time- and frequency-selective channels with orthogonal frequency division multiplex (OFDM) and extend our channel models in such a way that a continuous degradation from line-of-sight (LoS) to non-line-of-sight (NLoS) conditions can be emulated. It turns out that the NN-based system cannot just compete with the LMMSE equalizer, but it also can be trained w.r.t. resilience against system parameter mismatch. We thereby showcase the conceptual simplicity of such a data-driven system design, as this not only enables more robustness against, e.g., signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) or Doppler spread estimation mismatches, but also allows to use the same equalizer over a wider range of input parameters without the need of re-building (or re-estimating) the filter coefficients. Particular attention has been paid to ensure compatibility with the existing IEEE 802.11p piloting scheme for V2X communications.

First-order Taylor expansion is used to evaluate the filter/channel-level weight sensitivities of large scale DNNs which accurately approximates weight sensitivities from actual error injection simulations. We also present the heterogeneous multiply-accumulate (MAC) unit based design approach where some of the MAC units are designed larger with shorter critical path delays for robustness to aggressive voltage scaling while other MAC units are designed relatively smaller. The sensitivity variations among filter weights can be leveraged to design DNN accelerator such that the computations with more sensitive weights are assigned to more robust (larger) MAC units while the computations with less sensitive weights are assigned to less robust (smaller) MAC units. Using dynamic programming, the sizes of MAC units are selected to achieve best DNN accuracy under ISO area constraint.

A deeper understanding of the problem could lead to a better comprehension of how information is processed and encoded in neural networks and, more in general, could help to solve the issue of interpretability in machine learning. Our idea to increase adversarial resilience starts with the observation that artificial neurons can be divided in two broad categories: AND-like neurons and OR-like neurons. Intuitively, the former are characterised by a relatively low number of combinations of input values which trigger neuron activation, while for the latter the opposite is true. Our hypothesis is that the presence in a network of a sufficiently high number of OR-like neurons could lead to classification “brittleness” and increase the network’s susceptibility to adversarial attacks. After constructing an operational definition of a neuron AND-like behaviour, we proceed to introduce several measures to increase the proportion of AND-like neurons in the network: L1 norm weight normalisation; application of an input filter; comparison between the neuron output’s distribution obtained when the network is fed with the actual data set and the distribution obtained when the network is fed with a randomised version of the former called “scrambled data set”. Tests performed on the MNIST data set hint that the proposed measures could represent an interesting direction to explore.","",""

The requirement of supporting both latency-sensitive and compute-intensive IoT tasks necessitates service resilience, especially for the broker nodes in typical brokerworker deployment designs. Existing fault-tolerance or resilience schemes often lack robustness and generalization capability in non-stationary workload settings. This is typically due to the expensive periodic fine-tuning of models required to adapt them in dynamic scenarios. To address this, we present a confidence aware resilience model, CAROL, that utilizes a memory-efficient generative neural network to predict the Quality of Service (QoS) for a future state and a confidence score for each prediction. Thus, whenever a broker fails, we quickly recover the system by executing a local-search over the broker-worker topology space and optimize future QoS. The confidence score enables us to keep track of the prediction performance and run parsimonious neural network fine-tuning to avoid excessive overheads, further improving the QoS of the system.

Increasing availability of extensive (big) data is amplifying our ability to quantify biological networks. Similarly, theoretical methods that describe network structure and dynamics are being developed. Beyond static networks representing snapshots of biological systems, collections of longitudinal data series can help either at defining and characterizing network dynamics over time or analyzing the dynamics constrained to networked architectures. Moreover, due to interactions with the environment and other biological systems, a biological network may not be fully observable. Also, subnetworks may emerge and disappear as a result of the need for the biological system to cope with for example invaders or new information flows. The confluence of these developments renders tractable the question of how the structure of biological networks predicts and controls network dynamics. In particular, there may be structural features that result in homeostatic networks with specific higher-order statistics (e.g., multifractal spectrum), which maintain stability over time through robustness and/or resilience to perturbation. Alternative, plastic networks may respond to perturbation by (adaptive to catastrophic) shifts in structure. Here, we explore the opportunity for discovering universal laws connecting the structure of biological networks with their function, positioning them on the spectrum of time-evolving network structure, i.e. dynamics of networks, from highly stable to exquisitely sensitive to perturbation.

When part of the test samples are drawn from a distribution that is sufficiently far away from that of the training samples (a.k.a. out-of-distribution (OOD) samples), the trained neural network has a tendency to make high confidence predictions for these OOD samples. Detection of the OOD samples is critical when training a neural network used for image classification, object detection, etc. It can enhance the classifier’s robustness to irrelevant inputs, and improve the system resilience and security under different forms of attacks. Detection of OOD samples has three main challenges: (i) the proposed OOD detection method should be compatible with various architectures of classifiers (e.g., DenseNet, ResNet), without significantly increasing the model complexity and requirements on computational resources; (ii) the OOD samples may come from multiple distributions, whose class labels are commonly unavailable; (iii) a score function needs to be defined to effectively separate OOD samples from in-distribution (InD) samples. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Wasserstein-based out-of-distribution detection (WOOD) method. The basic idea is to define a Wassersteindistance-based score that evaluates the dissimilarity between a test sample and the distribution of InD samples. An optimization problem is then formulated and solved based on the proposed score function. The statistical learning bound of the proposed method is investigated to guarantee that the loss value achieved by the empirical optimizer approximates the global optimum.

To introduce such control mechanism in a hardware spiking neural network (SNN), we present here a novel artificial neuron based on phase change memory (PCM) devices capable of internal regulation via homeostatic and plastic phenomena. We experimentally show that this mechanism increases the robustness of the system thus optimizing the multi-pattern learning under spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). It also improves the continual learning capability of hybrid supervised-unsupervised convolutional neural networks (CNNs), in terms of both resilience and accuracy. Furthermore, the use of neurons capable of self-regulating their fire responsivity as a function of the PCM internal state enables the design of dynamic networks. In this scenario, we propose to use the PCM-based neurons to design bio-inspired recurrent networks for autonomous decision making in navigation tasks. The agent relies on neuronal spike-frequency adaptation (SFA) to explore the environment via penalties and rewards.

Alterations of these brain networks may highlight important findings concerning the resilience of the brain to different disorders. The focus of this paper is to evaluate the robustness of brain network estimations, discriminate them under anesthesia and compare them to generative models.ApproachThe extraction of brain functional connectivity (FC) networks is difficult and biased due the properties of the data: low signal to noise ratio, high dimension low sample size. We propose to use wavelet correlations to assess FC between brain areas under anesthesia using four anesthetics (isoflurane, etomidate, medetomidine, urethane). The networks are then deduced from the functional connectivity matrices by applying statistical thresholds computed using the number of samples at a given scale of wavelet decomposition. Graph measures are extracted and extensive comparisons with generative models of structured networks are conducted.Main resultsThe sample size and filtering are critical to obtain significant correlations values and thereby detect connections between regions. This is necessary to construct networks different from random ones as shown using rs-fMRI brain networks of dead rats. Brain networks under anesthesia on rats have topological features that are mixing small-world, scale-free and random networks. Betweenness centrality indicates that hubs are present in brain networks obtained from anesthetized rats but locations of these hubs are altered by anesthesia.SignificanceUnderstanding the effects of anesthesia on brain areas is of particular importance in the context of animal research since animal models are commonly used to explore functions, evaluate lesions or illnesses, and test new drugs. More generally, results indicate that the use of correlations in the context of fMRI signals is robust but must be treated with caution. Solutions are proposed in order to control spurious correlations by setting them to zero.","",""

In particular, so-called adversarial examples, constructed from perturbations of input data that are small or imperceptible to humans but lead to different predictions, may lead to an enormous risk in certain critical applications. In light of this, there has been a great deal of work on developing adversarial training strategies to improve model robustness. These training strategies are very expensive, in both human and computational time. To complement these approaches, we propose a very simple and inexpensive strategy which can be used to ``retrofit'' a previously-trained network to improve its resilience to adversarial attacks. More concretely, we propose a new activation function---the JumpReLU---which, when used in place of a ReLU in an already-trained model, leads to a trade-off between predictive accuracy and robustness. This trade-off is controlled by the jump size, a hyper-parameter which can be tuned during the validation stage. Our empirical results demonstrate that this increases model robustness, protecting against adversarial attacks with substantially increased levels of perturbations. This is accomplished simply by retrofitting existing networks with our JumpReLU activation function, without the need for retraining the model. Additionally, we demonstrate that adversarially trained (robust) models can greatly benefit from retrofitting.","",""

Using the spatial, one-pixel, Carlini & Wagner (C&W), and boundary attacks, a traffic-light classification neural network's robustness was evaluated. It was found that the particular model architecture was only really susceptible to the spatial attack (56% decrease in accuracy on perturbed images) and the C&W attack (0% accuracy on perturbed images). Subsequently, two defense strategies were proposed to increase the model's resilience to these attacks. First, the model was trained on a dataset composed of both perturbed and unperturbed images. This significantly helped against the spatial attack (22.5% decrease in success rate). Second, since the C&W attack maintained a 100% success rate, defensive distillation was then implemented. However, this only made the model more susceptible to the C&W attack (same success rate) and the spatial attack (13% increase in success rate). This shows that there is a lot of work that needs to be done to increase the robustness of applied neural networks against adversarial attacks. In summary, for the implemented traffic light CNN, only the spatial and C&W attacks can fool it.

Previous studies have shown production of circular and figure-eight trajectories to be robust after training. This report shows the effects of different sampling rates on the production of trajectories by the ATNN neural network, including the influence of sampling rate on the robustness and noise-resilience of the resulting system. Although fast training occurred with few samples per trajectory, and the trajectory was learned successfully, more resilience to noise was observed when there were higher numbers of samples per trajectory. The effects of changing the initial segments that begin the trajectory generation were evaluated. This evaluation showed that a minimum length of initial segment is required, but that the location of that segment does not influence the trajectory generation, even when different initial segments are used during training and recall. A major conclusion from these results is that the network learns the inherent features of the trajectory rather than memorizing each point. When a recurrent loop was added from the output to the input of the ATNN, the training was shown to result in an attractor of the network for a figure-eight trajectory, which involves more complexity due to crossover compared with previous attractor training of a circular trajectory. Furthermore, when the trajectory length was not a multiple of the sampling interval, the trained network generated intervening points on subsequent repetitions of the trajectory, a feature of limit cycle attractors observed in dynamic networks. Thus, an effective method of training an individual dynamic attractor into a neural network is extended to more complex trajectories and to show the properties of a limit cycle attractor.","",""

This work shows how architectural design decisions, particularly in mapping neural network parameters to analog memory cells, influence inference accuracy. When evaluated using ResNet50 on ImageNet, the resilience of the system to analog non-idealities—cell programming errors, analog-to-digital converter resolution, and array parasitic resistances—all improve when analog quantities in the hardware are made proportional to the weights in the network. Moreover, contrary to the assumptions of prior work, nearly equivalent resilience to cell imprecision can be achieved by fully storing weights as analog quantities, rather than spreading weight bits across multiple devices, often referred to as bit slicing. By exploiting proportionality, analog system designers have the freedom to match the precision of the hardware to the needs of the algorithm, rather than attempting to guarantee the same level of precision in the intermediate results as an equivalent digital accelerator.

The LE-SESs are networked systems composed of a set of connected components including Bayes filters for localisation, and neural networks for processing sensory input. We study LE-SESs from the perspective of formal verification, which determines the satisfiability of a system model against the specified properties. Over LE-SESs, we investigate two key properties - robustness and resilience - and provide their formal definitions. To enable formal verification, we reduce the LE-SESs to a novel class of labelled transition systems, named {PO}2-LTS in the paper, and formally express the properties as constrained optimisation objectives. We prove that the robustness verification is NP-complete. Based on {PO}2-LTS and the optimisation objectives, practical verification algorithms are developed to check the satisfiability of the properties on the LE-SESs. As a major case study, we interrogate a real-world dynamic tracking system which uses a single Kalman Filter (KF) - a special case of Bayes filter - to localise and track a ground vehicle. Its perception system, based on convolutional neural networks, processes a high-resolution Wide Area Motion Imagery (WAMI) data stream. Experimental results show that our algorithms can not only verify the properties of the WAMI tracking system but also provide representative examples, the latter of which inspired us to take an enhanced LE-SESs design where runtime monitors or joint-KFs are required. Experimental results confirm the improvement of the robustness of the enhanced design.","",""

Clinical exams are typically poorly temporally characterized, as seen in a low temporal resolution (LTR) compared to high temporal resolution (HTR) experimental acquisitions. Meanwhile, clinical demands incentivize shortening these exams. This study develops a neural network based approach to quantification of k1 , for increased robustness over current models such as the linearized single-input, two-compartment (LSITC) model.   METHODS 30 Liver HTR DCE MRI exams were acquired in 22 patients with at least 16 minutes of post-contrast data sampled at least every 13 seconds. A simple neural network (NN) with 4 hidden layers was trained on voxel-wise LTR data to predict k1 . LTR data was created by subsampling HTR data to contain 6 time points, replicating the characteristics of clinical LTR data. Both the total length and the placement of points in the training data was varied considerably to encourage robustness to variation. A GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) was used to generate arterial and portal venous inputs for use in data augmentation based on the dual-input, two-compartment, pharmacokinetic model of gadoxetic acid in the liver. The performance of the NN was compared to direct application of LSITC on both LTR and HTR data. The error was assessed when subsampling lengths from 16 to 4 minutes, enabling assessment of robustness to acquisition length.   RESULTS For acquisition lengths of 16 min NRMSE (Normalized Root-Mean-Squared Error) in k1 was 0.60, 1.77, and 1.21, for LSITC applied to HTR data, LSITC applied to LTR data, and GAN augmented NN applied to LTR data, respectively. As the acquisition length was shortened, errors greatly increased for LSITC approaches by several folds. For acquisitions shorter than 12 minutes the GAN augmented NN approach outperformed the LSITC approach to a statistically significant extent, even with HTR data.   CONCLUSIONS The study indicates that data length is significant for LSITC analysis as applied to DCE data for standard temporal sampling, and that machine learning methods, such as the implemented NN, have potential for much greater resilience to shortened acquisition time than directly fitting to the LSITC model.","",""

The proposed CNN model, namely EEG-inception, is built on the backbone of the inception-time network, which has showed to be highly efficient and accurate for time-series classification. Also, the proposed network is an end-to-end classification, as it takes the raw EEG signals as the input and does not require complex EEG signal-preprocessing. Furthermore, this paper proposes a novel data augmentation method for EEG signals to enhance the accuracy, at least by 3%, and reduce overfitting with limited BCI datasets. Main results. The proposed model outperforms all state-of-the-art methods by achieving the average accuracy of 88.4% and 88.6% on the 2008 BCI Competition IV 2a (four-classes) and 2b datasets (binary-classes), respectively.

We found that the transition to seizure is not a sudden phenomenon, but is instead a slow process that is characterized by the progressive loss of neuronal network resilience. From a dynamical perspective, the slow transition is governed by the principles of critical slowing, a robust natural phenomenon that is observable in systems characterized by transitions between dynamical regimes. In epilepsy, this process is modulated by synchronous synaptic input from IEDs. The IEDs are external perturbations that produce phasic changes in the slow transition process and exert opposing effects on the dynamics of a seizure-generating network, causing either antiseizure or proseizure effects. We found that the multifaceted nature of IEDs is defined by the dynamical state of the network at the moment of the discharge occurrence.","",""

Therefore, in this article, we propose a novel DeepOC neural network, termed as DeepOC, which can simultaneously learn compact feature representations and train a DeepOC classifier. Only with the given normal samples, we use the stacked convolutional encoder to generate their low-dimensional high-level features and train a one-class classifier to make these features as compact as possible. Meanwhile, for the sake of the correct mapping relation and the feature representations’ diversity, we utilize a decoder in order to reconstruct raw samples from these low-dimensional feature representations. This structure is gradually established using an adversarial mechanism during the training stage. This mechanism is the key to our model. It organically combines two seemingly contradictory components and allows them to take advantage of each other, thus making the model robust and effective. Unlike methods that use handcrafted features or those that are separated into two stages (extracting features and training classifiers), DeepOC is a one-stage model using reliable features that are automatically extracted by neural networks.

However, various working requirements and the oceanic environment may cause some uncertain and unfavorable factors for ship-mounted crane control. In particular, to accomplish different control tasks, some plant parameters (e.g., boom lengths, payload masses, and so on) frequently change; hence, most existing model-based controllers cannot ensure satisfactory control performance any longer. For example, inaccurate gravity compensation may result in positioning errors. Additionally, due to ship roll motions caused by sea waves, residual payload swing generally exists, which may result in safety risks in practice.

Soft errors caused by high-energy particles have been increasing in hardware systems, and these can lead to catastrophic failures in DNN systems. Traditional methods for building resilient systems, e.g., Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR), are agnostic of the DNN algorithm and the DNN accelerator's architecture. Hence, these traditional resilience approaches incur high overheads, which makes them challenging to deploy. In this paper, we experimentally evaluate the resilience characteristics of DNN systems (i.e., DNN software running on specialized accelerators). We find that the error resilience of a DNN system depends on the data types, values, data reuses, and types of layers in the design. Based on our observations, we propose two efficient protection techniques for DNN systems.","",""

The neural circuitry underlying locomotion is therefore highly robust to a wide variety of perturbations, including injury and abrupt changes in the environment. In the short term, fault tolerance in neural networks allows locomotion to persist immediately after mild to moderate injury. In the longer term, in many invertebrates and vertebrates, neural reorganization including anatomical regeneration can restore locomotion after severe perturbations that initially caused paralysis. Despite decades of research, very little is known about the mechanisms underlying locomotor resilience at the level of the underlying neural circuits and coordination of central pattern generators (CPGs). Undulatory locomotion is an ideal behaviour for exploring principles of circuit organization, neural control and resilience of locomotion, offering a number of unique advantages including experimental accessibility and modelling tractability. In comparing three well‐characterized undulatory swimmers, lampreys, larval zebrafish and Caenorhabditis elegans, we find similarities in the manifestation of locomotor resilience. To advance our understanding, we propose a comparative approach, integrating experimental and modelling studies, that will allow the field to begin identifying shared and distinct solutions for overcoming perturbations to persist in orchestrating this essential behaviour.","",""

Methods Self-consistent robust artificial-neural-networks for k-space interpolation (sRAKI) performs iterative parallel imaging reconstruction by enforcing self-consistency among coils. The approach bears similarity to SPIRiT, but extends the linear convolutions in SPIRiT to nonlinear interpolation using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). These CNNs are trained individually for each scan using the scan-specific autocalibrating signal (ACS) data. Reconstruction is performed by imposing the learned self-consistency and data-consistency, which enables sRAKI to support random undersampling patterns. Fully-sampled targeted right coronary artery MRI was acquired in six healthy subjects. The data were retrospectively undersampled, and reconstructed using SPIRiT, l1-SPIRiT and sRAKI for acceleration rates of 2 to 5. Additionally, prospectively undersampled whole-heart coronary MRI was acquired to further evaluate reconstruction performance. Results sRAKI reduces noise amplification and blurring artifacts compared with SPIRiT and l1-SPIRiT, especially at high acceleration rates in targeted coronary MRI. Quantitative analysis shows that sRAKI outperforms these techniques in terms of normalized mean-squared-error (~44% and ~21% over SPIRiT and l1-SPIRiT at rate 5) and vessel sharpness (~10% and ~20% over SPIRiT and l1-SPIRiT at rate 5). Whole-heart data shows the sharpest coronary arteries when resolved using sRAKI, with 11% and 15% improvement in vessel sharpness over SPIRiT and l1-SPIRiT, respectively. Conclusion sRAKI is a database-free neural network-based reconstruction technique that may further accelerate coronary MRI with arbitrary undersampling patterns, while improving noise resilience over linear parallel imaging and image sharpness over l1 regularization techniques.","",""

Existing recognition methods rely on a threshold technique, which is difficult to realize high accuracy, i.e., simultaneously high true positive rate and low false positive rate. To address this issue, we proposed a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect IC and NC states in a SSVEP-BCI system for the first time. Specifically, the steady-state motion visual evoked potentials (SSMVEP) paradigm, which has been shown to induce less visual discomfort, was chosen as the experimental paradigm. Two processing pipelines were proposed for the detection of IC and NC states. The first one was using CNN as a multi-class classifier to discriminate between all the states in IC and NC state (FFT-CNN). The second one was using CNN to discriminate between IC and NC states, and using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to perform classification tasks within the IC (FFT-CNN-CCA). We demonstrated that both pipelines achieved a significant increase in accuracy for low-performance healthy participants when traditional algorithms such as CCA threshold were used. Furthermore, the FFT-CNN-CCA pipeline achieved better performance than the FFT-CNN pipeline based on the stroke patients’ data.

The origin of this variability is uncertain, but it is usually interpreted as detrimental noise that reduces the computational accuracy of neural circuits. Here we investigate the possibility that such response variability might in fact be beneficial, because it may partially compensate for a decrease in accuracy due to stochastic changes in the synaptic strengths of a network. We study the interplay between two kinds of noise, response (or neuronal) noise and synaptic noise, by analyzing their joint influence on the accuracy of neural networks trained to perform various tasks. We find an interesting, generic interaction: when fluctuations in the synaptic connections are proportional to their strengths (multiplicative noise), a certain amount of response noise in the input neurons can significantly improve network performance, compared to the same network without response noise. Performance is enhanced because response noise and multiplicative synaptic noise are in some ways equivalent. So if the algorithm used to find the optimal synaptic weights can take into account the variability of the model neurons, it can also take into account the variability of the synapses. Thus, the connection patterns generated with response noise are typically more resistant to synaptic degradation than those obtained without response noise. As a consequence of this interplay, if multiplicative synaptic noise is present, it is better to have response noise in the network than not to have it. These results are demonstrated analytically for the most basic network consisting of two input neurons and one output neuron performing a simple classification task, but computer simulations show that the phenomenon persists in a wide range of architectures, including recurrent (attractor) networks and sensorimotor networks that perform coordinate transformations. The results suggest that response variability could play an important dynamic role in networks that continuously learn.","",""

Small perturbations to sensor inputs (from noise or adversarial examples) are often enough to change network-based decisions, which was recently shown to cause an autonomous vehicle to swerve into another lane. In light of these dangers, numerous algorithms have been developed as defensive mechanisms from these adversarial inputs, some of which provide formal robustness guarantees or certificates. This work leverages research on certified adversarial robustness to develop an online certifiably robust for deep reinforcement learning algorithms. The proposed defense computes guaranteed lower bounds on state-action values during execution to identify and choose a robust action under a worst case deviation in input space due to possible adversaries or noise. Moreover, the resulting policy comes with a certificate of solution quality, even though the true state and optimal action are unknown to the certifier due to the perturbations. The approach is demonstrated on a deep Q-network (DQN) policy and is shown to increase robustness to noise and adversaries in pedestrian collision avoidance scenarios, a classic control task, and Atari Pong.

The comparative study was carried out using a biological 2-layer SNN trained with an unsupervised spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) algorithm. Various aspects of network performance were considered, including classification accuracy, processing latency, synaptic operations (SOPs), hardware implementation, network compression efficacy, input and synaptic noise resilience, and synaptic fault tolerance. The classification tasks on Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) and Fashion-MNIST datasets were applied in our study. For hardware implementation, area and power consumption were estimated for these coding schemes, and the network compression efficacy was analyzed using pruning and quantization techniques. Different types of input noise and noise variations in the datasets were considered and applied. Furthermore, the robustness of each coding scheme to the non-ideality-induced synaptic noise and fault in analog neuromorphic systems was studied and compared. Our results show that TTFS coding is the best choice in achieving the highest computational performance with very low hardware implementation overhead. TTFS coding requires 4x/7.5x lower processing latency and 3.5x/6.5x fewer SOPs than rate coding during the training/inference process. Phase coding is the most resilient scheme to input noise. Burst coding offers the highest network compression efficacy and the best overall robustness to hardware non-idealities for both training and inference processes.

We show the model is able to continuously learn a large number of variable order temporal sequences using an unsupervised Hebbian-like learning rule. The sparse temporal codes formed by the model can robustly handle branching temporal sequences by maintaining multiple predictions until there is sufficient disambiguating evidence. We compare the HTM sequence memory with other sequence learning algorithms, including statistical methods—autoregressive integrated moving average; feedforward neural networks—time delay neural network and online sequential extreme learning machine; and recurrent neural networks—long short-term memory and echo-state networks on sequence prediction problems with both artificial and real-world data. The HTM model achieves comparable accuracy to other state-of-the-art algorithms. The model also exhibits properties that are critical for sequence learning, including continuous online learning, the ability to handle multiple predictions and branching sequences with high-order statistics, robustness to sensor noise and fault tolerance, and good performance without task-specific hyperparameter tuning. Therefore, the HTM sequence memory not only advances our understanding of how the brain may solve the sequence learning problem but is also applicable to real-world sequence learning problems from continuous data streams.","",""

We aim to penalize the too complicated RNN-LM by compensating for the uncertainty of the estimated model parameters, which is represented by a Gaussian prior. The objective function in a Bayesian classification network is formed as the regularized cross-entropy error function. The regularized model is constructed not only by calculating the regularized parameters according to the maximum a posteriori criterion but also by estimating the Gaussian hyperparameter by maximizing the marginal likelihood. A rapid approximation to a Hessian matrix is developed to implement the Bayesian RNN-LM (BRNN-LM) by selecting a small set of salient outer-products. The proposed BRNN-LM achieves a sparser model than the RNN-LM. Experiments on different corpora show the robustness of system performance by applying the rapid BRNN-LM under different conditions.","",""

In biological vision systems, scientists have found that specific types of visual neurons have specific preferences to each of the three motion elements. There are computational models on translation and expansion/contraction perceptions; however, little has been done in the past to create computational models for rotational motion perception. To fill this gap, we proposed a neural network that utilizes a specific spatiotemporal arrangement of asymmetric lateral inhibited direction selective neural networks (DSNNs) for rotational motion perception. The proposed neural network consists of two parts—presynaptic and postsynaptic parts. In the presynaptic part, there are a number of lateral inhibited DSNNs to extract directional visual cues. In the postsynaptic part, similar to the arrangement of the directional columns in the cerebral cortex, these direction selective neurons are arranged in a cyclic order to perceive rotational motion cues. In the postsynaptic network, the delayed excitation from each direction selective neuron is multiplied by the gathered excitation from this neuron and its unilateral counterparts depending on which rotation, clockwise (cw) or counter-cw (ccw), to perceive. Systematic experiments under various conditions and settings have been carried out and validated the robustness and reliability of the proposed neural network in detecting cw or ccw rotational motion.

It is known that the disadvantages of robust control for the NARMA model are as follows: 1) suitable control parameters for larger time delay are more sensitive to achieving desirable performance; 2) it only deals with bounded uncertainty; and 3) the nominal NARMA model must be learned in advance. Due to the dynamic feature of the NARMA model, a recurrent neural network (RNN) is online applied to learn it. However, the system performance becomes deteriorated due to the poor learning of the larger variation of system vector functions. In this situation, a simple network is employed to compensate the upper bound of the residue caused by the linear parameterization of the approximation error of RNN. An e-modification learning law with a projection for weight matrix is applied to guarantee its boundedness without persistent excitation. Under suitable conditions, the semiglobally ultimately bounded tracking with the boundedness of estimated weight matrix is obtained by the proposed RNN-based multivariable adaptive control.

Such attacks can seriously undermine the security of the system supported by the DNN, sometimes with devastating consequences. For example, autonomous vehicles can be crashed, illicit or illegal content can bypass content filters, or biometric authentication systems can be manipulated to allow improper access. In this work, we introduce a defensive mechanism called defensive distillation to reduce the effectiveness of adversarial samples on DNNs. We analytically investigate the generalizability and robustness properties granted by the use of defensive distillation when training DNNs. We also empirically study the effectiveness of our defense mechanisms on two DNNs placed in adversarial settings. The study shows that defensive distillation can reduce effectiveness of sample creation from 95% to less than 0.5% on a studied DNN. Such dramatic gains can be explained by the fact that distillation leads gradients used in adversarial sample creation to be reduced by a factor of 1030. We also find that distillation increases the average minimum number of features that need to be modified to create adversarial samples by about 800% on one of the DNNs we tested.","",""

Hardware accelerators such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are a promising solution that can satisfy these requirements for both embedded and High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems. In FPGAs, as well as CPUs and GPUs, aggressive voltage scaling below the nominal level is an effective technique for power dissipation minimization. Unfortunately, bit-flip faults start to appear as the voltage is scaled down closer to the transistor threshold due to timing issues, thus creating a resilience issue.This paper experimentally evaluates the resilience of the training phase of DNNs in the presence of voltage underscaling related faults of FPGAs, especially in on-chip memories. Toward this goal, we have experimentally evaluated the resilience of LeNet-5 and also a specially designed network for CIFAR-10 dataset with different activation functions of Rectified Linear Unit (Relu) and Hyperbolic Tangent (Tanh). We have found that modern FPGAs are robust enough in extremely low-voltage levels and that low-voltage related faults can be automatically masked within the training iterations, so there is no need for costly software-or hardware-oriented fault mitigation techniques like ECC. Approximately 10% more training iterations are needed to fill the gap in the accuracy. This observation is the result of the relatively low rate of undervolting faults, i.e., <0.1%, measured on real FPGA fabrics. We have also increased the fault rate significantly for the LeNet-5 network by randomly generated fault injection campaigns and observed that the training accuracy starts to degrade. When the fault rate increases, the network with Tanh activation function outperforms the one with Relu in terms of accuracy, e.g., when the fault rate is 30% the accuracy difference is 4.92%.","",""

It can even memorize randomly labeled data, which has little knowledge behind the instance-label pairs. When a deep network continually learns over time by accommodating new tasks, it usually quickly overwrites the knowledge learned from previous tasks. Referred to as the neural variability, it is well known in neuroscience that human brain reactions exhibit substantial variability even in response to the same stimulus. This mechanism balances accuracy and plasticity/flexibility in the motor learning of natural nervous systems. Thus, it motivates us to design a similar mechanism, named artificial neural variability (ANV), that helps artificial neural networks learn some advantages from “natural” neural networks. We rigorously prove that ANV plays as an implicit regularizer of the mutual information between the training data and the learned model. This result theoretically guarantees ANV a strictly improved generalizability, robustness to label noise, and robustness to catastrophic forgetting. We then devise a neural variable risk minimization (NVRM) framework and neural variable optimizers to achieve ANV for conventional network architectures in practice. The empirical studies demonstrate that NVRM can effectively relieve overfitting, label noise memorization, and catastrophic forgetting at negligible costs.","",""

Here we advance a new hypothesis, based on the notion of programmability and an interpreter-programmer computational scheme, on how the PFC can flexibly bias the selection of sensorimotor patterns depending on internal goal and task contexts. In this approach, multiple elementary behaviors representing motor primitives are expressed by a single multi-purpose neural network, which is seen as a reusable area of ""recycled"" neurons (interpreter). The PFC thus acts as a ""programmer"" that, without modifying the network connectivity, feeds the interpreter networks with specific input parameters encoding the programs (corresponding to network structures) to be interpreted by the (pre-)motor areas. Our architecture is validated in a standard test for executive function: the 1-2-AX task.

The neural circuit behaviors used are similar to those associated with brain neural integrators. In the larger context described here, this kind of circuit becomes a building block of an entirely different computational algorithm for solving complex problems. While the network behavior is simulated in detail, a collective view is essential to understanding the results. A closed equation of motion for the collective variable describes an algorithm that quantitatively accounts for many aspects of the emergent network computation.

However, it is a long-standing challenging problem for artificial agents. Cognitive autonomous robots coping with this problem must solve two essential tasks: 1) understand the environment in terms of what may happen and how I can deal with this and 2) learn successful experiences for their further use in an automatic subconscious way. The recently introduced concept of compact internal representation (CIR) provides the ground for both the tasks. CIR is a specific cognitive map that compacts time-evolving situations into static structures containing information necessary for navigation. It belongs to the class of global approaches, i.e., it finds trajectories to a target when they exist but also detects situations when no solution can be found. Here we extend the concept of situations with mobile targets. Then using CIR as a core, we propose a closed-loop neural network architecture consisting of conscious and subconscious pathways for efficient decision-making. The conscious pathway provides solutions to novel situations if the default subconscious pathway fails to guide the agent to a target. Employing experiments with roving robots and numerical simulations, we show that the proposed architecture provides the robot with cognitive abilities and enables reliable and flexible navigation in realistic time-evolving environments. We prove that the subconscious pathway is robust against uncertainty in the sensory information. Thus if a novel situation is similar but not identical to the previous experience (because of, e.g., noisy perception) then the subconscious pathway is able to provide an effective solution.","",""

We reproduce this simplification process using a neural network to build a low dimensional state representation of the world from images acquired by a robot. As in Jonschkowski et al. 2015, we learn in an unsupervised way using prior knowledge about the world as loss functions called robotic priors and extend this approach to high dimension richer images to learn a 3D representation of the hand position of a robot from RGB images. We propose a quantitative evaluation metric of the learned representation that uses nearest neighbors in the state space and allows to assess its quality and show both the potential and limitations of robotic priors in realistic environments. We augment image size, add distractors and domain randomization, all crucial components to achieve transfer learning to real robots. Finally, we also contribute a new prior to improve the robustness of the representation. The applications of such low dimensional state representation range from easing reinforcement learning (RL) and knowledge transfer across tasks, to facilitating learning from raw data with more efficient and compact high level representations. The results show that the robotic prior approach is able to extract high level representation as the 3D position of an arm and organize it into a compact and coherent space of states in a challenging dataset.","",""

A complex-valued QP problem is generated if its variable vector is composed of the magnitude and phase information, which is often depicted in a time-dependent form. Given the important role that complex-valued problems play in cybernetics and engineering, computational models with high accuracy and strong robustness are urgently needed, especially for time-dependent problems. However, the research on the online solution of time-dependent complex-valued problems has been much less investigated compared to time-dependent real-valued problems. In this article, to solve the online time-dependent complex-valued QP problems subject to linear constraints, two new discrete-time neural dynamics models, which can achieve global convergence performance in the presence of perturbations with the provided theoretical analyses, are proposed and investigated. In addition, the second proposed model is developed to eliminate the operation of explicit matrix inversion by introducing the quasi-Newton Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS) method. Moreover, computer simulation results and applications in robotics and filters are provided to illustrate the feasibility and superiority of the proposed models in comparison with the existing solutions.","",""

In this paper, we explore the ability of a simplified type of RNN, one with limited modifications to the internal weights called an echostate network (ESN), to effectively and continuously decode monkey reaches during a standard center-out reach task using a cortical brain-machine interface (BMI) in a closed loop. We demonstrate that the RNN, an ESN implementation termed a FORCE decoder (from first order reduced and controlled error learning), learns the task quickly and significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art method, the velocity Kalman filter (VKF), using the measure of target acquire time. We also demonstrate that the FORCE decoder generalizes to a more difficult task by successfully operating the BMI in a randomized point-to-point task. The FORCE decoder is also robust as measured by the success rate over extended sessions. Finally, we show that decoded cursor dynamics are more like naturalistic hand movements than those of the VKF. Taken together, these results suggest that RNNs in general, and the FORCE decoder in particular, are powerful tools for BMI decoder applications.","",""

Due to their outstanding computational capabilities, ANNs have become appealing solutions for safety-critical systems as well. Frequently, they are considered intrinsically robust and fault tolerant for being brain-inspired and redundant computing models. However, when ANNs are deployed on resource-constrained hardware devices, single physical faults may compromise the activity of multiple neurons. Therefore, it is crucial to assess the reliability of the entire neural computing system, including both the software and the hardware components. This article systematically addresses reliability concerns for ANNs running on multiprocessor system-on-a-chips (MPSoCs). It presents a methodology to assign resilience scores to individual neurons and, based on that, schedule the workload of an ANN on the target MPSoC so that critical neurons are neatly distributed among the available processing elements. This reliability-oriented methodology exploits an integer linear programming solver to find the optimal solution. Experimental results are given for three different convolutional neural networks trained on MNIST, SVHN, and CIFAR-10. We carried out a comprehensive assessment on an open-source artificial intelligence-based RISC-V MPSoC. The results show the reliability improvements of the proposed methodology against the traditional scheduling.","",""
