To enhance learning ability of neural network models, the autoencoder method is used as a powerful tool to achieve deep learning and has gained success in recent years. However, the performance of existing autoencoder approaches for manipulator control may be still largely dependent on the quality of data, and for extreme cases with noisy data it may even fail. How to incorporate the model knowledge into the autoencoder controller design with an aim to increase the robustness and reliability remains a challenging problem. In this work, a sparse autoencoder controller for kinematic control of manipulators with weights obtained directly from the robot model rather than training data is proposed for the first time. By encoding and decoding the control target though a new dynamic recurrent neural network architecture, the control input can be solved through a new sparse optimization formulation. In this work, input saturation, which holds for almost all practical systems but usually is ignored for analysis simplicity, is also considered in the controller construction. Theoretical analysis and extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed sparse autoencoder controller with input saturation can make the end-effector of the manipulator system track the desired path efficiently. Further performance comparison and evaluation against the additive noise and parameter uncertainty substantiate robustness of the proposed sparse autoencoder manipulator controller.","",""

The fragility is due to the fact that distillation does not retain the watermark embedded in the model that is redundant and independent to the main learning task. We design ingrain in response to the destructive distillation. It regularizes a neural network with an ingrainer model, which contains the watermark, and forces the model to also represent the knowledge of the ingrainer.

With the knowledge of a collaborative filtering algorithm and its parameters, the performance of this recommendation system can be easily downgraded. Unfortunately, this problem is not addressed well, and the study on defending recommendation systems is insufficient.

Adversarial augmentation contains two neural network modules that are trained jointly and competitively in an adversarial manner, where a generator network mixes different corrupted images to confuse a pose estimator, improving the robustness of the pose estimator by learning from harder samples. To compensate for the noise patterns by adversarial augmentation, knowledge distillation is applied to transfer clean pose structure knowledge to the target pose estimator.

This dissertation presents several classes of composite neural networks which are trained to provide appealing solutions to the problem of knowledge acquisition. The value of the network parameters, after sufficient training, are then utilized to generate production rules on the basis of preselected meaningful coordinates. Neural networks are attracting a lot of interest in the scientific community because of their dynamical nature: robustness, capability of generalization and fault tolerance. Neural networks have already proven useful in low level information processing (e.g. signal analysis). However, an apparent disadvantage of traditional neural networks (i.e. backpropagation networks) is that they do not provide explanations of their response i.e. explicit rules or logical reasoning processes. The classes of composite neural networks studied in this dissertation integrate the paradigm of neural networks with the rule-based approach, rendering them more useful than either. It is shown that the composite neural networks act as Bayesian classifiers, and more importantly, can provide density estimates of the class variables. The dissertation provides a mathematical framework for achieving reasonable generalization properties of composite neural networks serving as universal approximators via an appropriate training algorithm (supervised decision-directed learning). The algorithm is based on an approach that divides the input (feature) space into proper subsets (e.g. hyperspheres, hyperrectangles, or hyperellipsoids), represented as portions of the trained composite neural networks, while the complete structures provide acceptable knowledge representations of the data.  The new concepts and methods presented in the dissertation are illustrated via two traditional academic pattern recognition examples and one practical example from medical diagnosis. These examples are discussed in detail. Finally the dissertation concludes with a summary of the most important results accomplished and with brief recommendation for future work.","",""

We observe that the main reason for the existence of such perturbations is the close proximity of different class samples in the learned feature space. This allows model decisions to be totally changed by adding an imperceptible perturbation in the inputs. To counter this, we propose to class-wise disentangle the intermediate feature representations of deep networks. Specifically, we force the features for each class to lie inside a convex polytope that is maximally separated from the polytopes of other classes. In this manner, the network is forced to learn distinct and distant decision regions for each class. We observe that this simple constraint on the features greatly enhances the robustness of learned models, even against the strongest white-box attacks, without degrading the classification performance on clean images. We report extensive evaluations in both black-box and white-box attack scenarios and show significant gains in comparison to state-of-the art defenses.","",""

When faced with challenging scenes such as large-scale environments, dynamic objects, motion blur caused by fast movement, night-time environments, or other appearance changed scenes, most existing methods tend to fail. This paper introduces deep learning into the indoor relocalization problem and uses dual-stream CNN (depth stream and color stream) to realize 6-DOF pose regression in an end-to-end manner. The localization error is about 0.3 m and 4° in a large-scale indoor environments. And what is more important, the proposed system does not lose efficiency in some challenging scenes. The proposed encoding method of depth images can also be adopted in other deep neural networks with RGB-D cameras as the sensor.","",""

Machine learning techniques may enable the UAS to improve its control accuracy during operation and to respond to unknown, non-linear flight conditions. Here, artificial neural networks (ANN) are used to implement a learning flight control system. This is realised with a systematic two-stage approach by firstly implementing a sustainable offline-trained basic knowledge and improving these characteristics during flight. In the automated offline-step large groups of neural control elements are trained with the required behaviour, which is derived from measured data. This phase showed that the necessary learning task can be achieved by multi-layered feedforward-networks. The training success of all networks regarding generalisation capabilities and robustness is then evaluated with statistical methods and networks are selected for online application. The online learning step is realised with a controller architecture comprising a neural network controller and a neural observer which predicts the system’s dynamics and delivers the quality signal for contoller training. An important element of the control strategy is to determine a consistent error signal for online training of the neural controller. This is done by backpropagation of a measured error through the inverse dynamics of the observer network. Since the inverse dynamics have to be precise in order to train the controller adequately a stable network training algorithm is derived from the field sliding mode control (SMC), which significantly improves the observer’s charcteristics. In summary, the statisical analysis of the robustness of the basic knowledge as well as the implementation of a stable neural predictor into the control process proved to be central aspects of the control strategy.","",""

Inspired by this, we propose an accurate and robust approach, referred to as Latent HyperNet (LHN). The LHN uses feature maps from early layers (hyper) and projects them, individually, onto a low dimensionality (latent) space. Then, these latent features are concatenated and presented to a classifier. To demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of the LHN, we evaluate it using four different network architectures in five publicly available HAR datasets based on wearable sensors, which vary in the sampling rate and number of activities. We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed LHN is able to capture rich information, improving the results regarding the original ConvNets. Furthermore, the method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, on average, by 5.1 percentage points.","",""

They pose the following limitations: requiring a priori knowledge of victim models, lacking in robustness and generality, or obtaining incomplete information of the victim model architecture. Our paper proposes DeepSniffer, a learning-based model extraction framework to obtain the complete model architecture information without any prior knowledge of the victim model. It is robust to architectural and system noises introduced by the complex memory hierarchy and diverse run-time system optimizations. The basic idea of DeepSniffer is to learn the relation between extracted architectural hints (e.g., volumes of memory reads/writes obtained by side-channel or bus snooping attacks) and model internal architectures. Taking GPU platforms as a show case, DeepSniffer conducts model extraction by learning both the architecture-level execution features of kernels and the inter-layer temporal association information introduced by the common practice of DNN design. We demonstrate that DeepSniffer works experimentally in the context of an off-the-shelf Nvidia GPU platform running a variety of DNN models. The extracted models are directly helpful to the attempting of crafting adversarial inputs. Our experimental results show that DeepSniffer achieves a high accuracy of model extraction and thus improves the adversarial attack success rate from 14.6%$\sim$25.5% (without network architecture knowledge) to 75.9% (with extracted network architecture).

This allows the model decisions to be completely changed by adding an imperceptible perturbation to the inputs. To counter this, we propose to class-wise disentangle the intermediate feature representations of deep networks, specifically forcing the features for each class to lie inside a convex polytope that is maximally separated from the polytopes of other classes. In this manner, the network is forced to learn distinct and distant decision regions for each class. We observe that this simple constraint on the features greatly enhances the robustness of learned models, even against the strongest white-box attacks, without degrading the classification performance on clean images.

ELM is suitable for an SOC estimation since the ELM algorithm has fast estimation speed, good generalization performance, and high accuracy. However, the performance of ELM is highly dependent on training accuracy and the number of neurons in a hidden layer. Hence, a gravitational search algorithm (GSA) is applied to improve the ELM computational intelligence by searching for the optimal value hidden layer neurons. The optimal ELM-based GSA model does not require internal battery knowledge and mathematical model for an SOC estimation. The model robustness is validated at different temperatures using different electric vehicle drive cycles. The performance of the ELM-GSA model is verified with two popular neural network methods: back-propagation neural network (BPNN) and radial basis function neural network (RBFNN). The results are evaluated using different error rates and computation costs. The results demonstrate that the ELM-based GSA model offers a higher accuracy and lower SOC error rate than those of BPNN-based GSA and RBFNN-based GSA models.

In particular, the state-of-the-art salient object detection methods enjoy high accuracy and efficiency from fully convolutional network (FCN)-based frameworks which are trained from end to end and predict pixel-wise labels. However, such framework suffers from adversarial attacks which confuse neural networks via adding quasi-imperceptible noises to input images without changing the ground truth annotated by human subjects. To our knowledge, this paper is the first one that mounts successful adversarial attacks on salient object detection models and verifies that adversarial samples are effective on a wide range of existing methods. Furthermore, this paper proposes a novel end-to-end trainable framework to enhance the robustness for arbitrary FCN-based salient object detection models against adversarial attacks. The proposed framework adopts a novel idea that first introduces some new generic noise to destroy adversarial perturbations, and then learns to predict saliency maps for input images with the introduced noise. Specifically, our proposed method consists of a segment-wise shielding component, which preserves boundaries and destroys delicate adversarial noise patterns and a context-aware restoration component, which refines saliency maps through global contrast modeling. The experimental results suggest that our proposed framework improves the performance significantly for state-of-the-art models on a series of datasets.","",""

Moreover, a parallel deep reinforcement learning approach is also presented to improve the robustness of planning model and reduce the error rate. To handle emergency situations, a hybrid generative model including a variational auto-encoder ( VAE ) and a generative adversarial network ( GAN ) is utilized to learn from virtual emergencies generated in artificial traffic scenes. While an autonomous vehicle is moving, the hybrid generative model generates multiple video clips in parallel, which correspond to different potential emergency scenarios.

In this paper, we propose a deep neural network (DNN) for representation learning to predict image quality using very limited knowledge. Driven by the primary target of biometric quality assessment, i.e., verification error minimization, we assume that low-quality images are falsely rejected in a verification system. Based on this assumption, the low- and high-quality images are labeled automatically. We then train a DNN on the resulting data set to predict the image quality.

The deepest layers associated with the patches form together a complementary and an over-complete representation. Subsequently, the quality of each patch from a testing image is estimated and the quality scores from the image patches are conjointly input to probabilistic support vector machines (P-SVM) to boost quality-assessment performance.

The dynamical and kinematical model for the coaxial eight-rotor UAV is developed, which has never been proposed before. A robust backstepping sliding mode controller (BSMC) with adaptive radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) is proposed to control the attitude of the eight-rotor UAV in the presence of model uncertainties and external disturbances. The combinative method of backstepping control and sliding mode control has improved robustness and simplified design procedure benefiting from the advantages of both controllers. The adaptive RBFNN as the uncertainty observer can effectively estimate the lumped uncertainties without the knowledge of their bounds for the eight-rotor UAV. Additionally, the adaptive learning algorithm, which can learn the parameters of RBFNN online and compensate the approximation error, is derived using Lyapunov stability theorem. And then the uniformly ultimate stability of the eight-rotor system is proved. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the validity of the proposed robust control method adopted in the novel coaxial eight-rotor UAV in the case of model uncertainties and external disturbances.","",""

Our final representation is completely binary. We test our approach on MNIST, CIFAR10, and ILSVRC2012 dataset, and systematically study the training dynamics of the binarization process. Our approach can binarize the last layer representation without loss of performance and binarize all the layers with reasonably small degradations. The memory space that it saves may allow more sophisticated models to be deployed, thus compensating the loss. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to report results on current deep network architectures using complete binary middle representations. Given the learned representations, we find that the firing or inhibition of a binary neuron is usually associated with a meaningful interpretation across different classes. This suggests that the semantic structure of a neural network may be manifested through a guided binarization process.","",""

Consequently, the CRNN is physically interpretable such that the reaction pathways can be interpreted, and the kinetic parameters can be quantified simultaneously from the weights of the neural network. The inference of the chemical pathways is accomplished by training the CRNN with species concentration data via stochastic gradient descent. We demonstrate the successful implementations and the robustness of the approach in elucidating the chemical reaction pathways of several chemical engineering and biochemical systems. The autonomous inference by the CRNN approach precludes the need for expert knowledge in proposing candidate networks and addresses the curse of dimensionality in complex systems.

After introducing relevant terminology and the goals and range of possible knowledge of both attackers and defenders, we survey recent work on test-time evasion (TTE), data poisoning (DP), backdoor DP, and reverse engineering (RE) attacks and particularly defenses against the same. In so doing, we distinguish robust classification from anomaly detection (AD), unsupervised from supervised, and statistical hypothesis-based defenses from ones that do not have an explicit null (no attack) hypothesis. We also consider several scenarios for detecting backdoors. We provide a technical assessment for reviewed works, including identifying any issues/limitations, required hyperparameters, needed computational complexity, as well as the performance measures evaluated and the obtained quality. We then delve deeper, providing novel insights that challenge conventional AL wisdom and that target unresolved issues, including: robust classification versus AD as a defense strategy; the belief that attack success increases with attack strength, which ignores susceptibility to AD; small perturbations for TTE attacks: a fallacy or a requirement; validity of the universal assumption that a TTE attacker knows the ground-truth class for the example to be attacked; black, gray, or white-box attacks as the standard for defense evaluation; and susceptibility of query-based RE to an AD defense.

Since convolutional neural networks (CNN) are poor in extracting reliable features from original signal data, the time-frequency analysis method is usually called for to transform 1D signal into a 2D time-frequency coefficient matrix in which richer information could be exposed more easily. However, realistic fault diagnosis applications face a dilemma in that signal time-frequency analysis and fault classification cannot be implemented together, which means manual signal conversion work is also needed, which reduces the integrity and robustness of the fault diagnosis method. In this paper, a novel network named WPT-CNN is proposed for end-to-end intelligent fault diagnosis of rolling bearings. WPT-CNN creatively uses the standard deep neural network structure to realize the wavelet packet transform (WPT) time-frequency analysis function, which seamlessly integrates fault diagnosis domain knowledge into deep learning algorithms. The overall network architecture can be trained with gradient descent backpropagation algorithms, indicating that the time-frequency analysis module of WPT-CNN is also able to learn the dataset characteristics, adaptively representing signal information in the most suitable way. Two experimental rolling bearing fault datasets were used to validate the proposed method. Testing results showed that WPT-CNN obtained the testing accuracies of 99.73% and 99.89%, respectively, in two datasets, which exhibited a better and more reliable diagnosis performance than any other existing deep learning and machine learning methods.","",""

However, these proposed analog accelerators suffer from the intrinsic noise generated by their physical components, which makes it challenging to achieve high accuracy on deep neural networks. Hence, for successful deployment on analog accelerators, it is essential to be able to train deep neural networks to be robust to random continuous noise in the network weights, which is a somewhat new challenge in machine learning.

To combat this, we propose using knowledge distillation combined with noise injection during training to achieve more noise robust networks, which is demonstrated experimentally across different networks and datasets, including ImageNet.

Recently, more accurate and robust medical knowledge-guided methods have been proposed and have achieved superior performance. These methods inject the knowledge from a graph structure medical ontology into deep models via attention mechanisms to provide supplementary information of the input data.

These graphs not only carry the historical information from the EHR but also infuse with domain knowledge.

In fact, the spatial distribution between objects from different classes has a strong correlation characteristic. For example, buildings tend to be close to roads. In view of the strong appearance extraction ability of DSSN and the powerful topological relationship modeling capability of the graph convolutional neural network (GCN), a DSSN-GCN framework, which combines the advantages of DSSN and GCN, is proposed in this paper for RS image semantic segmentation. To lift the appearance extraction ability, this paper proposes a new DSSN called the attention residual U-shaped network (AttResUNet), which leverages residual blocks to encode feature maps and the attention module to refine the features. As far as GCN, the graph is built, where graph nodes are denoted by the superpixels and the graph weight is calculated by considering the spectral information and spatial information of the nodes. The AttResUNet is trained to extract the high-level features to initialize the graph nodes. Then the GCN combines features and spatial relationships between nodes to conduct classification. It is worth noting that the usage of spatial relationship knowledge boosts the performance and robustness of the classification module. In addition, benefiting from modeling GCN on the superpixel level, the boundaries of objects are restored to a certain extent and there are less pixel-level noises in the final classification result. Extensive experiments on two publicly open datasets show that DSSN-GCN model outperforms the competitive baseline (i.e., the DSSN model) and the DSSN-GCN when adopting AttResUNet achieves the best performance, which demonstrates the advance of our method.","",""

In this direction, two major challenges are to model triple semantics and to build a robust KB translator. We address these challenges by presenting a neural network approach, which learns continuous triple representation with a gated neural network. Accordingly, source triples and target triples are mapped in the same semantic vector space. We build a new dataset for English-Chinese KB translation from Freebase, and compare with several baselines on it. Experimental results show that the proposed method improves translation accuracy compared with baseline methods.

The buildings HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) systems, whose functionality is to maintain thermal comfort and indoor air quality (IAQ), account for almost half of the energy consumed by the buildings. Thus, intelligent scheduling of the building HVAC system has the potential for tremendous energy and cost savings while ensuring that the control objectives (thermal comfort, air quality) are satisfied. Traditionally, rule-based and model-based approaches such as linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) have been used for scheduling HVAC. However, the system complexity of HVAC and the dynamism in the building environment limit the accuracy, efficiency and robustness of such methods. Recently, several works have focused on model-free deep reinforcement learning based techniques such as Deep Q-Network (DQN). Such methods require extensive interactions with the environment. Thus, they are impractical to implement in real systems due to low sample efficiency. Safety-aware exploration is another challenge in real systems since certain actions at particular states may result in catastrophic outcomes. To address these issues and challenges, we propose a modelbased reinforcement learning approach that learns the system dynamics using a neural network. Then, we adopt Model Predictive Control (MPC) using the learned system dynamics to perform control with random-sampling shooting method. To ensure safe exploration, we limit the actions within safe range and the maximum absolute change of actions according to prior knowledge. We evaluate our ideas through simulation using widely adopted EnergyPlus tool on a case study consisting of a two zone data-center. Experiments show that the average deviation of the trajectories sampled from the learned dynamics and the ground truth is below 20%. Compared with baseline approaches, we reduce the total energy consumption by 17.1% ~ 21.8%.

One of the open issues in hand-vein verification is the lack of robustness against image quality degradation, which may comprise the verification accuracy. To achieve robust verification, vein feature extraction approaches, especially vein texture segmentation, have been extensively investigated. In recent years, deep neural networks have achieved promising results in medical image segmentation and have been brought into vein verification, but current solutions suffer from two challenges for vein segmentation: 1) lacking the labeling data, which is expensive to obtain and 2) the incorrect label data obtained by manual labeling scheme or automatic labeling scheme may strongly influence parameters when the network is trained, which may degrade the verification performance. This paper proposes an iterative deep belief network (DBN) to extract vein features based on the initial label data, which are automatically generated using a very limited a priori knowledge and iteratively corrected by our DBN. First, a known handcrafted vein image segmentation technique is employed to automatically label vein pixel and background pixel. A training dataset is constructed based on the patches centered on the labeled pixels. Second, a DBN is trained on the resulting database to predict the probability of each pixel to belong to be a vein pixel given a patch centered on it. The vein patterns are segmented using a probability threshold of 0.5. The resulting vein features are employed to reconstruct the training dataset, based on which the network is retrained. During the iterative procedure, the incorrect labels of training data are statistically corrected, which enables DBN to effectively learn what a finger-vein pattern is by learning the difference between vein patterns and background ones. The experimental results on two public hand-vein databases show a significant improvement in terms of hand-vein verification accuracy.","",""

Given a document of any domains, the model needs to figure out the sentiments with respect to fine-grained aspects in the documents. Two main challenges exist in this problem. One is to build a robust document modeling across domains; the other is to mine the domain-specific aspects and make use of the sentiment lexicon. In this paper, we propose a novel approach Neural Attentive model for cross-domain Aspect-level sentiment CLassification (NAACL), which leverages the benefits of the supervised deep neural network as well as the unsupervised probabilistic generative model to strengthen the representation learning. NAACL jointly learns two tasks: (i) a domain classifier, working on documents in both the source and target domains to recognize the domain information of input texts and transfer knowledge from the source domain to the target domain. In particular, a weakly supervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation model (wsLDA) is proposed to learn the domain-specific aspect and sentiment lexicon representations that are then used to calculate the aspect/lexicon-aware document representations via a multi-view attention mechanism; (ii) an aspect-level sentiment classifier, sharing the document modeling with the domain classifier. It makes use of the domain classification results and the aspect/sentiment-aware document representations to classify the aspect-level sentiment of the document in domain adaptation scenario. NAACL is evaluated on both English and Chinese datasets with the out-of-domain as well as in-domain setups. Quantitatively, the experiments demonstrate that NAACL has robust superiority over the compared methods in terms of classification accuracy and F1 score. The qualitative evaluation also shows that the proposed model is capable of reasonably paying attention to those words that are important to judge the sentiment polarity of the input text given an aspect.","",""

The estimation of defect size in specimen from the MFL measurements is a key and difficult problem. The traditional methods have low precision because feature extraction procedure relies on prior knowledge and the ability of designer. Inspired by the idea of convolutional neural network (CNN), a novel visual transformation CNN (VT-CNN) is proposed in this paper to overcome the limitation of traditional method in a feature extraction procedure. By adding a visual transformation layer according to the characteristics of the MFL measurements, the VT-CNN can distinguish the defect feature with different sizes more accurately. Moreover, since the VT-CNN method is designed based on the deep learning theory, more industrial big data with accurate label should be used to train the network. Due to the difficulty of making real industrial big data, a novel mesher magnetic dipole model is designed to simulate this industrial process. A large simulated MFL measurement of irregular defects produced by this model can increase the number of training samples and improve the robustness of the network. Experiments to estimate natural corrosion defects on real industrial pipelines are performed to validate the proposed framework. The experimental results are illustrated in detail, which highlights the superiority of the proposed method in industrial applications.","",""

The proposed CLEVER score is attack-agnostic and computationally feasible for large neural networks. Experimental results on various networks, including ResNet, Inception-v3 and MobileNet, show that (i) CLEVER is aligned with the robustness indication measured by the $\ell_2$ and $\ell_\infty$ norms of adversarial examples from powerful attacks, and (ii) defended networks using defensive distillation or bounded ReLU indeed achieve better CLEVER scores.

Different faults occur with varied frequencies by continuous arrival in chemical plants, while this issue has been hardly addressed in developing a diagnosis model. A novel incremental imbalance modified deep neural network (incremental-IMDNN) is proposed to promote the fault diagnosis to the imbalanced data stream. The first step in designing the incremental-IMDNN is the employment of an imbalance modified method combined with active learning for the extraction and generation of the most valuable information keeping in view the model feedback. DNN is utilized as a basic diagnosis model to excavate potential information. Then for the continuous arrival of new fault modes, DNN is promoted in an incremental hierarchical way. Unlike the traditional model that trained on a static snapshot of data, this model inherits the existing knowledge and hierarchically expands the diagnosis model by the similarity of faults. Similar faults that are judged by fuzzy clustering merge into a superclass, and every submodel shares the same architecture that is prevalent in previous research, which can be trained in parallel.
