It can provide rapid, non-contact, and robust non-invasive detection of both surface and subsurface damage. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an emerging subject that shows increasing potential in almost all fields and has recently attracted significant interest in TNDT. Thermal signals from TNDT have relatively low signal-noise-ratio (SNR), and most thermal images have the common weakness of edge blurring. The abovementioned obstacles lead to high requirements of field expertise and subjectivity in TNDT inspections. One of the purposes of developing AI is substituting human work more efficiently and objectively. The abovementioned weaknesses in TNDT may seek a way out of AI technologies. This paper offers a review of state-of-art researches on AI deployment in TNDT, discussing the current challenges and a roadmap for application expansion. Deep Learning is the most commonly used AI technology since it has powerful feature extraction and pattern recognition capabilities for imaging processing and computer vision. Most existing research adopted Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models utilizing only spatial information in thermal images to detect defects such as U-net, VGG, Yolo, etc. Except for defect detection, automated defect depth estimation is another focus in the deep learning method. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) such as LSTM and GRUs are usually applied for extracting the temporal feature from thermal sequences, which is sensitive to defect depth. Furtherly, different deep model variations and integrated algorithms are also reviewed, which improves the performance of defect detectability. Another exciting aspect of learning models using 3-dimensional thermograms is their ability to consider the spatial and temporal features to reveal more hidden defects. Some other points, such as the training dataset, which plays a crucial role in making a robust deep model, are discussed at the end of this paper.","",""

They have even outperformed human accuracy on some tasks. However, performance evaluation of such AI systems have been limited to accuracy measures on curated and clean benchmark datasets that may not properly reflect how robustly these systems can operate in real-world situations. In order to address this challenge, we introduce and implement a wide variety of perturbation methods that simulate different types of noise and variability in clinical text data. While noisy samples produced by these perturbation methods can often be understood by humans, they may cause AI systems to make erroneous decisions. Conducting extensive experiments on several clinical text processing tasks, we evaluated the robustness of high-performance NLP models against various types of character-level and word-level noise. The results revealed that the NLP models performance degrades when the input contains small amounts of noise. This study is a significant step towards exposing vulnerabilities of AI models utilized in clinical text processing systems. The proposed perturbation methods can be used in performance evaluation tests to assess how robustly clinical NLP models can operate on noisy data, in real-world settings.","",""

In order to diminish the PQ issue happen in the power system we need to perceive which of kind of disturbances are produced when the system had problem. This paper proposes a novel methodology for the Power Quality (PQ) disturbances classification in view of the wavelet transform and artificial neural networks.The proposed method consists of three important stages they are PQ disturbance generation, feature extraction and classification. In the first stage, the different power quality disturbances are generated by utilizing the algebraic equations based on numerical modelling. In the second stage, the 8-level discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is applied on the generated PQ disturbance signals. Then from each level eight types of features are extracted they are mean, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, energy, Shannon entropy, log energy entropy and Renyi’s entropy. These extracted features are given to the artificial neural network for training and based on these features PQ disturbances are classified and identified.

Such disturbances are often modeled as process noise, and common assumptions are that the underlying distributions are known and/or Gaussian. In practice, however, these assumptions may be unrealistic and can lead to poor approximations of the true noise distribution. We present a novel planning method that does not rely on any explicit representation of the noise distributions. In particular, we address the problem of computing a controller that provides probabilistic guarantees on safely reaching a target. First, we abstract the continuous system into a discrete-state model that captures noise by probabilistic transitions between states. As a key contribution, we adapt tools from the scenario approach to compute probably approximately correct (PAC) bounds on these transition probabilities, based on a finite number of samples of the noise. We capture these bounds in the transition probability intervals of a so-called interval Markov decision process (iMDP). This iMDP is robust against uncertainty in the transition probabilities, and the tightness of the probability intervals can be controlled through the number of samples. We use state-of-the-art verification techniques to provide guarantees on the iMDP, and compute a controller for which these guarantees carry over to the autonomous system. Realistic benchmarks show the practical applicability of our method, even when the iMDP has millions of states or transitions.","",""

This puts into question the security of DNNs in communication tasks, and in particular in modulation recognition.

When analyzing these vulnerable models we found that adversarial perturbations do not shift the symbols towards the nearest classes in constellation space. This shows that DNNs do not base their decisions on signal statistics that are important for the Bayes-optimal modulation recognition model, but spurious correlations in the training data.

ELM model showed a very good model fit at 30 neural nodes with a coefficient of determination (R) value of 99.2% which is far better than that of ANN and regression models which has R values of 96.5% and 92.4% respectively.

To amplify the strength and diversity of the base classifiers, a new backflow learning approach is proposed so that the base classifiers will relearn the misclassified data point. A final predictive result is obtained by fusing the prediction of all base classifiers through two-layer ensemble modeling. In addition, considering that noise data are a major problem that aggravates the accuracy of a predictive model, a new noise adaption approach based on the isolation forest algorithm is proposed to address noise data. It first calculates the outlier score of each data point to detect the noise data that are subsequently boosted in the training set to form the noise-adapted training set.

In a GPS/Inertial Navigation System (INS) tightly integration system, the GPS receiver’s carrier phase lock loops (PLLs) are aided by the Doppler shift from the INS, which can reduce user most dynamics. So the noise bandwidth can be narrowed to decrease the thermal noise tracking errors. However, due to the inertial sensor errors, the external INS-derived Doppler shift information are not completely accurate, therefore a Doppler-aiding error-induced phase error source must exist. The part of tracking error is derived in this paper. Other error sources are still present, so the bandwidth of PLLs cannot be set arbitrarily. This paper applies one artificial intelligence technique, the fuzzy logic controller (FLC), to calculate the PLL noise bandwidth on-line.

To address this issue, we use a new collection of initial‐condition large ensembles from the Community Earth System Model version 1 that are prescribed with different combinations of industrial aerosol and greenhouse gas forcing. To compare the climate response to these external forcings, we adopt an artificial neural network (ANN) architecture from previous work that predicts the year by training on maps of near‐surface temperature. We then utilize layer‐wise relevance propagation (LRP) to visualize the regional temperature signals that are important for the ANN's prediction in each climate model experiment. To mask noise when extracting only the most robust climate patterns from LRP, we introduce a simple uncertainty metric that can be adopted to other explainable artificial intelligence (AI) problems. We find that the North Atlantic, Southern Ocean, and Southeast Asia are key regions of importance for the neural network to make its prediction, especially prior to the early‐21st century. Notably, we also find that the ANN predictions based on maps of observations correlate higher to the actual year after training on the large ensemble experiment with industrial aerosols held fixed to 1920 levels. This work illustrates the sensitivity of regional temperature signals to changes in aerosol forcing in historical simulations.

Literature has proved that employing an artificial intelligence (AI) model for routing overcomes the lack of network knowledge and lack of human intervention and helps to learn robust patterns. Reinforced learning (RL) is a dynamically learning process that selects the actions based on continuous feedback received from the dynamic environment to maximize the reward.

Strain is an index of change in length between baseline length and length after deformation. It is important to recognise that GLS is a direct measurement of myocardial changes and different from left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), which is based on volume calculation. GLS is calculated by averaging multiple segments and overcomes the effects of partial noise and provides a robust marker of systolic function. Although the accuracy of GLS measurements depends on the experience of the observer, its variability is smaller and more reproducible than that of LVEF, even in the hands of inexperienced observers. Recently, artificial intelligence was reported to improve precision in strain measurements. Small measurement variability means that even a small difference is not a measurement error. According to these backgrounds, GLS can be used to monitor the LV function during followup. Initially, GLS was used as a surrogate for LVEF, but in recent years, GLS has become a clinically useful method for detecting early signs of left ventricular dysfunction. In their Heart article, Olsen evaluated the prognostic utility of GLS in a cohort of 709 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Patients with relatively preserved ejection fraction (50%±12%) without moderate–severe mitral or aortic valve dysfunction were observed during a median followup of 3.8 years. Interestingly, in patients with preserved LVEF (cutoff values: 50%, n=415), the majority showed signs of abnormal myocardial deformation by GLS (cutoff value: −18%, n=340, 82%). Patients with GLS below the median (>−13.6%) had a twofold increased risk of allcause mortality. The authors concluded that GLS was an independent predictor of longterm outcomes after CABG, especially in patients with preserved LVEF. GLS is recommended in the management of valvular heart diseases in recent guidelines. The use of GLS continues to expand for a wide range of uses, including screening in the general population, acute heart failure, mitral regurgitation and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Table 1 summarised these previous reports for GLS. When we checked this table, we noticed there was no specific cutoff value. While the cutoff value of LVEF is set at actual values between 40% and 50% in the guidelines, the cutoff value of GLS varies, depending on the cardiovascular disease. Cutoff value is relatively lower for diseases that cause myocardial damage, such as myocardial infarction and cardiomyopathy, and relatively higher for diseases that do not cause direct myocardial damage, such as valvular disease. We should always pay attention to which disease GLS is used for. From physiological viewpoints, GLS can detect longitudinal myocardial deformation present in subendocardial layers. The impaired myocardial contractility in ischaemic heart disease affects the subendocardial layers (longitudinal myocardial fibres). On the other hand, LVEF mainly reflects the function of the midmyocardial layer (radial myocardial fibres). GLS not only makes it possible to assess myocardial function but also detects changes in the interstitial myocardium, including the extent of myocardial fibrosis. This may explain the additional value of GLS over LVEF for predicting cardiovascular outcomes in patients with CABG. On the other hand, it is important to note that GLS is only a measure of systolic function and is only a partial measure of the entire ischaemic cascade (figure 1). After CABG, significant improvement in contractile function is expected. However, Olsen was unable to provide additional information regarding changes of GLS after CABG with their clinical impact. Change of GLS after CABG might be a more important factor to determine the longterm clinical outcomes after CABG.","",""

Based on performance, the Microsoft API was integrated with Google’s trained word2vec model to enhance the keywords with more complete semantic information. The extracted word vector was integrated with the proposed lip-reading architecture for audio-visual speech recognition. Three forms of convolutional neural networks (3D CNN, 3D dense connection CNN, and multilayer 3D CNN) were used in the proposed lip-reading architecture. Vectors extracted from API and vision were classified after concatenation. The proposed architecture enhanced the OCSR API average accuracy rate by 14.42% using standard ASR evaluation measures along with the signal-to-noise ratio. The proposed model exhibits improved performance in various noise settings, increasing the dependability of OCSR APIs for practical applications.","",""

However, recent studies demonstrated that DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial manipulations at testing time. Specifically, suppose we have a testing example, whose label can be correctly predicted by a DNN classifier. An attacker can add a small carefully crafted noise to the testing example such that the DNN classifier predicts an incorrect label, where the crafted testing example is called adversarial example. Such attacks are called evasion attacks. Evasion attacks are one of the biggest challenges for deploying DNNs in safety and security critical applications such as self-driving cars. In this work, we develop new DNNs that are robust to state-of-the-art evasion attacks. Our key observation is that adversarial examples are close to the classification boundary. Therefore, we propose region-based classification to be robust to adversarial examples. Specifically, for a benign/adversarial testing example, we ensemble information in a hypercube centered at the example to predict its label. In contrast, traditional classifiers are point-based classification, i.e., given a testing example, the classifier predicts its label based on the testing example alone. Our evaluation results on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrate that our region-based classification can significantly mitigate evasion attacks without sacrificing classification accuracy on benign examples. Specifically, our region-based classification achieves the same classification accuracy on testing benign examples as point-based classification, but our region-based classification is significantly more robust than point-based classification to state-of-the-art evasion attacks.","",""

Meanwhile, electrical energy demand prediction is one of the important concerns of energy systems so development of intelligent prediction methods and algorithms for performing accurate predictions is essential. Various techniques have been proposed for electrical energy demand prediction over different time intervals of short term, medium term and long term. This study presents an intelligent hybrid approach based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Noise filtering technique (which is one of Data Mining and Data Analysis concepts) for modeling and predicting long term electrical energy demand with high accuracy. At the first stage the hybrid approach applies noise filtering technique on raw data that consists of influential socio-economic factors affecting electricity demand, and as its consequence the raw data will be cleaned and smoothed. At the next stage it performs feature selection technique to determine the most influential factors and eliminate low impact factors. Subsequently selected filtered factors will be fed into PSO in order to build the prediction model (Filtered-PSO). For the purpose of investigating and validating influence of noise filtering on improvement of PSO, it compares results of the hybrid approach with Simple-PSO model which is built using raw data. It carries out the comparisons by means of paired t-test to check if the improvement is statistically significant or not. Results show that the Filtered-PSO model significantly outperforms Simple-PSO and we may consider noise filtering as an effective concept of data mining to be integrated with intelligent approaches such as PSO in order to improve accuracy of electrical energy demand predictions.","",""

Bad quality and erroneous data can result in inaccurate predictions even if the model is otherwise robust. Ensuring data quality is more critical in real-time applications where there is no human in the loop to perform sense checks on data or results. A real-time digital twin implementation for a floating system uses time-series data from numerous measurements such as wind, waves, GPS, vessel motions, mooring tensions, draft, etc. Statistics computed from the data are used in the digital twin. An extensive data checking and cleaning routine was written that performs data quality checks and corrections on the time series data before statistics are computed.  Various types of errors that typically occur in a time series include noise, flat-lined data, clipped data, outliers, and discontinuities. Statistical procedures were developed to check the raw time-series for all these errors. The procedures are generic and robust so they can be used for different types of data. Some data types are slow varying (e.g., GPS) while the others are fast varying random processes. A measurement classified as an error in one type of data is not necessarily an error in the other data type. For example, GPS data can be discontinuous by nature but a discontinuity in the wave data indicates an error. Likewise, checking for white noise in mooring tension data is not that meaningful. We developed parametric data procedures so that the same routine can handle different types of data and their errors. Outlier removal routines use the standard deviation of the time-series which itself could be biased from errors. Therefore, a method to compute unbiased statistics from the raw data is developed and implemented for robust outlier removal.  Extensive testing on years of measured data and on hundreds of data channels was performed to ensure that data cleaning procedures function as intended. Statistics (mean, standard deviations, maximum, and minimum) were computed from both the raw and cleaned data. Comparison showed significant differences in raw and cleaned statistics, with the latter obviously being more accurate.  Data cleaning, while not sounding as high tech as other analytics algorithms, is a critical foundation of any data science application. Using cleaned time-series data and corresponding statistics ensure that a data analytics model provides actionable results. Clean data and statistics help achieve the intended purpose of the digital twin, which is to inform operators of the health/condition of the asset and flag any anomalous events.","",""

Previous studies of dimensionality reduction have three common problems: 1) The conventional techniques are disturbed by noise data. In the context of determining useful features, the noises may have adverse effects on the result. Given that noises are inevitable, it is essential for dimensionality reduction techniques to be robust from noises. 2) The conventional techniques separate the graph learning system apart from informative feature determination. These techniques used to construct a data structure graph first, and keep the graph unchanged to process the feature extraction or feature selection. Hence, the result of feature extraction or feature selection is strongly relying on the graph constructed. 3) The conventional techniques determine data intrinsic structure with less systematic and partial analyzation. They maintain either the data global structure or the data local manifold structure. As a result, it becomes difficult for one technique to achieve great performance in different datasets.  We propose three learning models that overcome prementioned problems for various tasks  under different learning environment. Specifically, our research outcomes are listing as  followings:  1) We propose a novel learning model that joints Sparse Representation (SR) and  Locality Preserving Projection (LPP), named Joint Sparse Representation and  Locality Preserving Projection for Feature Extraction (JSRLPP), to extract  informative features in the context of unsupervised learning environment. JSRLPP  processes the feature extraction and data structure learning simultaneously, and is  able to capture both the data global and local structure. The sparse matrix in the  model operates directly to deal with different types of noises. We conduct  comprehensive experiments and confirm that the proposed learning model  performs impressive over the state-of-the-art approaches.  2) We propose a novel learning model that joints SR and Data Residual Relationships  (DRR), named Unsupervised Feature Selection with Adaptive Residual Preserving  (UFSARP), to select informative features in the context of unsupervised learning  environment. Such model does not only reduce disturbance of different types of  noise, but also effectively enforces similar samples to have similar reconstruction  residuals. Besides, the model carries graph construction and feature determination  simultaneously. Experimental results show that the proposed framework improves  the effect of feature selection.  3) We propose a novel learning model that joints SR and Low-rank Representation  (LRR), named Sparse Representation based Classifier with Low-rank Constraint  (SRCLC), to extract informative features in the context of supervised learning environment. When processing the model, the Low-rank Constraint (LRC) regularizes both the within-class structure and between-class structure while the sparse matrix works to handle noises and irrelevant features. With extensive experiments, we confirm that SRLRC achieves impressive improvement over other approaches.  To sum up, with the purpose of obtaining appropriate feature subset, we propose three novel learning models in the context of supervised learning and unsupervised learning to complete the tasks of feature extraction and feature selection respectively.

One of the main advantages of using FFNs is that they usually do not require, in the learning process, exact mathematical knowledge about input-output dependencies. In other words, they may be regarded as model-free approximators (Hornik, 1989). They learn by minimizing some kind of an error function to fit training data as close as possible. Such learning scheme doesn’t take into account a quality of the training data, so its performance depends strongly on the fact whether the assumption, that the data are reliable and trustable, is hold. This is why when the data are corrupted by the large noise, or when outliers and gross errors appear, the network builds a model that can be very inaccurate. In most real-world cases the assumption that errors are normal and iid, simply doesn’t hold. The data obtained from the environment are very often affected by noise of unknown form or outliers, suspected to be gross errors. The quantity of outliers in routine data ranges from 1 to 10% (Hampel, 1986). They usually appear in data sets during obtaining the information and pre-processing them when, for instance, measurement errors, long-tailed noise, or results of human mistakes may occur. Intuitively we can define an outlier as an observation that significantly deviates from the bulk of data. Nevertheless, this definition doesn’t help in classifying an outlier as a gross error or a meaningful and important observation. To deal with the problem of outliers a separate branch of statistics, called robust statistics (Hampel, 1986, Huber, 1981), was developed. Robust statistical methods are designed to act well when the true underlying model deviates from the assumed parametric model. Ideally, they should be efficient and reliable for the observations that are very close to the assumed model and simultaneously for the observations containing larger deviations and outliers. The other way is to detect and remove outliers before the beginning of the model building process. Such methods are more universal but they do not take into account the specific type of modeling philosophy (e.g. modeling by the FFNs). In this article we propose new robust FFNs learning algorithm based on the least trimmed squares estimator.","",""

All rights reserved. and grammar. Planning advances that increase robot autonomy do not correlate to free-er form language or higher level abstractions as should be the case when acquiring language. Progress on language has largely focused on grounding visual attributes (Kollar, Krishnamurthy, and Strimel 2013; Matuszek et al. 2014) and on learning spatial relations and actions for small vocabularies with hard-coded abstract concepts (Steels and Vogt 1997; Roy 2002; Guadarrama et al. 2013). Language is sometimes grounded into simple actions (Yu and Siskind 2013) but the data, while multimodal, is formulaic, the vocabularies are small, and the grammar is constrained. Recently the connection between less formulaic language and simple actions has been explored successfully in the context of simulated worlds (Branavan et al. 2009; Goldwasser and Roth 2011; Branavan, Silver, and Barzilay 2011; Artzi and Zettlemoyer 2013) and videos (Malmaud et al. 2015; Venugopalan et al. 2015). To our knowledge, there is no body of work on understanding the relation between natural language and complex actions and goals or from sequences of actions to natural language. As observed by Klingspor (1997), there is a big gap between the formulaic interactions that are typical of stateof-the-art human-robot communications and human-human interactions, which are more abstract. Proposed Problem-Solution Sequences Data An intuitive characterization We have built a large corpus of Problem-Solution Sequences (PSS) (see Figure 1 for an example). A PSS consists of a sequence of images/frames that encode what a robot sees as it goes about accomplishing a goal. To instantiate our framework, we focus first on PSSs specific to a simple world that has blocks stacked on a table and a robot that can visually inspect the table and manipulate the blocks on it. In Figure 1, each image in the PSS corresponds to an intermediate block configuration that the robot goes through as it modifies the initial state block configuration into the final one. The PSS makes explicit the natural language instructions that a human may give to a robot in order to transform the configuration in an Imagei into the configuration in an Imagej the two configurations may correspond to one robot action (for adjacent states in the sequence) or to a sequence of robot actions (for non-adjacent states).

Improvements in databases technology, computing performance and artificial intelligence have contributed to the development of intelligent data analysis. The primary aim of data mining is to discover patterns in the data that lead to better understanding of the data generating process and to useful predictions. Examples of applications of data mining include detecting fraudulent credit card transactions, character recognition in automated zip code reading, and predicting compound activity in drug discovery. Real-world data sets are often characterized by having large numbers of examples, e.g. billions of credit card transactions and potential ‘drug-like’ compounds; being highly unbalanced, e.g. most transactions are not fraudulent, most compounds are not active against a given biological target; and, being corrupted by noise. The relationship between predictive variables, e.g. physical descriptors, and the target concept, e.g. compound activity, is often highly non-linear. One recent technique that has been developed to address these issues is the support vector machine. The support vector machine has been developed as robust tool for classification and regression in noisy, complex domains. The two key features of support vector machines are generalization theory, which leads to a principled way to choose an hypothesis; and, kernel functions, which introduce non-linearity in the hypothesis space without explicitly requiring a non-linear algorithm.

Knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) and data mining (DM) are areas of common interest to researchers in machine learning, pattern recognition, statistics, artificial intelligence, and high performance computing. An effective and robust method, the regression class mixture decomposition (RCMD) method, is proposed for the mining of regression classes in large data sets, especially those contaminated by noise. A concept, called ""regression class"" which is defined as a subset of the data set that is subject to a regression model, is proposed as a basic building block on which the mining process is based. A large data set is treated as a mixture population in which there are many such regression classes and others not accounted for by the regression models. Iterative and genetic-based algorithms for the optimization of the objective function in the RCMD method are also constructed. It is demonstrated that the RCMD method can resist a very large proportion of noisy data, identify each regression class, assign an inlier set of data points supporting each identified regression class, and determine the a priori unknown number of statistically valid models in the data set. Although the models are extracted sequentially, the final result is almost independent of the extraction order due to a dynamic classification strategy employed in the handling of overlapping regression classes. The effectiveness and robustness of the RCMD method are substantiated by a set of simulation experiments and a real-life application showing the way it can be used to fit mixed data to linear regression classes and nonlinear structures in various situations.","",""

Improvements in databases technology, computing performance and artificial intelligence have contributed to the development of intelligent data analysis. The primary aim of data mining is to discover patterns in the data that lead to better understanding of the data generating process and to useful predictions. Examples of applications of data mining include detecting fraudulent credit card transactions, character recognition in automated zip code reading, and predicting compound activity in drug discovery. Real-world data sets are often characterized by having large numbers of examples, e.g. billions of credit card transactions and potential ‘drug-like’ compounds; being highly unbalanced, e.g. most transactions are not fraudulent, most compounds are not active against a given biological target; and, being corrupted by noise. The relationship between predictive variables, e.g. physical descriptors, and the target concept, e.g. compound activity, is often highly non-linear. One recent technique that has been developed to address these issues is the support vector machine. The support vector machine has been developed as robust tool for classification and regression in noisy, complex domains. The two key features of support vector machines are generalization theory, which leads to a principled way to choose an hypothesis; and, kernel functions, which introduce non-linearity in the hypothesis space without explicitly requiring a non-linear algorithm. In this paper we introduce support vector machines cascade svm and randomized sampling technique highlight the advantages thereof over existing data analysis techniques, also are noted some important points for the data mining practitioner who wishes to use support vector machines.","",""

There are some problems to be solved in this domain, such as mechanical construction, electronics and control of mobile robots. But the main challenge is found in the areas related to Artificial Intelligence, as multi-agent systems, machine learning and computer vision. The problems and challenges mentioned above are not trivial, since Robot Soccer is dynamic, uncertain and probabilistic. A computer vision system for a Robot Soccer team must be fast and robust, and it is desirable that it can handle noise and luminous intensity variations. A number of techniques can be applied for object recognition in the domain of Robot Soccer, as described by (Grittani et al., 2000). The research of (Grittani et al., 2000) is based only on color information, as well as the research of (Weiss & Hildebrand, 2004) that uses color information to reduce the amount of information contained in each image frame through a called “relevance point filter”. Other researches uses the shape model of the objects to detect on the image, technique generally used in local vision systems. The research of (Gonner et al., 2005), for instance, detects the ball through it’s shape model projected on the image, a circumference, but still uses color-only information to recognize the robots. No matter which technique is used to solve the Robot Soccer computer vision challenge, it must be able to determine position and angle of the robots and the ball with maximum accuracy and minimal processing time possible, because the success of the strategy and control system depends on the information given by the computer vision system. This chapter extends the work presented by (Martins et al., 2006a), which considers the use of a well known image segmentation technique – the Hough Transform – to locate the mobile robots and the ball on global vision images, taking advantage of the domain characteristics – the robots and ball shape. To implement the Hough Transform technique, which is in most cases implemented in robotic systems using special hardware, only an offthe-shelf frame grabber and a personal computer are used. A new approach to interpret the Hough space is proposed, as well as the method used to recognize objects, which is based on a constraint satisfaction approach.","",""

The spectrum and the statistics of the signal and of the corrupting noise are assumed unknown except that the signal is assumed to have a rational spectrum. An algorithm based on both system and signal theory, and on heuristics is derived to select a set of frequencies where the SNR is high from a given measurement spectrum. A relative weighting which indicates the importance of the measurement at each frequency is also obtained. An estimate of the signal model is obtained from the best weighted least squares fit to the measurement spectrum at the selected frequencies. The proposed scheme has applications to control and signal processing, and is evaluated with a number of simulated examples, and on a physical system. The results are compared with conventional adaptive filter techniques.","",""

Several cases with different operating points and noise variances are studied. The evolutionary programming is robust to search for the real values of parameters in all of these cases. The estimation using evolutionary programming is compared with that using a corrected extended Kalman filter. The comparison shows that when the data are highly contaminated by noise, evolutionary programming still gives satisfactory results; while estimation using the extended Kalman filter tends to diverge with such data.","",""

In order to achieve stable quantitative measurement of projected bone mineral density, a calibration using sample bone in regions containing only soft tissue must be performed. In addition, the projected area of bone must be measured. We show that, using an image with a realistically low noise, the histogram of pixel values exhibits a well-defined peak corresponding to the soft tissue region. A threshold at a fixed multiple of the calibration segment value readily separates bone from soft tissue in a wide variety of patient studies. Our technique, which is employed in the Hologic QDR-1000 Bone Densitometer, is rapid, robust, and significantly simpler than a conventional artificial intelligence approach using edge-detection to define objects and expert systems to recognize them.","",""

The network and its characteristics are reviewed, with particular focus on its performance in the presence of noisy input patterns. Simulation results indicate that, regarding geometry-size- and activation-constrained grey-scale patterns, the BEP classifier is sensitive to both additive low-amplitude spike noise and additive white Gaussian noise. Most of the misclassifications occur among patterns that differ only by small variations in force gradients. The network's performance gradually improves when noisy patterns are included in the training set, but indications are that large training sets or alternative error functions in BEP will be required to achieve robust performance in the tactile domain.<<ETX>>","",""

The accurate and more reliable prediction of TDG has a very significant role in preserving the diversity of aquatic organisms and reducing the phenomenon of fish deaths. Herein, two machine learning approaches called support vector regression (SVR) and extreme learning machine (ELM) have been applied to predict the saturated TDG% at USGS 14150000 and USGS 14181500 stations which are located in the USA. For the USGS 14150000 station, the recorded samples from 13 October 2016 to 14 March 2019 (75%) were used for training set, and the rest from 15 March 2019 to 13 October 2019 (25%) were used for testing requirements. Similarly, for USGS 14181500 station, the hourly data samples which covered the period from 9 June 2017 till 11 March 2019 were used for calibrating the models and from 12 March 2019 until 9 October 2019 were used for testing the predictive models. Eight input combinations based on different parameters have been established as well as nine statistical performance measures have been used for evaluating the accuracy of adopted models, for instance, not limited, correlation of determination (        R      2        ), mean absolute relative error (MAE), and uncertainty at 95% (        U      95        ). The obtained results of the study for both stations revealed that the ELM managed efficiently to estimate the TDG in comparison to SVR technique. For USGS 14181500 station, the statistical measures for ELM (SVR) were, respectively, reported as         R      2        of 0.986 (0.986), MAE of 0.316 (0.441), and         U      95        of 3.592 (3.869). Lastly, for USGS 14181500 station, the statistical measures for ELM (SVR) were, respectively, reported as         R      2        of 0.991 (0.991), MAE of 0.338 (0.396), and         U      95        of 0.832 (0.837). In addition, ELM’s training process computational time is stated to be much shorter than that of SVM. The results also showed that the temperature parameter was the most significant variable that influenced TDG relative to the other parameters. Overall, the proposed model (ELM) proved to be an appropriate and efficient computer-assisted technology for saturated TDG modeling that will contribute to the basic knowledge of environmental considerations.","",""

During wall climbing of hybrid UGVs, stability is essential and depends on real time feedback from multiple sensors. To increase stability and control, it is proposed that PID control loops should be replaced by AI based algorithms that reduce the decision time and mathematical complexity. For autonomous movement in any terrain using the proposed model, intelligent UGVs can map and localize simultaneously.They can make intelligent decisions about mode of movement i.e. driving on ground or wall, steering on ground or wall, flying and maneuvering by using real time sensor readings. Integration of the proposed AI models with HUGV can be applied to many areas which are hard for humans to access, for instance; inspection of large structures, bio & nuclear hazard environments, planetary exploration & magnetic fields detection.","",""

This article discusses recent progress in AI and then describes eight ideas related to robustness that are being pursued within the AI research community. While these ideas are a start, we need to devote more attention to the challenges of dealing with the known and unknown unknowns.
