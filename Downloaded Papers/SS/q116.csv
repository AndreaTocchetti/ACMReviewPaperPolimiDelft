Since a long time, there are models of symbolic regression in use that are perfectly explainable and mathematically tractable: in this contribution we demonstrate how to use symbolic regression methods to infer the optimal control of a dynamical system given one or several optimization criteria, or cost functions. In previous publications, network control was achieved by automatized machine learning control using genetic programming. Here, we focus on the subsequent analysis of the analytical expressions which result from the machine learning. In particular, we use AUTO to analyze the stability properties of the controlled oscillator system which served as our model. As a result, we show that there is a considerable advantage of explainable models over less accessible neural networks.","",""

However, the analog computations in crossbars introduce errors due to several non-idealities. Moreover, since communications between crossbars are usually done in the digital domain, the energy and area costs are dominated by the Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADC). Among the eNVM technologies, Resistive Random-Access-Memory (RRAM) and Phase-Change Memory (PCM) devices suffer from poor endurance, Write variability and conductance drift. Whereas magneto-resistive technologies provide superior endurance, write stability and reliability. To that effect, we propose sparsity-aware device/circuit co-design of robust crossbars using Spin-Orbit-Torque Magnetic Tunnel Junctions (SOT-MTJs). Note, standard MTJs have low $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{O}\mathrm{F}\mathrm{F}}/\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{O}\mathrm{N}}$ and low $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{O}\mathrm{N}}$, making them unsuitable for crossbars. In this work, we first demonstrate SOT-MTJs as crossbar elements With high $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{O}\mathrm{N}}$ and high $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{O}\mathrm{F}\mathrm{F}}/\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{O}\mathrm{N}}$ by allowing the read-path to have thicker tunneling-barrier, leaving the write path undisturbed. Second, through extensive simulations, we quantitatively assess the impact of various device-circuit parameters such as $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{O}\mathrm{N}}, \mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{O}\mathrm{F}\mathrm{F}}/\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{O}\mathrm{N}}$ ratio, crossbar size, along With input and weight sparsity, on both circuit and application level accuracy and energy consumption.

The presented control algorithm was based on the machine learning and sliding mode control (SMC) methods. The control compensator used neural networks to estimate the actuator’s dead zone and eliminate its effects. The robust SMC compensator acted as an auxiliary controller to guarantee the system’s stability and robustness under circumstances with model uncertainties, approximation errors, and friction forces. The stability of the closed-loop system and the asymptotic convergence of tracking errors were evaluated using Lyapunov theory. The simulation results showed that the dead zone’s non-linearity can be estimated correctly, and satisfactory trajectory tracking performance can be obtained in this way, since the influences of the actuator’s dead zone were eliminated. The convergence time of the system was reduced from 1.1 to 0.8 s, and the maximum steady-state error was reduced from 0.06 to 0.015 rad.

The MC data in this paper require only the examination of failure or non-failure, circumventing the time-consuming calculation of factors of safety. An extensive dataset is generated, consisting of 120,000 finite difference MC slope stability simulations incorporating different levels of soil heterogeneity and anisotropy. The Bagging Ensemble, Random Forest and Support Vector classifiers are found to be the superior models for this problem amongst 9 different models and ensemble classifiers. Trained only on 0.47% of data (500 samples), the ML model can classify the entire 120,000 samples with an accuracy of %85 and AUC score of %91. The performance of ML methods in classifying the random field slope stability results generally reduces with higher anisotropy and heterogeneity of soil.

Power electronic converters, regardless of their power or voltage, must contend with a rising challenge known as electromagnetic transient stability. For power system stability analysis and control, transient stability assessment (TSA) is essential. On the basis of numerical integration of the dynamics equations for an EPS under consideration at a particular disturbance, a method for assessing transient stability reserves is described. In order to improve the transient stability of hybrid AC/DC power systems, a multi-HVDC emergency coordinated modulating method has been suggested in this study. Multi-DC lines are used to build and test the AC/DC hybrid power system. Machine learning models that forecast power system transient stability are more reliable, versatile, and robust if they incorporate knowledge of power system dynamics into their data gathering process. Fault location and how disturbance effects spread over the network are critical for determining unstable regions of operation, thus this determination is made using domain knowledge. That’s why traditional machine learning models may now be used in an instance transfer learning framework thanks to a whole new data gathering technique. Therefore, the suggested solution does not rely primarily on the collected data, but also incorporates system insights.","",""

Unlike other oncogenic pathways such as RAS, defi ning tumors that are Hippo pathway–dependent is far more complex due to the lack of hotspot genetic alterations. Here, we developed a machine-learning framework to identify a robust, cancer type–agnostic gene expression signature to quantitate Hippo pathway activity and cross-talk as well as predict YAP/TEAD dependency across cancers. Further, through chemical genetic interaction screens and multiomics analyses, we discover a direct interaction between MAPK signaling and TEAD stability such that knockdown of YAP combined with MEK inhibition results in robust inhibition of tumor cell growth in Hippo dysregulated tumors. This multifaceted approach underscores how computational models combined with experimental studies can inform precision medicine approaches including predictive diagnostics and combination strategies.

However, with the large volume of data collected persistently with wide field of view sensors, manual inspection by humans may not be sustainable. It is desirable to automate the stability assessment to (a) classify the satellite as stable or tumbling and when possible (b) pinpoint the moment it transitions from stable to becoming unstable. In this paper, we will show how such an automated system is developed. We found the Random Forest (RF) of Decision Trees classifier to be sufficiently robust and accurate as a solution for (a) when the satellites are either stable or in an established (steady) state of tumbling, as evidenced by the high level of accuracy for stability assessment achieved by the RF. A discussion of the optimal features to use with RF is provided. Once the RF algorithm has detected the first night the satellite becomes unstable, we then aim to pinpoint the precise time of the change. Our trained RF alone is not sufficient for detecting the onset of tumbling because it requires and labels the entire light curve. Also with our existing data set, it was not sufficiently trained to recognize the state in the interim. During that time a combination of two tests is used to recognize a tumbling satellite. The periodicity test determines the significance of periodicity at the detected frequency. The normality test applied to residuals in the signature subintervals detects the presence of aliasing, which is caused by the fundamental tumbling frequency being higher than the observation sampling frequency. In the aftermath of the onset of instability, all three tests – RF, periodicity, and normality – are combined to update the satellite’s status. We show the results of applying this set of algorithms on multi-year high cadence photometry of geosynchronous satellites.","",""

Time series forecasting in the energy sector is important to power utilities for decision making to ensure the sustainability and quality of electricity supply, and the stability of the power grid.

Such scenarios could enable steady-state reactor operation with high fusion gain — the ratio of produced fusion power to the external power provided through the plasma boundary. Precise and robust control of the evolution of the plasma boundary shape as well as the spatial distribution of the plasma current, density, temperature, and rotation will be essential to achieving and maintaining such scenarios. The complexity of the evolution of tokamak plasmas, arising due to nonlinearities and coupling between various parameters, motivates the use of model-based control algorithms that can account for the system dynamics.

Here, in presence of unknown discrete variation (DV) of its parameters within a bounded range, a system controlled by a static feedback controller in which the closed-loop (CL) equilibria are subject to variation-induced drift is equivalently represented using a class of time-invariant systems, each with the same control policy.

For robust and accurate control of complex systems a precise model of the system dynamics is  essential. Building such highly precise dynamics models from physical knowledge often requires  substantial manual effort and poses a great challenge in industrial applications. Acquiring a model  automatically from system measurements employing regression techniques allows to decrease  manual effort and, thus, poses an interesting alternative to knowledge-based modeling. Based on  such a learned dynamics model, an approximately optimal controller can be inferred automatically.  Such approaches are the subject of model-based reinforcement learning (RL) and learn optimal  control from interactions with the system. Especially when probabilistic dynamics models such  as Gaussian processes are employed, model-based RL has been tremendously successful and has  attracted much attention from both the control and machine learning communities. However,  several problems need to be solved to facilitate widespread deployment of model-based RL for  learning control in real world scenarios. In this thesis, we address two current limitations of  model-based RL that are indispensable prerequisites for widespread deployment of model-based  RL in real world tasks.  In many real world applications a poor controller can cause severe damage to the system or  even put the safety of humans at risk. Thus, it is essential to ensure that the controlled system  behaves as desired. While this question has been studied extensively in classical control, stability  of closed-loop control systems with dynamics given as a Gaussian process has not been considered  yet. We propose an automatic tool to compute regions of the state space where the desired behavior  of the system can be guaranteed. We consider dynamics given as the mean of a GP as well as  the full GP posterior distribution. In the first case, the proposed tool constructs regions of the  state space, such that the trajectories starting in this region converge to the target state. From this  asymptotic result, we follow statements for finite time horizons and stability under the presence  of disturbances. In the second case the system dynamics is given as a GP posterior distribution.  Thus, computation of multi-step-ahead predictions requires averaging over all plausible dynamics  models given the observations. A a consequence, multi-step-ahead predictions become analytically  intractable. We propose an approximation based on numerical quadrature that can handle complex  state distributions, e.g., with multiple modes and provides upper bounds for the approximation  error. Exploiting these error bounds, we present an automatic tool to compute stability regions. In  these regions of the state space, our tool guarantees that for a finite time horizon the system behaves  as desired with a given probability. Furthermore, we analyze asymptotic behavior of closed-loop  control systems with dynamics given as a GP posterior distribution. In this case we show that for  some common choices of the prior, the system has a unique stationary distribution to which the  system state converges irrespective of the starting state.  Another major challenge of RL for real world control applications is to minimize interactions  with the system required for learning. While RL approaches based on GP dynamics models  have demonstrated great data efficiency, the average amount of required system interactions can further be reduced. To achieve this goal, we propose to employ the numerical quadrature based  approximation to propagate the value of a state. To show how this approximation can further  increase data efficiency, we employ it in the two main classes of model-based RL: policy search  and value iteration. In policy search, the state distribution must be computed to evaluate the  expected long-term reward for a policy. The proposed numerical quadrature based approximation  substantially improves estimates of the expected long-term reward and its gradients. As a result,  data efficiency is significantly increased.  For the value function based approaches for policy learning, the value propagation step is  completely characterized by the Bellman equation. However, this equation is intractable for  nonlinear dynamics. In this case, we propose a projection-based value iteration approach. We  employ numerical quadrature to facilitate projection of the value function onto a linear feature  space. Suitable features for value function representation are learned online without manual effort.  This feature learning is constructed such that upper bounds for the projection error can be obtained.  The proposed value iteration approach learns globally optimal policies and significantly benefits  from the introduced highly accurate approximations.","",""

However, in depth study of oxygen metabolism with MRI has so far been hindered by the lack of robust methods. One MRI method of mapping CMRO2 is based on the simultaneous acquisition of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) weighted images during respiratory modulation of both oxygen and carbon dioxide. Although this dual-calibrated methodology has shown promise in the research setting, current analysis methods are unstable in the presence of noise and/or are computationally demanding. In this paper, we present a machine learning implementation for the multi-parametric assessment of dual-calibrated fMRI data. The proposed method aims to address the issues of stability, accuracy, and computational overhead, removing significant barriers to the investigation of oxygen metabolism with MRI. The method utilizes a time-frequency transformation of the acquired perfusion and BOLD-weighted data, from which appropriate feature vectors are selected for training of machine learning regressors. The implemented machine learning methods are chosen for their robustness to noise and their ability to map complex non-linear relationships (such as those that exist between BOLD signal weighting and blood oxygenation). An extremely randomized trees (ET) regressor is used to estimate resting blood flow and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is used to estimate CMRO2 and the oxygen extraction fraction (OEF). Synthetic data with additive noise are used to train the regressors, with data simulated to cover a wide range of physiologically plausible parameters. The performance of the implemented analysis method is compared to published methods both in simulation and with in-vivo data (n=30). The proposed method is demonstrated to significantly reduce computation time, error, and proportional bias in both CMRO2 and OEF estimates. The introduction of the proposed analysis pipeline has the potential to not only increase the detectability of metabolic difference between groups of subjects, but may also allow for single subject examinations within a clinical context.","",""

Understanding the shear strength of the overburden and the reservoir is important in risk assessment of slope stability in open-pit mining and caprock integrity of in-situ thermal recovery of oil sands while optimizing the production of bitumen.  Due to the restrictions of computational efficiency, cells used for simulation cannot be smaller enough to capture the details of heterogeneity in the reservoir.

The trained model improves accuracy by 12%-76% compared to traditional methods such as response surface methodology (RSM). MLEU provides a reasonable estimate of anisotropic shear strength while considering uncertainties caused by different configurations of shale beddings. With the increasing demand for regional scale modeling of geotechnical problems, the proposed MLEU technique can be extended to other geological settings where weak beddings play a significant role and the impact of heterogeneity on shear strength is important.","",""

The recursive feasibility and stability of the closed-loop system are discussed under the convergence arguments of the approximation algorithms adopted. Also, the robustness property of r-LPC is analyzed theoretically by taking into consideration the existence of perturbations on the controller due to possible approximation errors. Simulation results with the proposed learning control approach for the data-driven regulation of a Van der Pol oscillator system have been reported, including the comparisons with a classic MPC and an infinite-horizon Dual Heuristic Programming (DHP) algorithm. The results show that the r-LPC significantly outperforms the DHP algorithm in terms of control performance and can be comparative to the MPC in terms of regulating control as well as energy consumption. Moreover, its average computational cost is much smaller than that with the MPC in the adopted environment.","",""

As impressive as the empirical success of these methods have been, strong theoretical guarantees of performance, safety, or robustness are few and far between. This manuscript takes a step towards such providing such guarantees by establishing finite-data performance guarantees for identifying and controlling fully- or partially-unknown dynamical systems.In this manuscript, we explore three different viewpoints that each provide different quantitative guarantees of performance. First, we present a generalization of the classical theory of integral quadratic constraints. This generalization leads to a tractable computational procedure for finding exponential stability certificates for partially-unknown feedback systems. Second, we present non-asymptotic lower and upper bounds for core problems in the field of system identification. Finally, using the recently developed system-level synthesis framework and tools from high-dimensional statistics, we establish finite-sample performance guarantees for robust output-feedback control of an unknown dynamical system.","",""

An important aspect of this is evaluating how robust a model is to changes in setting or population, which typically requires applying the model to multiple, independent datasets. Since the cost of collecting such datasets is often prohibitive, in this paper, we propose a framework for analyzing this type of stability using the available data. We use the original evaluation data to determine distributions under which the algorithm performs poorly, and estimate the algorithm’s performance on the “worst-case” distribution. We consider shifts in user defined conditional distributions, allowing some distributions to shift while keeping other portions of the data distribution fixed. For example, in a healthcare context, this allows us to consider shifts in clinical practice while keeping the patient population fixed. To address the challenges associated with estimation in complex, high-dimensional distributions, we derive a “debiased” estimator which maintains p N -consistency even when machine learning methods with slower convergence rates are used to estimate the nuisance parameters. In experiments on a real medical risk prediction task, we show this estimator can be used to analyze stability and accounts for realistic shifts that could not previously be expressed.

The main difficulty in improving the inflation cycle of a tire inflator is the identification of the tire connected for inflation. A robust single hidden layer feed forward neural network (SLFN) is, thus, used in this study to model and predict the correct tire size. The tire size is directly related to the tire inflation cycle. Once the tire size is identified, the inflation process can be optimized to improve performance, speed and accuracy of the inflation system. Properly inflated tire and tire condition is critical to vehicle safety, stability and controllability. The training times of traditional back propagation algorithms, mostly used to model such tire identification processes, are far slower than desired for implementation of an on-line control system. Use of slow gradient based learning methods and iterative tuning of all network parameters during the learning process are the two major causes for such slower learning speed. An extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm, which randomly selects the input weights and biases and analytically determines the output weights, is used in this work to train the SLFNs. It is found that networks trained with ELM have relatively good generalization performance, much shorter training times and stable performance with regard to the changes in number of hidden layer neurons. The result represents robustness of the trained networks and enhance reliability of the mode.

Multiple lines of evidence have demonstrated the persistence of global land carbon (C) sink during the past several decades. However, both annual net ecosystem productivity (NEP) and its inter-annual variation (IAVNEP) keep varying over space. Thus, identifying local indicators for the spatially varying NEP and IAVNEP is critical for locating the major and sustainable C sinks on the land. Here, based on a machine-learning-derived database, we first showed that the variations of NEP and IAVNEP are spatially asynchronous. Then, based on daily NEP observations from eddy covariance sites, we found robust logarithmic correlation between annual NEP and ratio of total CO2 exchanges during net uptake (U) and release (R) periods (i.e., U/R). The cross-site variation of mean annual NEP can be linearly indicated by ln(U/R), while the spatial distribution of IAVNEP was well indicated by the slope (i.e., β) of the demonstrated logarithmic correlation. Among biomes, for example, forests and croplands had the largest U/R ratio (1.06 ± 0.83) and β (473 ± 112 g C m−2 yr−1), indicating the highest NEP and IAVNEP in forests and croplands, respectively. We further showed that the spatial variations of NEP and IAVNEP were both underestimated by the machine-learning-based and process-based global models. Overall, this study underscores the asynchronously changes in the strength and stability of land C sinks over space, and provides two simple local indicators for their intricate spatial variations. These indicators could be helpful for locating the persistent terrestrial C sinks and provides valuable constraints for improving the simulation of land-atmospheric C exchanges. ","",""

Batch machine learning is often deployed for credit scoring, yet, they are tailored for static scenarios, i.e., they are not prepared to swiftly detect and adapt to changes in customer behavior, thus leading to slow recovery in such scenarios. In this paper, we bring forward an analysis on how batch machine learning can be combined with data stream mining techniques, thus leading to better recognition rates in credit scoring scenarios. We analyze three different real-world datasets from Brazilian financial institutions, whilst keeping their secrecy preserved, and show how batch and stream learning can be combined towards improved credit scoring systems, as well as highlighting relevant gaps that still require attention.","",""

Machine learning methods have been introduced for this prediction recently; however, the available experimental data used for training these predictors are biased. Abundant data are available for several frequently occurring amino acid substitutions, whereas only limited data have been accumulated for some other mutation types. Generally, current statistical models do not account for this bias toward the commoner amino acids during the encoding process and are thus less effective in making predictions on less frequently occurring mutations. In this paper, we propose a method based on support vector machines and property encoding of amino acids. The predictor we constructed outperforms other methods on the same data sets and is more robust with poor training data. The prediction accuracy for mutations with no training data exceeded 80%. This advantage is critical for practical application, where the prediction could be applied for any type of mutations. Further analysis demonstrates our model relies on biological significant features to make predictions.

Comprehensive studies are conducted on the IEEE 39-bus and IEEE 145-bus test systems to verify the performance of the proposed approach. Test results show that by using the cluster features and the proposed approach, the transient stability of the power system can be predicted accurately with a shorter training time. Furthermore, the prediction classifier is robust to unknown load levels and network topologies, especially under situations when some generator measurements are unavailable and the number of input cluster features is independent of the system scale, making the proposed approach more suitable to transient stability prediction of large-scale power systems.","",""

The first is a model-based robust nonlinear state feedback, which guarantees stability during learning, by rendering the closed-loop system input-to-state stable (ISS). The input is considered to be the error in the estimation of the uncertain parameters of the dynamics, and the state is considered to be the closed-loop output tracking error. The second component is a data-driven Bayesian optimization method for estimating the uncertain parameters of the dynamics, and improving the overall performance of the closed-loop system. In particular, we suggest using Gaussian Process Upper Confidence Bound (GP-UCB) algorithm, which is a method for trading-off exploration-exploitation in continuous-armed bandits. GP-UCB searches the space of uncertain parameters and gradually finds the parameters that maximize the performance of the closed-loop system.

The authors have investigated and developed machine learning techniques in combination with robust site and plant condition heuristics to produce a short-term generation forecast of wind power plant generation for the 5 to 7 minute timeframes to meet new requirements in the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) for wind power plant sourced unconstrained generation forecasts. Similarly, wind power plants will need reliable short term generation forecasts to be able to participate in contingency and regulation raise markets in the NEM to offset a significant increase in the generator costs for ancillary services over the last three years. The forecasting system will be implemented as a standalone device designed to integrate directly with wind power plant SCADA systems and therefore can be deployed at many new and existing wind generators. Preliminary generation forecasting results are very encouraging and already demonstrate a substantial improvement in the accuracy of short term forecasts in comparison to simple generation state estimation and market operator generated forecasts for actual wind power plant case studies for a wide range of generator sites. Accurate and timely short term forecasts will have a critical role to play in ensuring improved system stability for power systems with a large or increasing proportions of wind power plant generation.

Typically these features are used in machine learning classifiers to predict disease presence, behavior and outcome. Successful robust classifiers require features that both discriminate between classes of interest and are stable across data from multiple sites. Feature stability may be compromised by variation in slide staining and scanning procedures. These laboratory specific variables include dye batch, slice thickness and the whole slide scanner used to digitize the slide. The key therefore is to be able to identify features that are not only discriminating between the classes of interest (e.g. cancer and non-cancer or biochemical recurrence and non- recurrence) but also features that will not wildly fluctuate on slides representing the same tissue class but from across multiple different labs and sites. While there has been some recent efforts at understanding feature stability in the context of radiomics applications (i.e. feature analysis of radiographic images), relatively few attempts have been made at studying the trade-off between feature stability and discriminability for histomorphometric and digital pathology applications. In this paper we present two new measures, preparation-induced instability score (PI) and latent instability score (LI), to quantify feature instability across and within datasets. Dividing PI by LI yields a ratio for how often a feature for a specific tissue class (e.g. low grade prostate cancer) is different between datasets from different sites versus what would be expected from random chance alone. Using this ratio we seek to quantify feature vulnerability to variations in slide preparation and digitization. Since our goal is to identify stable QH features we evaluate these features for their stability and thus inclusion in machine learning based classifiers in a use case involving prostate cancer. Specifically we examine QH features which may predict 5 year biochemical recurrence for prostate cancer patients who have undergone radical prostatectomy from digital slide images of surgically excised tissue specimens, 5 year biochemical recurrence being a strong predictor of disease recurrence. In this study we evaluated the ability of our feature robustness indices to identify the most stable and predictive features of 5 year biochemical recurrence using digitized slide images of surgically excised prostate cancer specimens from 80 different patients across 4 different sites. A total of 242 features from 5 different feature families were investigated to identify the most stable QH features from our set. Our feature robustness indices (PI and LI) suggested that five feature families (graph, shape, co-occurring gland tensors, gland sub-graphs, texture) were susceptible to variations in slide preparation and digitization across various sites. The family least affected was shape features in which 19.3% of features varied across laboratories while the most vulnerable family, at 55.6%, was the gland disorder features. However the disorder features were the most stable within datasets being different between random halves of a dataset in an average of just 4.1% of comparisons while texture features were the most unstable being different at a rate of 4.7%. We also compared feature stability across two datasets before and after color normalization. Color normalization decreased feature stability with 8% and 34% of features different between the two datasets in two outcome groups prior to normalization and 49% and 51% different afterwards. Our results appear to suggest that evaluation of QH features across multiple sites needs to be undertaken to assess robustness and class discriminability alone should not represent the benchmark for selection of QH features to build diagnostic and prognostic digital pathology classifiers.","",""

Although, there has been a lot of progress in the area of grasping [1], the state-of-theart approaches may still result in failures. Ideally, the robot would detect failures quickly enough to be able to correct them. In addition, the robot should be able to learn from its mistakes to avoid similar failures in the future. To address these challenges, we propose using early grasp stability prediction during the initial phases of the grasp. We also present a machine learning method that is able to learn a regrasping behavior that corrects failed grasps based on tactile perception and improves over time. In our previous work [2], we presented a first step towards an autonomous regrasping behavior using spatio-temporal tactile features and reinforcement learning. We were able to show that simple regrasping strategies can be learned using linear policies if enough data is provided. However, these strategies do not generalize well to other classes of objects than those they were trained on. The main reason for this shortcoming is that the policies are not descriptive enough to capture the richness of different shapes and physical properties of the objects. A potential solution to learn a more complex and generalizable regrasping strategy is to employ a more complex policy class and gather a lot of real-robot data with a variety of objects to learn the policy parameters. The main weakness of such a solution is that, in addition to requiring large amounts of data, these complex policies often result in the learner becoming stuck in poor local optima [3]. In this paper, we propose learning a complex highdimensional regrasping policy in a supervised fashion. Our method uses simple linear policies to guide the general policy to avoid poor local minima and to learn the general policy from smaller amounts of data. The idea of using supervised learning in policy search has been used in [4], where the authors use trajectory optimization to direct the policy learning process and apply the learned policies to various manipulation tasks. A similar approach was proposed in [5], where the authors use deep spatial autoencoders to learn the state representation and unify a set of linear Gaussian controllers to generalize","",""

Then, a Lyapunov function is sought to certify robust stability and subsequent optimization can be performed to find optimal hyperparameter tunings.

This led to a good 90% match with laboratory ESI data. Secondly, a demulsifier selection functionality was developed based on machine learning, covering dozens type of demulsifier. We used operating conditions, fluid and demulsifier properties as training data input, with the corresponding lab bottle tests outcomes as training data output to build a classification model via supervised learning algorithms. Its predictive accuracy is at 87%.  By bringing the produced emulsion assessment from on-site to online, offshore emulsion sampling and the associated lab bottle tests are minimized. Health safety and environment (HSE) risks are reduced accordingly with the decrease of human intervention in field sampling. The emulsion stability predictive functionality enables operation to prepare early in anticipation of sudden spike of emulsion production and thus, avoiding unplanned well shut in.

The proposed metric is elaborately designed for the tracking problem by forming a margin objective function which systematically includes distance margin maximization, reconstruction error constraint, and similarity propagation techniques. The distance metric obtained helps to preserve the most discriminative information to separate the target from distracters while ensuring the stability of the optimal metric. To handle background clutter problem and achieve better tracking performance, we develop a tracker using an approximate Least Absolute Deviation (LAD)-based multi-task multi-view sparse learning method to enjoy robustness of LAD and take advantage of multiple types of visual features. The proposed method is integrated in a particle filter framework where learning the sparse representation for each view of a single particle is regarded as an individual task. The underlying relationship between tasks across different views and different particles is jointly exploited in a unified robust multi-task formulation based on LAD. In addition, to capture the frequently emerging outlier tasks, we decompose the representation matrix to two collaborative components which enable a more robust and accurate approximation. In addition, a hierarchical appearance representation model is proposed for non-rigid object tracking, based on a graphical model that exploits shared information across multiple quantization levels. The tracker aims to find the most possible position of the target by jointly classifying the pixels and superpixels and obtaining the best configuration across all levels. The motion of the bounding box is taken into consideration, while Online Random Forests are used to provide pixeland superpixel-level quantizations and progressively updated on-the-fly. Finally, inspired by the well-known Atkinson-Shiffrin Memory Model, we propose MUlti-Store Tracker, a dual-component approach consisting of shortand long-term memory stores to process target appearance memories. A powerful and efficient Integrated Correlation Filter is employed in the short-term store for short-term tracking. The integrated long-term component, which is based on keypoint matchingtracking and RANSAC estimation, can interact with the long-term memory and provide additional information for output control.","",""

Keeping in view the nonlinear electrical characteristics of the PV module as well as the power electronic interface, in this paper, a hybrid nonlinear sensorless observer based robust backstepping super-twisting sliding mode control (BSTSMC) MPPT strategy is formulated to optimize the electric power extraction from a standalone PV array, connected to a resistive load through a non-inverting DC–DC buck-boost power converter. The reference peak power voltage is generated via the Gaussian process regression (GPR) based probabilistic machine learning approach that is adequately tracked by the proposed MPPT scheme. A generalized super-twisting algorithm (GSTA) based differential flatness approach (DFA) is used to retrieve all the missing system states. The Lyapunov stability theory is used for guaranteeing the stability of the proposed closed-loop MPPT technique. The Matlab/Simulink platform is used for simulation, testing and performance validation of the proposed MPPT strategy under different weather conditions. Its MPPT performance is further compared with the recently proposed benchmark backstepping based MPPT control strategy and the conventional MPPT strategies, namely, sliding mode control (SMC), proportional integral derivative (PID) control and the perturb-and-observe (P&O) algorithm. The proposed technique is found to have a superior tracking performance in terms of offering a fast dynamic response, finite-time convergence, minute chattering, higher tracking accuracy and having more robustness against plant parametric uncertainties, load disturbances and certain time-varying sinusoidal faults occurring in the system.","",""

A generalised online sequential extreme learning machine is introduced first to identify the corresponding coefficients of actuator faults. Subsequently, a robust trajectory tracking control is developed based on MPC, where the system constraints can be effectively considered in the designed control scheme. Trajectory tracking control is achieved by controlling only the acceleration of the aerial robot in the MPC structure. This leads to less computational burden and faster closed-loop dynamics. In addition, an effective disturbance observer is employed, which can satisfactorily capture the effects of unmodelled dynamics and external disturbances on the system dynamics. The stability of the proposed control algorithm is proved based on the Lyapunov theory under realistic assumptions. Finally, the proposed control strategy is applied to a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle. Both simulation and experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the introduced fault-tolerant control scheme. The obtained results suggest that the designed control approach is capable of stabilising the attitude and providing acceptable performance in tracking a predefined trajectory in a three-dimensional environment in the simultaneous presence of actuator faults and external disturbances.","",""

First, by means of techniques from reinforcement learning and approximate/adaptive dynamic programming, we bypass the difficulty of solving exactly the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation for nonlinear systems. Instead, a recursive learning scheme known as policy iteration is introduced and its convergence is examined in great details. Second, this paper proposes the first solution to computational optimal nonlinear control i n the presence of parametric and dynamic uncertainties. Robustness to dynamic uncertainty is systematically studied using nonlinear small-gain theorems appearing in the work of one of the authors. Finally, the main results are supported by rigorous stability analysis and validated by a practic al application to a one-machine power system. It is important to notice that the proposed methodology is general and has a potential impact in other fields such as smart electric grid and systems neuroscience.","",""
