Building from early roots in the study of adaptive behavior and attempts to understand information processing in parallel and distributed neural architectures, modern neural networks have convincingly demonstrated successes in numerous areas—transforming the practice of computer vision, natural language processing, and even computational biology. Applications in robotics bring stringent constraints on size, weight and power constraints (SWaP), which challenge the developers of these technologies in new ways. Indeed, these requirements take us back to the roots of the field of neural computing, forcing us to ask how it could be that the human brain achieves with as little as 12 watts of power what seems to require entire server farms with state of the art computational and numerical methods. Likewise, even lowly insects demonstrate a degree of adaptivity and resilience that still defy easy explanation or computational replication. In this Research Topic, we have compiled the latest research addressing several aspects of these broadly defined challenge questions. As illustrated in Figure 1, the articles are organized into four prevailing themes: Sense, Think, Act, and Tools.","",""

Motivation: It is possible that classifiers are using spurious artifacts in dataset images to achieve high performances, and such explainable techniques can help identify this issue. Aim: For this purpose, several approaches were used in tandem, in order to create a complete overview of the classificatios. Methodology: The techniques used included GradCAM, LIME, RISE, Squaregrid, and direct Gradient approaches (Vanilla, Smooth, Integrated). Main results: Among the deep neural networks architectures evaluated for this image classification task, VGG16 was shown to be most affected by biases towards spurious artifacts, while DenseNet was notably more robust against them. Further impacts: Results further show that small differences in validation accuracies can cause drastic changes in explanation heatmaps for DenseNet architectures, indicating that small changes in validation accuracy may have large impacts on the biases learned by the networks. Notably, it is important to notice that the strong performance metrics achieved by all these networks (Accuracy, F1 score, AUC all in the 80 to 90% range) could give users the erroneous impression that there is no bias. However, the analysis of the explanation heatmaps highlights the bias.","",""

In crowdsourced annotation tasks we study the impact of different interpretability approaches on annotation accuracy and task time. We compare these quality metrics with classical XAI, automated quality metrics. Our results demonstrate that psychophysical experiments allow for robust quality assessment of transparency in machine learning. Interestingly the quality metrics computed without humans in the loop did not provide a consistent ranking of interpretability methods nor were they representative for how useful an explanation was for humans.

Hence, explainability is rapidly becoming a fundamental requirement of future-generation data-driven systems based on deep-learning approaches. Several attempts to fulfill the existing gap between accuracy and interpretability have been done. However, robust and specialized xAI (Explainable Artificial Intelligence) solutions tailored to deep natural-language models are still missing. We propose a new framework, named T-EBAnO, which provides innovative prediction-local and class-based model-global explanation strategies tailored to black-box deep natural-language models.

Specifically, the framework extracts sets of interpretable features mining the inner knowledge of the model. Then, it quantifies the influence of each feature during the prediction process by exploiting the novel normalized Perturbation Influence Relation index at the local level and the novel Global Absolute Influence and Global Relative Influence indexes at the global level. The effectiveness and the quality of the local and global explanations obtained with T-EBAnO are proved on (i) a sentiment analysis task performed by a fine-tuned BERT model, and (ii) a toxic comment classification task performed by an LSTM model.","",""

At the same time, researchers have tried to evaluate the explainability performance of various XAIs. However, most previous evaluation methods are human-centric, that is, subjective, where they rely on how much the results of explanation are similar to what people’s decision is based on rather than what features actually affect the decision in the model. Their XAI selections are also dependent of datasets. Furthermore, they are focusing only on the output variation of a target class. On the other hand, this paper proposes a robust heatmap assisted accuracy score (HAAS) scheme over datasets that helps selecting machine-centric explanation algorithms to show what actually leads to the decision of a given classification network. The proposed method modifies the input image with the heatmap scores obtained by a given explanation algorithm and then puts the resultant heatmap assisted (HA) images into the network to estimate the accuracy change. The resultant metric (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$HAAS$ </tex-math></inline-formula>) is computed as a ratio of accuracies of the given network over HA and original images. The proposed evaluation scheme is verified in the image classification models of LeNet-5 for MNIST and VGG-16 for CIFAR-10, STL-10, and ILSVRC2012 over totally 11 XAI algorithms of saliency map, deconvolution, and 9 layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) configurations. Consequently, for LRP1 and LRP3, MINST showed largest <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$HAAS$ </tex-math></inline-formula> values of 1.0088 and 1.0079, CIFAR-10 achieved 1.1160 and 1.1254, STL-10 had 1.0906 and 1.0918, and ILSVRC2012 got 1.3207 and 1.3469. While LRP1 consists of <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\epsilon $ </tex-math></inline-formula>-rules for input, convolutional, and fully-connected layers, LRP3 adopts a bounded-rule for an input layer and the same <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\epsilon $ </tex-math></inline-formula>-rules for other layers as LRP1. The consistency of evaluation results of HAAS and AOPC has been compared by means of Kullback-Leibler divergence, ensuring that HAAS is the more robust evaluation method than AOPC independently of datasets since HAAS has much lower average divergence of 0.0251 than AOPC of 0.3048. In addition, the validity of the proposed HAAS scheme is further investigated through the inverted HA test that employs inverted HA images made up with inverted heatmap scores and estimates the accuracy degradation caused by applying them to the network. The XAI algorithms with largest <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$HAAS$ </tex-math></inline-formula> results experience biggest accuracy degradation in the inverted HA test.","",""

We begin by presenting a domain independent EBG method, and an associated algorithm and implementation (PROLOG-EBG). The algorithm demonstrates the close relationship between EBG and resolution theorem-proving.  Despite recent progress, EBG methods exhibit an important limitation: they are incapable of determining which target concepts are useful ones to acquire. More robust generalizers must be able to automatically determine which concepts to acquire based on the purpose of the learning, since concepts acquired for one purpose may not be appropriate for another.  Our notion of the purpose of the learning is to acquire concepts which will benefit an associated performance system. Two open issues become apparent once EBG is associated with a performance system: How can EBG acquire target concepts and definitions appropriate for the performance system? Further, could the acquired target concept definitions be used to improve subsequent performance?  We focus and investigate these issues in the context of a specific type of performance system--a state-space planner. Our approach is to provide EBG with explicit knowledge of the planner and specific planning task. The purposive concept formulation and purposive explanation replay methods, respectively, provide solutions to the open problems.  We provide experimental support for these methods in the form of prototype systems.

These systems should be flexible and robust in the style of the human brain and little precompiled knowledge should be given initially. As a step toward achieving this lofty goal, this thesis presents the self-organizing event map (SOEM) architcture. The SOEM architecture seeks to provide a way in which computers can be taught, through simple observation of the world, about typical events in a way that is flexible and robust. The self-organizing event map, as a data structure, stores a plane of event models that are continually updated and organized according to events that are observed by the system. In this manner, the event map produces clusters of similar events and provides an implicit representation of the regularity within the event space to which the system has been exposed. As part of this thesis, a test system that makes use of self-organizing event map architecture has been developed in conjunction with the Genesis Project at the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) at MIT. This system receives input through a natural-language text interface and, through repreated training cycles, becomes capable of discerning between typical and exceptional events. Clusters of similar events develop within the map and these clusters act as an implicit form of the more commonly used (and explicit) notion of scripts and capability lists. For example., a trained map may recognize that dogs often run, but never fly. Therefore if a new input is received that describes a flying dog, the map would be capable of identifying the event as exceptional (or simply erroneous) and that further attention should be paid. By using clusters of similarity as an implicit representation, the self-organizing event maps presented here more accurately mimic natural memory systems and do not suffer from being tied to the limitations of a specific explicit representation of regularity.

The accurate and more reliable prediction of TDG has a very significant role in preserving the diversity of aquatic organisms and reducing the phenomenon of fish deaths. Herein, two machine learning approaches called support vector regression (SVR) and extreme learning machine (ELM) have been applied to predict the saturated TDG% at USGS 14150000 and USGS 14181500 stations which are located in the USA. For the USGS 14150000 station, the recorded samples from 13 October 2016 to 14 March 2019 (75%) were used for training set, and the rest from 15 March 2019 to 13 October 2019 (25%) were used for testing requirements. Similarly, for USGS 14181500 station, the hourly data samples which covered the period from 9 June 2017 till 11 March 2019 were used for calibrating the models and from 12 March 2019 until 9 October 2019 were used for testing the predictive models. Eight input combinations based on different parameters have been established as well as nine statistical performance measures have been used for evaluating the accuracy of adopted models, for instance, not limited, correlation of determination (        R      2        ), mean absolute relative error (MAE), and uncertainty at 95% (        U      95        ). The obtained results of the study for both stations revealed that the ELM managed efficiently to estimate the TDG in comparison to SVR technique. For USGS 14181500 station, the statistical measures for ELM (SVR) were, respectively, reported as         R      2        of 0.986 (0.986), MAE of 0.316 (0.441), and         U      95        of 3.592 (3.869). Lastly, for USGS 14181500 station, the statistical measures for ELM (SVR) were, respectively, reported as         R      2        of 0.991 (0.991), MAE of 0.338 (0.396), and         U      95        of 0.832 (0.837). In addition, ELM’s training process computational time is stated to be much shorter than that of SVM. The results also showed that the temperature parameter was the most significant variable that influenced TDG relative to the other parameters. Overall, the proposed model (ELM) proved to be an appropriate and efficient computer-assisted technology for saturated TDG modeling that will contribute to the basic knowledge of environmental considerations.","",""

In this paper, we propose backdoor trigger patterns--hidden malicious functionalities that cause misclassification--to automate the evaluation of saliency explanations. Our key observation is that triggers provide ground truth for inputs to evaluate whether the regions identified by an XAI method are truly relevant to its output. Since backdoor triggers are the most important features that cause deliberate misclassification, a robust XAI method should reveal their presence at inference time. We introduce three complementary metrics for the systematic evaluation of explanations that an XAI method generates. We evaluate seven state-of-the-art model-free and model-specific post-hoc methods through 36 models trojaned with specifically crafted triggers using color, shape, texture, location, and size.

While user studies are a known basis for evaluating XAI, studies that do not consider objective metrics for evaluating XAI may have limited meaning and may suffer from confirmation bias, particularly if they use low fidelity explanations unnecessarily. To avoid this issue, this paper suggests a paradigm shift in evaluating XAI that focuses on metrics that quantify the explanation itself and its appropriateness given the XAI goal. We suggest four such metrics based on performance differences, D, between the explanation’s logic and the agent’s actual performance, the number of rules, R, outputted by the explanation, the number of features, F , used to generate that explanation, and the stability, S, of the explanation. We believe that user studies that focus on these metrics in their evaluations are inherently more valid and should be integrated in future XAI research.","",""

SUMMARY ANSWER We have combined computer vision image processing methods and deep learning techniques to create the non-invasive Life Whisperer AI model for robust prediction of embryo viability, as measured by clinical pregnancy outcome, using single static images of Day 5 blastocysts obtained from standard optical light microscope systems. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY Embryo selection following IVF is a critical factor in determining the success of ensuing pregnancy. Traditional morphokinetic grading by trained embryologists can be subjective and variable, and other complementary techniques, such as time-lapse imaging, require costly equipment and have not reliably demonstrated predictive ability for the endpoint of clinical pregnancy. AI methods are being investigated as a promising means for improving embryo selection and predicting implantation and pregnancy outcomes. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION These studies involved analysis of retrospectively collected data including standard optical light microscope images and clinical outcomes of 8886 embryos from 11 different IVF clinics, across three different countries, between 2011 and 2018. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS The AI-based model was trained using static two-dimensional optical light microscope images with known clinical pregnancy outcome as measured by fetal heartbeat to provide a confidence score for prediction of pregnancy. Predictive accuracy was determined by evaluating sensitivity, specificity and overall weighted accuracy, and was visualized using histograms of the distributions of predictions. Comparison to embryologists’ predictive accuracy was performed using a binary classification approach and a 5-band ranking comparison. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE The Life Whisperer AI model showed a sensitivity of 70.1% for viable embryos while maintaining a specificity of 60.5% for non-viable embryos across three independent blind test sets from different clinics. The weighted overall accuracy in each blind test set was >63%, with a combined accuracy of 64.3% across both viable and non-viable embryos, demonstrating model robustness and generalizability beyond the result expected from chance. Distributions of predictions showed clear separation of correctly and incorrectly classified embryos. Binary comparison of viable/non-viable embryo classification demonstrated an improvement of 24.7% over embryologists’ accuracy (P = 0.047, n = 2, Student’s t test), and 5-band ranking comparison demonstrated an improvement of 42.0% over embryologists (P = 0.028, n = 2, Student’s t test). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION The AI model developed here is limited to analysis of Day 5 embryos; therefore, further evaluation or modification of the model is needed to incorporate information from different time points. The endpoint described is clinical pregnancy as measured by fetal heartbeat, and this does not indicate the probability of live birth. The current investigation was performed with retrospectively collected data, and hence it will be of importance to collect data prospectively to assess real-world use of the AI model. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS These studies demonstrated an improved predictive ability for evaluation of embryo viability when compared with embryologists’ traditional morphokinetic grading methods. The superior accuracy of the Life Whisperer AI model could lead to improved pregnancy success rates in IVF when used in a clinical setting. It could also potentially assist in standardization of embryo selection methods across multiple clinical environments, while eliminating the need for complex time-lapse imaging equipment. Finally, the cloud-based software application used to apply the Life Whisperer AI model in clinical practice makes it broadly applicable and globally scalable to IVF clinics worldwide.

The development of AI requires the support of many kinds of data, and microfluidic systems can often mine object data on a large scale to support AI. Due to the excellent synergy between the two technologies, excellent research results have emerged in many fields. In this review, we briefly review AI and microfluidics and introduce some applications of their combination, mainly in nanomedicine and material synthesis. Finally, we discuss the development trend of the combination of the two technologies.","",""

Explanations for machine decisions and predictions are thus needed to justify their reliability. This requires greater interpretability, which often means we need to understand the mechanism underlying the algorithms. Unfortunately, the blackbox nature of the DL is still unresolved, and many machine decisions are still poorly understood. We provide a review on interpretabilities suggested by different research works and categorize them. The different categories show different dimensions in interpretability research, from approaches that provide “obviously” interpretable information to the studies of complex patterns. By applying the same categorization to interpretability in medical research, it is hoped that: 1) clinicians and practitioners can subsequently approach these methods with caution; 2) insight into interpretability will be born with more considerations for medical practices; and 3) initiatives to push forward data-based, mathematically grounded, and technically grounded medical education are encouraged.","",""

However, their non-linear, complex structures are often difficult to interpret. Consequently, many scholars have developed a plethora of methods to explain their functioning and the logic of their inferences. This systematic review aimed to organise these methods into a hierarchical classification system that builds upon and extends existing taxonomies by adding a significant dimension—the output formats. The reviewed scientific papers were retrieved by conducting an initial search on Google Scholar with the keywords “explainable artificial intelligence”; “explainable machine learning”; and “interpretable machine learning”. A subsequent iterative search was carried out by checking the bibliography of these articles. The addition of the dimension of the explanation format makes the proposed classification system a practical tool for scholars, supporting them to select the most suitable type of explanation format for the problem at hand. Given the wide variety of challenges faced by researchers, the existing XAI methods provide several solutions to meet the requirements that differ considerably between the users, problems and application fields of artificial intelligence (AI). The task of identifying the most appropriate explanation can be daunting, thus the need for a classification system that helps with the selection of methods. This work concludes by critically identifying the limitations of the formats of explanations and by providing recommendations and possible future research directions on how to build a more generally applicable XAI method. Future work should be flexible enough to meet the many requirements posed by the widespread use of AI in several fields, and the new regulations.","",""

One extensively used method to minimize the cost and time for the drug development process is computer-aided drug design (CADD). CADD allows better focusing on experiments, which can reduce the time and cost involved in researching new drugs. In this context, structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) is robust and useful and is one of the most promising in silico techniques for drug design. SBVS attempts to predict the best interaction mode between two molecules to form a stable complex, and it uses scoring functions to estimate the force of non-covalent interactions between a ligand and molecular target. Thus, scoring functions are the main reason for the success or failure of SBVS software. Many software programs are used to perform SBVS, and since they use different algorithms, it is possible to obtain different results from different software using the same input. In the last decade, a new technique of SBVS called consensus virtual screening (CVS) has been used in some studies to increase the accuracy of SBVS and to reduce the false positives obtained in these experiments. An indispensable condition to be able to utilize SBVS is the availability of a 3D structure of the target protein. Some virtual databases, such as the Protein Data Bank, have been created to store the 3D structures of molecules. However, sometimes it is not possible to experimentally obtain the 3D structure. In this situation, the homology modeling methodology allows the prediction of the 3D structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence. This review presents an overview of the challenges involved in the use of CADD to perform SBVS, the areas where CADD tools support SBVS, a comparison between the most commonly used tools, and the techniques currently used in an attempt to reduce the time and cost in the drug development process.

However, it is unclear whether or how new approaches using advanced analytics, such as machine learning or artificial intelligence (AI), are exempt from well-known and long-standing challenges affecting clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) more generally. Vasey and colleagues4 conducted a systematic review of studies that compared clinicians’ diagnostic performance in interpreting imaging with and without the assistance of CDSS interventions based on machine learning.5 Of the 37 studies evaluated, most pertained to diagnosis of cancer or lung pathology and more than half assessed commercial CDSS technology. The authors found no robust evidence that clinicians made better diagnostic decisions when provided with support from machine-learning algorithms, suggesting that AI-based CDSSs are far from achieving their potential. This finding is similar for essentially all forms of AI-based decision support systems that have been evaluated to date. One explanation is that data amassed as part of providing usual care are, by their nature, messy and complex.1 Observational data are invariably deeply confounded in ways that will produce misleading associations because of selection bias, confounding by indication, immortal time bias, and observation-time bias. Additionally, data in electronic health records are entered by busy people with varying priorities on the information that they enter into the records and where, when, and how they enter that information. In clinical care, lack of documentation of a diagnosis, problem, finding, communication, or even an action does not constitute evidence that it did not exist or occur. The computer only knows what it is told—missing data and the meaning of gaps are informative but often are unknowable and may lead to further imprecision in AI-based CDSSs. A CDSS based on algorithms that are based on confounded or incomplete data will be confounded and provide inaccurate guidance. Even with big numbers and advanced modeling algorithms, predicting rare events is a fundamentally tough business, particularly when trying to predict a patient’s outcome or risks. All too often, investigators and those building AI-based CDSSs tout use of data from massive numbers of patients even as the actual event rate is low (eg, only 1 or 2%), which means that even when the area under the curve is as high as 0.9, the positive predictive value may not exceed 0.1, and the resulting false alarms will greatly outnumber true signals.6 Moreover, there is no agreement on the best metrics to categorize the performance of predictive algorithms. Metrics have included area under the receiver operating curve, confusion matrix, accuracy, positive predictive value/precision, recall/ sensitivity, precision-recall curve, specificity, negative predictive value, F1 score, number needed to screen, likelihood ratio, net reclassification index, stratification tables, and calibration curves. In addition, model performance inevitably degrades over time (because of population drift or more commonly, alterations in the underlying data structure) and when applied to data emanating from a different system or setting. Many experts now advocate not only that models be tested on multiple independent data sets, but that testing be conducted by independent investigators.6 + Related article","",""

The word-of-machine effect stems from a lay belief that AI recommenders are more competent than human recommenders in the utilitarian realm and less competent than human recommenders in the hedonic realm. As a consequence, importance or salience of utilitarian attributes determine preference for AI recommenders over human ones, and importance or salience of hedonic attributes determine resistance to AI recommenders over human ones (Studies 1–4). The word-of machine effect is robust to attribute complexity, number of options considered, and transaction costs. The word-of-machine effect reverses for utilitarian goals if a recommendation needs matching to a person’s unique preferences (Study 5) and is eliminated in the case of human–AI hybrid decision making (i.e., augmented rather than artificial intelligence; Study 6).

The adoption of probabilistic and decision-theoretic representations and statistical learning methods has led to a large degree of integration and cross-fertilization among AI, machine learning, statistics, control theory, neuroscience, and other fields. The establishment of shared theoretical frameworks, combined with the availability of data and processing power, has yielded remarkable successes in various component tasks such as speech recognition, image classification, autonomous vehicles, machine translation, legged locomotion, and question-answering systems. As capabilities in these areas and others cross the threshold from laboratory research to economically valuable technologies, a virtuous cycle takes hold whereby even small improvements in performance are worth large sums of money, prompting greater investments in research. There is now a broad consensus that AI research is progressing steadily, and that its impact on society is likely to increase. The potential benefits are huge, since everything that civilization has to offer is a product of human intelligence; we cannot predict what we might achieve when this intelligence is magnified by the tools AI may provide, but the eradication of disease and poverty are not unfathomable. Because of the great potential of AI, it is important to research how to reap its benefits while avoiding potential pitfalls.

Therefore, the objective of this study was to develop a predictive tool for estimating RHOB while drilling using an adaptive network-based fuzzy interference system (ANFIS), functional network (FN), and support vector machine (SVM). The proposed model uses the mechanical drilling constraints as feeding input parameters, and the conventional RHOB log data as an output parameter. These mechanical drilling parameters are usually measured while drilling, and their responses vary with different formations. A dataset of 2400 actual datapoints, obtained from a horizontal well in the Middle East, were used to build the proposed models. The obtained dataset was divided into a 70/30 ratio for model training and testing, respectively. The optimized ANFIS-based model outperformed the FN- and SVM-based models with a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.93, and average absolute percentage error (AAPE) of 0.81% between the predicted and measured RHOB values. These results demonstrate the reliability of the developed ANFIS model for predicting RHOB while drilling, based on the mechanical drilling parameters. Subsequently, the ANFIS-based model was validated using unseen data from another well within the same field. The validation process yielded an AAPE of 0.97% between the predicted and actual RHOB values, which confirmed the robustness of the developed model as an effective predictive tool for RHOB.","",""

For training, data must be appropriately valued, and deals with AI companies must be centralized. Companies must clearly define anonymization and consent, and patients must be well-informed about their data usage. Data fed into algorithms must be made AI-ready by refining, purification, digitization and centralization. Finally, data must represent various demographics. AI needs to be safely integrated with radiologists-in-the-loop: guiding forming concepts of AI solutions and supervising training and feedback. To be well-regulated, AI systems must be approved by a health authority and agreements must be made upon liability for errors, roles of supervised and unsupervised AI and fair workforce distribution (between AI and radiologists), with a renewal of policy at regular intervals. Any errors made must have a root-cause analysis, with outcomes fedback to companies to close the loop—thus enabling a dynamic best prediction system.

Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) are the Artificial Intelligence techniques that have been attracting interest due to their flexibility to account for various data patterns. Both are black-box models which are sensitive to hyperparameter settings. Feature selection can be performed on SVM to enable explanation with the reduced features, whereas feature importance computed by RF can be used for model explanation. The benefits of accuracy and interpretation allow for significant improvement in the area of credit risk and credit scoring. This paper proposes the use of Harmony Search (HS), to form a hybrid HS-SVM to perform feature selection and hyperparameter tuning simultaneously, and a hybrid HS-RF to tune the hyperparameters. A Modified HS (MHS) is also proposed with the main objective to achieve comparable results as the standard HS with a shorter computational time. MHS consists of four main modifications in the standard HS: (i) Elitism selection during memory consideration instead of random selection, (ii) dynamic exploration and exploitation operators in place of the original static operators, (iii) a self-adjusted bandwidth operator, and (iv) inclusion of additional termination criteria to reach faster convergence. Along with parallel computing, MHS effectively reduces the computational time of the proposed hybrid models. The proposed hybrid models are compared with standard statistical models across three different datasets commonly used in credit scoring studies. The computational results show that MHS-RF is most robust in terms of model performance, model explainability and computational time.","",""

Yet, the explosion of nonstandardized reporting of high-performing algorithms are rendered useless without robust and streamlined implementation guidelines. The development of protocols and checklists will accelerate the translation of research publications to impact on patient care.   RECENT FINDINGS Beyond technological scepticism, we lack uniformity in analysing algorithmic performance generalizability, and benchmarking impacts across clinical settings. No regulatory guardrails have been set to minimize bias or optimize interpretability; no consensus clinical acceptability thresholds or systematized postdeployment monitoring has been set. Moreover, stakeholders with misaligned incentives deepen the landscape complexity especially when it comes to the requisite data integration and harmonization to advance the field. Therefore, despite increasing algorithmic accuracy and commoditization, the infamous 'implementation gap' persists. Open clinical data repositories have been shown to rapidly accelerate research, minimize redundancies and disseminate the expertise and knowledge required to overcome existing barriers. Drawing upon the longstanding success of existing governance frameworks and robust data use and sharing agreements, the ophthalmic community has tremendous opportunity in ushering artificial intelligence into medicine. By collaboratively building a powerful resource of open, anonymized multimodal ophthalmic data, the next generation of clinicians can advance data-driven eye care in unprecedented ways.   SUMMARY This piece demonstrates that with readily accessible data, immense progress can be achieved clinically and methodologically to realize artificial intelligence's impact on clinical care. Exponentially progressive network effects can be seen by consolidating, curating and distributing data amongst both clinicians and data scientists.","",""

It was observed that artificial intelligent methods have made remarkable contributions to combating cybercrimes with significant improvement in intrusion detection systems. It was also observed that there is a reduction in computational complexity, model training times and false alarms. However, there is a significant skewness within the domain. Most studies have focused on intrusion detection and prevention systems, and the most dominant technique used was support vector machines.

We first investigate the ratio legis of the transparency requirement in the General Data Protection Regulation and its ethical underpinnings, showing its focus on the provision of information and explanation. We then discuss the pitfalls with respect to this requirement by focusing on the significance of contextual and performative factors in the implementation of transparency. We show that human–computer interaction and human-robot interaction literature do not provide clear results with respect to the benefits of transparency for users of artificial intelligence technologies due to the impact of a wide range of contextual factors, including performative aspects. We conclude by integrating the information- and explanation-based approach to transparency with the critical contextual approach, proposing that transparency as required by the General Data Protection Regulation in itself may be insufficient to achieve the positive goals associated with transparency. Instead, we propose to understand transparency relationally, where information provision is conceptualized as communication between technology providers and users, and where assessments of trustworthiness based on contextual factors mediate the value of transparency communications. This relational concept of transparency points to future research directions for the study of transparency in artificial intelligence systems and should be taken into account in policymaking.","",""

DARPA’s explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) program endeavors to create AI systems whose learned models and decisions can be understood and appropriately trusted by end users. Realizing this goal requires methods for learning more explainable models, designing effective explanation interfaces, and understanding the psychologic requirements for effective explanations. TheXAI developer teams are addressing the first two challenges by creating ML techniques and developing principles, strategies, and human-computer interaction techniques for generating effective explanations. Another XAI team is addressing the third challenge by summarizing, extending, and applying psychologic theories of explanation to help the XAI evaluator define a suitable evaluation framework, which the developer teams will use to test their systems. The XAI teams completed the first of this 4-year program in May 2018. In a series of ongoing evaluations, the developer teams are assessing how well their XAM systems’ explanations improve user understanding, user trust, and user task performance. Advances inmachine learning (ML) techniques promise to produce AI systems that perceive, learn, decide, and act on their own. However, they will be unable to explain their decisions and actions to human users. This lack is especially important for the Department of Defense, whose challenges require developingmore intelligent, autonomous, and symbiotic systems. Explainable AI will be essential if users are to understand, appropriately trust, and effectively manage these artificially intelligent partners. To address this, DARPA launched its explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) program in May 2017. DARPA defines explainable AI as AI systems that can explain their rationale to a human user, characterize their strengths and weaknesses, and convey an understanding of how theywill behave in the future. Naming this program explainable AI (rather than interpretable, comprehensible, or transparent AI, for example) reflects DARPA’s objective to create more human-understandable AI systems through the use of effective explanations.

The datasets were labelled using a three-step strategy: (1) capture mode recognition; (2) cataract diagnosis as a normal lens, cataract or a postoperative eye and (3) detection of referable cataracts with respect to aetiology and severity. Moreover, we integrated the cataract AI agent with a real-world multilevel referral pattern involving self-monitoring at home, primary healthcare and specialised hospital services. Results The universal AI platform and multilevel collaborative pattern showed robust diagnostic performance in three-step tasks: (1) capture mode recognition (area under the curve (AUC) 99.28%–99.71%), (2) cataract diagnosis (normal lens, cataract or postoperative eye with AUCs of 99.82%, 99.96% and 99.93% for mydriatic-slit lamp mode and AUCs >99% for other capture modes) and (3) detection of referable cataracts (AUCs >91% in all tests).

Surgical correction has proven to be effective in achieving improvement of spinopelvic parameters as well as improving quality of life (QoL) for these patients. However, given the relatively high complication risk associated with ASD correction, it is of paramount importance to develop robust prognostic tools for predicting risk profile and outcomes. Historically, statistical models such as linear and logistic regression models were used to identify preoperative factors associated with postoperative outcomes. While these tools were useful for looking at simple associations, they represent generalizations across large populations, with little applicability to individual patients. More recently, predictive analytics utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) through machine learning for comprehensive processing of large amounts of data have become available for surgeons to implement. The use of these computational techniques has given surgeons the ability to leverage far more accurate and individualized predictive tools to better inform individual patients regarding predicted outcomes after ASD correction surgery. Applications range from predicting QoL measures to predicting the risk of major complications, hospital readmission, and reoperation rates. In addition, AI has been used to create a novel classification system for ASD patients, which will help surgeons identify distinct patient subpopulations with unique risk-benefit profiles.

Overall, there appears to be no clear relationship between AI exposure and employment growth. However, in occupations where computer use is high, greater exposure to AI is linked to higher employment growth. The paper also finds suggestive evidence of a negative relationship between AI exposure and growth in average hours worked among occupations where computer use is low. One possible explanation is that partial automation by AI increases productivity directly as well as by shifting the task composition of occupations toward higher value-added tasks. This increase in labor productivity and output counteracts the direct displacement effect of automation through AI for workers with good digital skills, who may find it easier to use AI effectively and shift to non-automatable, higher-value added tasks within their occupations.

Additionally, clinical trials involving AI in participatory health contexts registered at clinicaltrials.gov were collected and analyzed. Results : Twenty-two articles and 12 trials were selected for review. The most common application of AI in participatory health was the secondary analysis of social media data: self-reported data including patient experiences with healthcare facilities, reports of adverse drug reactions, safety and efficacy concerns about over-the-counter medications, and other perspectives on medications. Other application areas included determining which online forum threads required moderator assistance, identifying users who were likely to drop out from a forum, extracting terms used in an online forum to learn its vocabulary, highlighting contextual information that is missing from online questions and answers, and paraphrasing technical medical terms for consumers.

Due to the high complexity of genomic data, AI techniques are increasingly needed to help reduce this and aid the adoption of optimal decisions. Phenotypic prediction is of particular use to drug discovery and precision medicine where sets of genes that predict a given phenotype are determined. Phenotypic prediction is an undetermined problem given that the number of monitored genetic probes markedly exceeds the number of collected samples (from patients). This imbalance creates ambiguity in the characterization of the biological pathways that are responsible for disease development. Areas covered: In this paper, the authors present AI methodologies that perform a robust deep sampling of altered genetic pathways to locate new therapeutic targets, assist in drug repurposing and speed up and optimize the drug selection process. Expert opinion: AI is a potential solution to a number of drug discovery problems, though one should, bear in mind that the quality of data predicts the overall quality of the prediction, as in any modeling task in data science. The use of transparent methodologies is crucial, particularly in drug repositioning/repurposing in rare diseases.","",""

It is desirable to develop automatic and accurate detection of COVID-19 using chest CT. Purpose To develop a fully automatic framework to detect COVID-19 using chest CT and evaluate its performance. Materials and Methods In this retrospective and multicenter study, a deep learning model, the COVID-19 detection neural network (COVNet), was developed to extract visual features from volumetric chest CT scans for the detection of COVID-19. CT scans of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and other non-pneumonia abnormalities were included to test the robustness of the model. The datasets were collected from six hospitals between August 2016 and February 2020. Diagnostic performance was assessed with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, and specificity. Results The collected dataset consisted of 4352 chest CT scans from 3322 patients. The average patient age (±standard deviation) was 49 years ± 15, and there were slightly more men than women (1838 vs 1484, respectively; P = .29). The per-scan sensitivity and specificity for detecting COVID-19 in the independent test set was 90% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 83%, 94%; 114 of 127 scans) and 96% (95% CI: 93%, 98%; 294 of 307 scans), respectively, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.96 (P < .001). The per-scan sensitivity and specificity for detecting CAP in the independent test set was 87% (152 of 175 scans) and 92% (239 of 259 scans), respectively, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.95 (95% CI: 0.93, 0.97).

An AI based deselection model was able to predict implantation failure based on morphokinetic features previously found to associate with aneuploidy.        Aneuploidy is the most common explanation for implantation failure of high-quality blastocysts. Yet, high-quality blastocysts with unknown ploidy that fail to implant are often morphologically indistinguishable from blastocysts that succeed to implant. Our previously published results (ESHRE 2021) demonstrated that aneuploid blastocysts were more likely to reach development events (t2-t8) later, and that the timing between each event was statistically longer (p < 0.001), when compared to euploid embryos. Given that delayed morphokinetic rates are tightly linked to ploidy, we investigated whether similar known morphokinetic features were associated with implantation failure in top-graded embryos.        Time-lapse sequences of 3,259 top-quality blastocysts from fresh single embryo transfer cycles with known implantation outcomes were analyzed using an AI-based algorithm. The algorithm utilized convolutional neural network extracted temporal features based on multiple morphokinetic parameters known to associate with ploidy.        time-lapse sequences and morphokinetic events were algorithmically analyzed to measure the rate of mitotic division events and compare the number of embryos in each category (implanted/nonimplanted) that reached each developmental event at least one standard deviation (SD) later than the mean for implanted embryos.        Results showed statistical differences in the following morphokinetic features between the two categories: t2, t3, t4, and t3-t4 (p < 0.05). Implanted top-graded blastocysts were likely to reach t2, t3, and t4 after 25.23 ± 3.8 SD, 36.06 ± 3.4 SD, and 37.14 hours ±3.6 SD, respectively. The time gap between t3 and t4 was found to be 12.25 hours ± 5.31 SD. Given this, we followed the methodology described above to propose cutoff values (in hours) that differentiated between non-implanted and implanted top-graded blastocysts based on their morphokinetic profiles. Implantation failure was found to be associated with the likelihood of reaching t2 after 28.61 hours (OR = 2.36, CI 0.96-5.77), t3 after 39.46 (OR = 3.48, CI 1.62-7.47), and t4 after 40.79 hours (OR = 2.23, CI 1.09- 4.53). A time gap between t3 and t4 of more than 17.56 hours was also associated with implantation failure (OR = 2.48, CI 1.12-5.48), indicating perturbed mitotic activity. The cutoff values proposed here were incorporated into the algorithm for optimized deselection of morphologically similar top-quality blastocysts with delayed morphokinetic profiles.        This study needs to be validated on a larger, multi-centric dataset that takes into account more morphokinetic features associated with ploidy in order to increase the robustness of our algorithm.        For the first time, our algorithmic model proposed here demonstrates the utility of an AI tool to deselect top-graded blastocysts that would otherwise be selected for transfer based on conventional morphologic assessment alone.

We address this challenge by adapting explainable artificial intelligence to the context of quality management. Specifically, we propose the use of nonlinear modeling with Shapley additive explanations to infer how a set of production parameters and the process quality of a manufacturing system are related. Thereby, we contribute a measure of process importance based on which manufacturers can prioritize processes for quality improvement. Grounded in quality management theory, our decision model selects improvement actions that target the sources of quality variation. The decision model is validated in a real-world application at a leading manufacturer of high-power semiconductors. Seeking to improve production yield, we apply our decision model to select improvement actions for a transistor chip product. We then conduct a field experiment to confirm the effectiveness of the improvement actions. Compared with the average yield in our sample, the experiment returns a reduction in yield loss of 21.7%.

A DSS can be successful if large amounts of interactive data proceed fast and robustly and extract useful information and knowledge to help decision-making. In this context, the data-driven approach has gained prominence due to its provision of insights for decision-making and easy implementation. The data-driven approach can discover various database patterns without relying on prior knowledge while also handling flexible objectives and multiple scenarios. This chapter reviews recent advances in data-driven optimization, highlighting the promise of data-driven optimization that integrates mathematical programming and machine learning (ML) for decision-making under uncertainty and identifies potential research opportunities. This chapter provides guidelines and implications for researchers, managers, and practitioners in operations research who want to advance their decision-making capabilities under uncertainty concerning data-driven optimization. Then, a comprehensive review and classification of the relevant publications on the data-driven stochastic program, data-driven robust optimization, and data-driven chance-constrained are presented. This chapter also identifies fertile avenues for future research that focus on deep-data-driven optimization, deep data-driven models, as well as online learning-based data-driven optimization. Perspectives on reinforcement learning (RL)-based data-driven optimization and deep RL for solving NP-hard problems are discussed. We investigate the application of data-driven optimization in different case studies to demonstrate improvements in operational performance over conventional optimization methodology.

Objective The purpose of this systematic literature review was to identify and analyze quantitative studies utilizing or integrating AI to address and report clinical-level patient safety outcomes. Methods We restricted our search to the PubMed, PubMed Central, and Web of Science databases to retrieve research articles published in English between January 2009 and August 2019. We focused on quantitative studies that reported positive, negative, or intermediate changes in patient safety outcomes using AI apps, specifically those based on machine-learning algorithms and natural language processing. Quantitative studies reporting only AI performance but not its influence on patient safety outcomes were excluded from further review. Results We identified 53 eligible studies, which were summarized concerning their patient safety subcategories, the most frequently used AI, and reported performance metrics. Recognized safety subcategories were clinical alarms (n=9; mainly based on decision tree models), clinical reports (n=21; based on support vector machine models), and drug safety (n=23; mainly based on decision tree models). Analysis of these 53 studies also identified two essential findings: (1) the lack of a standardized benchmark and (2) heterogeneity in AI reporting. Conclusions This systematic review indicates that AI-enabled decision support systems, when implemented correctly, can aid in enhancing patient safety by improving error detection, patient stratification, and drug management. Future work is still needed for robust validation of these systems in prospective and real-world clinical environments to understand how well AI can predict safety outcomes in health care settings.","",""

Here, we evaluated the performance of Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Networks for automated image analysis, using a global coral reef monitoring dataset. The study demonstrates the advantages of automated image analysis for coral reef monitoring in terms of error and repeatability of benthic abundance estimations, as well as cost and benefit. We found unbiased and high agreement between expert and automated observations (97%). Repeated surveys and comparisons against existing monitoring programs also show that automated estimation of benthic composition is equally robust in detecting change and ensuring the continuity of existing monitoring data. Using this automated approach, data analysis and reporting can be accelerated by at least 200x and at a fraction of the cost (1%). Combining commonly used underwater imagery in monitoring with automated image annotation can dramatically improve how we measure and monitor coral reefs worldwide, particularly in terms of allocating limited resources, rapid reporting and data integration within and across management areas.","",""

Assistive AI achieves accuracy comparable to or even surpassing that of human experts.

This is why the AI research community has been focusing on rendering AI decisions more transparent by providing explanations of an AIs decision. To what extent these explanations really help to foster trust into an AI system remains an open question. In this paper, we report the results of a behavioural experiment in which subjects were able to draw on the support of an ML-based decision support tool for text classification. We experimentally varied the information subjects received and show that transparency can actually have a negative impact on trust.

However, data-driven AI models unequivocally suffer from a lack of sufficiently large and unbiased datasets. Here, we systematically investigated the data biases on the PDBbind and DUD-E datasets. We examined the model performance of atomic convolutional neural network (ACNN) on the PDBbind core set and achieved a Pearson R2 of 0.73 between experimental and predicted binding affinities. Strikingly, the ACNN models did not require learning the essential protein-ligand interactions in complex structures and achieved similar performance even on datasets containing only ligand structures or only protein structures, while data splitting based on similarity clustering (protein sequence or ligand scaffold) significantly reduced the model performance. We also identified the property and topology biases in the DUD-E dataset which led to the artificially increased enrichment performance of virtual screening. The property bias in DUD-E was reduced by enforcing the more stringent ligand property matching rules, while the topology bias still exists due to the use of molecular fingerprint similarity as a decoy selection criterion. Therefore, we believe that sufficiently large and unbiased datasets are desirable for training robust AI models to accurately predict protein-ligand interactions.","",""

However, health care has been relatively late to adopt them. This article provides clinical examples in which machine learning and artificial intelligence are already in use in health care and appear to deliver benefit. Three key bottlenecks toward increasing the pace of diffusion and adoption are methodological issues in evaluation of artificial intelligence-based interventions, reporting standards to enable assessment of model performance, and issues that need to be addressed for an institution to adopt these interventions. Methodological best practices will include external validation, ideally at a different site; use of proactive learning algorithms to correct for site-specific biases and increase robustness as algorithms are deployed across multiple sites; addressing subgroup performance; and communicating to providers the uncertainty of predictions. Regarding reporting, especially important issues are the extent to which implementing standardized approaches for introducing clinical decision support has been followed, describing the data sources, reporting on data assumptions, and addressing biases. Although most health care organizations in the United States have adopted electronic health records, they may be ill prepared to adopt machine learning and artificial intelligence. Several steps can enable this: preparing data, developing tools to get suggestions to clinicians in useful ways, and getting clinicians engaged in the process. Open challenges and the role of regulation in this area are briefly discussed.

We focus on two aspects of clinical artificial intelligence used for decision-making: moral accountability for harm to patients; and safety assurance to protect patients against such harm. Artificial intelligence-based tools are challenging the standard clinical practices of assigning blame and assuring safety. Human clinicians and safety engineers have weaker control over the decisions reached by artificial intelligence systems and less knowledge and understanding of precisely how the artificial intelligence systems reach their decisions. We illustrate this analysis by applying it to an example of an artificial intelligence-based system developed for use in the treatment of sepsis. The paper ends with practical suggestions for ways forward to mitigate these concerns. We argue for a need to include artificial intelligence developers and systems safety engineers in our assessments of moral accountability for patient harm. Meanwhile, none of the actors in the model robustly fulfil the traditional conditions of moral accountability for the decisions of an artificial intelligence system. We should therefore update our conceptions of moral accountability in this context. We also need to move from a static to a dynamic model of assurance, accepting that considerations of safety are not fully resolvable during the design of the artificial intelligence system before the system has been deployed.","",""

To achieve the promoted benefits of a symptom checker, laypeople must trust and subsequently follow its instructions. In AI, explanations are seen as a tool to communicate the rationale behind black-box decisions to encourage trust and adoption. However, the effectiveness of the types of explanations used in AI-driven symptom checkers has not yet been studied. Explanations can follow many forms, including why-explanations and how-explanations. Social theories suggest that why-explanations are better at communicating knowledge and cultivating trust among laypeople. Objective The aim of this study is to ascertain whether explanations provided by a symptom checker affect explanatory trust among laypeople and whether this trust is impacted by their existing knowledge of disease. Methods A cross-sectional survey of 750 healthy participants was conducted. The participants were shown a video of a chatbot simulation that resulted in the diagnosis of either a migraine or temporal arteritis, chosen for their differing levels of epidemiological prevalence. These diagnoses were accompanied by one of four types of explanations. Each explanation type was selected either because of its current use in symptom checkers or because it was informed by theories of contrastive explanation. Exploratory factor analysis of participants’ responses followed by comparison-of-means tests were used to evaluate group differences in trust. Results Depending on the treatment group, two or three variables were generated, reflecting the prior knowledge and subsequent mental model that the participants held. When varying explanation type by disease, migraine was found to be nonsignificant (P=.65) and temporal arteritis, marginally significant (P=.09). Varying disease by explanation type resulted in statistical significance for input influence (P=.001), social proof (P=.049), and no explanation (P=.006), with counterfactual explanation (P=.053). The results suggest that trust in explanations is significantly affected by the disease being explained. When laypeople have existing knowledge of a disease, explanations have little impact on trust. Where the need for information is greater, different explanation types engender significantly different levels of trust. These results indicate that to be successful, symptom checkers need to tailor explanations to each user’s specific question and discount the diseases that they may also be aware of. Conclusions System builders developing explanations for symptom-checking apps should consider the recipient’s knowledge of a disease and tailor explanations to each user’s specific need. Effort should be placed on generating explanations that are personalized to each user of a symptom checker to fully discount the diseases that they may be aware of and to close their information gap.","",""

This paper reviews the pertinent aspects of AI in obstetrics and gynecology (OB/GYN) and how these can be applied to improve patient outcomes and reduce the healthcare costs and workload for clinicians. Herein, we will address current AI uses in OB/GYN, and the use of AI as a tool to interpret fetal heart rate (FHR) and cardiotocography (CTG) to aid in the detection of preterm labor, pregnancy complications, and review discrepancies in its interpretation between clinicians to reduce maternal and infant morbidity and mortality. AI systems can be used as tools to create algorithms identifying asymptomatic women with short cervical length who are at risk of preterm birth. Additionally, the benefits of using the vast data capacity of AI storage can assist in determining the risk factors for preterm labor using multiomics and extensive genomic data. In the field of gynecological surgery, the use of augmented reality helps surgeons detect vital structures, thus decreasing complications, reducing operative time, and helping surgeons in training to practice in a realistic setting. Using three-dimensional (3D) printers can provide materials that mimic real tissues and also helps trainees to practice on a realistic model. Furthermore, 3D imaging allows better depth perception than its two-dimensional (2D) counterpart, allowing the surgeon to create preoperative plans according to tissue depth and dimensions. Although AI has some limitations, this new technology can improve the prognosis and management of patients, reduce healthcare costs, and help OB/GYN practitioners to reduce their workload and increase their efficiency and accuracy by incorporating AI systems into their daily practice. AI has the potential to guide practitioners in decision-making, reaching a diagnosis, and improving case management. It can reduce healthcare costs by decreasing medical errors and providing more dependable predictions. AI systems can accurately provide information on the large array of patients in clinical settings, although more robust data is required.","",""

However, AI implication remains intricate for researchers/clinicians lacking specific training in computational tools and informatics. Cancer is a major cause of death worldwide, accounting for an estimated 9.6 million deaths in 2018. Certain cancers, such as pancreatic and gastric cancers, are detected only after they have reached their advanced stages with frequent relapses. Cancer is one of the most complex diseases affecting a range of organs with diverse disease progression mechanisms and the effectors ranging from gene-epigenetics to a wide array of metabolites. Hence a comprehensive study, including genomics, epi-genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, along with the medical/mass-spectrometry imaging, patient clinical history, treatments provided, genetics, and disease endemicity, is essential. Cancer Moonshot℠ Research Initiatives by NIH National Cancer Institute aims to collect as much information as possible from different regions of the world and make a cancer data repository. AI could play an immense role in (a) analysis of complex and heterogeneous data sets (multi-omics and/or inter-omics), (b) data integration to provide a holistic disease molecular mechanism, (c) identification of diagnostic and prognostic markers, and (d) monitor patient’s response to drugs/treatments and recovery.

Stronger effects are shown by social values and general attitudes to science. Those expressing egalitarian values and privacy concerns, as well as those less predisposed to innovation in a general sense, are more prone to oppose both technological applications. Lastly, we found evidence that, as in other complex technological applications, a new cognitive shortcut is produced.

These include a variety of sensitive applications such as healthcare, finance, autonomous driving, criminal justice, and others which all pose significant concerns for fairness, robustness, safety, and trustworthiness. Despite these applications to critical tasks, deep networks are infamously referred to as black-box models because of their total lack of transparency in decision-making. If we are able to gain insight into how a model is coming to its conclusions, we are able to more clearly assess the trustworthiness and validity of its decisions. Consequently, an abundance of ongoing research is attempting to address model interpretability as the key problem to resolving these issues. There are many methods which are currently used to provide explanations of complex model predictions. LIME (Ribeiro et al., 2016) fits a local linear model around a data point, showing which features positively and negatively influence the prediction results. Despite the overall model being nonlinear, the local model gets an interpretable picture of how the model looks at small scales around the data point. Extensions of this method use other interpretable models like small decision tress. Shapley Values and SHAP follows a similar idea to assign a score to each feature, using a gametheoretic formulation which treats each feature as a player causing the final prediction (Lundberg and Lee, 2017). Its more rigorous formulation yields guarantees of its explanations summing up to the prediction score, but practically it usually must be estimated because of its high computational cost. Shuffle-based feature importance permutes the data of each feature to ascertain its importance in the final prediction in comparison to its normal prediction (Fisher et al., 2018). IG uses the fundamental theorem of calculus to provide additive explanations of a prediction (Sundararajan et al., 2017). This method is very popular in computer vision where its computational efficiency and saliency are prized, even though other work has exposed some of its shortcomings in providing an interpretation (Adebayo et al., 2018). Other methods are specifically designed for computer vision like TCAV (Kim et al., 2018) which finds a ‘concept direction’ corresponding to a large sample of concept images from the user. Surprisingly, all of these most popular interpretability methods share the same one limitation. None of these methods consider the shared importance of groups of two or more features; they only look at the effects had by each of the features individually. A feature interaction between two variables broadly describes a situation where both of the features/ variables are simultaneously important for a model’s prediction. In text applications for sentiment, ”not good” is a very simple example of two words strongly interacting with one another to create a negative sentiment. In modern-day applications, neural networks are usually hailed as amazing function approximators exactly because of their incredible ability to automatically uncover these kinds of complex relationships between the variables of the dataset.

Usually AC loss is calculated for pure sinusoidal current, while it is no longer accurate when current is nonsinusoidal. On the other hand, efficiency of cooling system in large scale power devices is dependent on accurate estimation and prediction of the heat load caused by AC loss in design stage. Therefore, estimation of nonsinusoidal AC loss of high temperature superconducting (HTS) material would be of great interest for designers of large-scale superconducting devices. In this paper, at first nonsinusoidal AC loss of a typical HTS tape was calculated under distorted currents using H-formulation finite element method. Then, a range of artificial intelligence (AI) models were implemented to predict AC loss of a typical HTS tape. In order to find the best and more adaptive AI model for nonsinusoidal AC loss prediction, different regression models are evaluated using Support Vector Machine regression model, Generalized Linear regression model, Decision Tree regression model, Feed Forward Neural Network based model, Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System based model, and Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) based model. In order to evaluate robustness of developed models cross-validation technique is implemented on experimental data. To compare the performance of different AI models, four prediction measures were used: Theil’s U coefficients (U_Accuracy and U_Quality), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Regression value (R-value). Obtained results show that best performance belongs to RBFNN based model and then ANFIS based model. U coefficients and RMSE values are obtained less than 0.005 and R-Value is become close to one by using RBFNN based model for testing data, which indicates high accuracy prediction performance.","",""

Published studies were presented from two points of view: What medical aspects were covered? What AI/ML algorithms have been used? Methods We searched four electronic databases or studies that used AI/ML in hemodialysis (HD), peritoneal dialysis (PD), and kidney transplantation (KT). Sixty-nine studies were split into three categories: AI/ML and HD, PD, and KT, respectively. We identified 43 trials in the first group, 8 in the second, and 18 in the third. Then, studies were classified according to the type of algorithm. Results AI and HD trials covered: (a) dialysis service management, (b) dialysis procedure, (c) anemia management, (d) hormonal/dietary issues, and (e) arteriovenous fistula assessment. PD studies were divided into (a) peritoneal technique issues, (b) infections, and (c) cardiovascular event prediction. AI in transplantation studies were allocated into (a) management systems (ML used as pretransplant organ-matching tools), (b) predicting graft rejection, (c) tacrolimus therapy modulation, and (d) dietary issues. Conclusions Although guidelines are reluctant to recommend AI implementation in daily practice, there is plenty of evidence that AI/ML algorithms can predict better than nephrologists: volumes, Kt/V, and hypotension or cardiovascular events during dialysis. Altogether, these trials report a robust impact of AI/ML on quality of life and survival in G5D/T patients. In the coming years, one would probably witness the emergence of AI/ML devices that facilitate the management of dialysis patients, thus increasing the quality of life and survival.","",""

Unfortunately, the pursuit and use of such therapies have been hindered by a common challenge: patients with specific rare diseases are difficult to identify, especially if the conditions resemble more prevalent disorders. Cardiac amyloidosis is one such rare disease, which is characterized by deposition of misfolded proteins within the heart muscle resulting in heart failure and death. In recent years, specific therapies have emerged for cardiac amyloidosis and several more are under investigation, but because cardiac amyloidosis is mistaken for common forms of heart failure, it is typically diagnosed late in its course. As a possible solution, artificial intelligence methods could enable automated detection of rare diseases, but model performance must address low disease prevalence. Here we present an automated multi-modality pipeline for cardiac amyloidosis detection using two neural-network models; one using electrocardiograms (ECG) and the second using echocardiographic videos as input. These models were trained and validated on 3 and 5 academic medical centers (AMC), respectively, in the United States and Japan. Both models had excellent accuracy for detecting cardiac amyloidosis with C-statistics of 0.85-0.92 and 0.91-1.00 for the ECG and echocardiography models, respectively, with the latter outperforming expert diagnosis. Simulating deployment on 13,906 and 7775 patients with ECG-echocardiography paired data for AMC2 and AMC3 indicated a positive predictive value (PPV) for the ECG model of 4% and 3% at 61% and 54% recall, respectively. Pre-screening with ECG enhanced the echocardiography model performance from PPV 23% and 20% to PPV 58% and 53% at 64% recall, respectively for AMC2 and AMC3. In conclusion, we have developed a robust pipeline to augment detection of cardiac amyloidosis, which should serve as a generalizable strategy for other rare and intermediate frequency cardiac diseases with established or emerging therapies.","",""

We performed a systematic literature search in PubMed and Medline up to May 2020 to identify relevant articles. Our results showed that the development of machine‐learning based applications is rapidly evolving in the management of pancreatic diseases, guiding precision medicine in clinical, endoscopic and radiologic settings. Before implementation into clinical practice, further research should focus on the external validation of novel techniques, clarifying the accuracy and robustness of these models.","",""

Successful explanation involves both cognitive and social processes. In this paper we focus on the challenge of meaningful interaction between an explainer and an explainee and investigate the structural aspects of an explanation in order to propose a human explanation dialog model. We follow a bottom-up approach to derive the model by analysing transcripts of 398 different explanation dialog types. We use grounded theory to code and identify key components of which an explanation dialog consists. We carry out further analysis to identify the relationships between components and sequences and cycles that occur in a dialog. We present a generalized state model obtained by the analysis and compare it with an existing conceptual dialog model of explanation.","",""

Although the conclusions from these studies are available, the same is not true of the data. Accordingly, it is a complex problem to build a training set and develop machine-learning models from these studies. Classic machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques cannot provide a full scientific understanding of the inner workings of the underlying models. This raises credibility issues due to the lack of transparency and generalizability. Explainable artificial intelligence is an emerging approach for promoting credibility, accountability, and trust in mission-critical areas such as medicine by combining machine-learning approaches with explanatory techniques that explicitly show what the decision criteria are and why (or how) they have been established. Hence, thinking about how machine learning could benefit from knowledge graphs that combine “common sense” knowledge as well as semantic reasoning and causality models is a potential solution to this problem. Objective In this study, we aimed to leverage explainable artificial intelligence, and propose a proof-of-concept prototype for a knowledge-driven evidence-based recommendation system to improve mental health surveillance. Methods We used concepts from an ontology that we have developed to build and train a question-answering agent using the Google DialogFlow engine. In addition to the question-answering agent, the initial prototype includes knowledge graph generation and recommendation components that leverage third-party graph technology. Results To showcase the framework functionalities, we here present a prototype design and demonstrate the main features through four use case scenarios motivated by an initiative currently implemented at a children’s hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. Ongoing development of the prototype requires implementing an optimization algorithm of the recommendations, incorporating a privacy layer through a personal health library, and conducting a clinical trial to assess both usability and usefulness of the implementation. Conclusions This semantic-driven explainable artificial intelligence prototype can enhance health care practitioners’ ability to provide explanations for the decisions they make.","",""
