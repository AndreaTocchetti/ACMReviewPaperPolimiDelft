This paper focuses on the design of a robust chattering free mathematical model-base artificial intelligence (fuzzy inference system) variable structure controller (MFVSC) for highly nonlinear dynamic continuum robot manipulator, in presence of uncertainties. In order to provide high performance nonlinear methodology, variable structure controller is selected. Pure variable structure controller can be used to control of partly known nonlinear dynamic parameters of continuum robot manipulator. In order to reduce/eliminate the chattering, this research is used the artificial intelligence (fuzzy logic) theory. The results demonstrate that the model base fuzzy variable structure controller with switching function is a model-based controllers which works well in certain and partly uncertain system. Lyapunov stability is proved in mathematical modelbased fuzzy variable structure controller with switching (sign) function. This controller has acceptable performance in presence of uncertainty (e.g., overshoot=1%, rise time=0.9 second, steady state error = 1.6e-8 and RMS error=4.8e-8).","",""

One extensively used method to minimize the cost and time for the drug development process is computer-aided drug design (CADD). CADD allows better focusing on experiments, which can reduce the time and cost involved in researching new drugs. In this context, structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) is robust and useful and is one of the most promising in silico techniques for drug design. SBVS attempts to predict the best interaction mode between two molecules to form a stable complex, and it uses scoring functions to estimate the force of non-covalent interactions between a ligand and molecular target. Thus, scoring functions are the main reason for the success or failure of SBVS software. Many software programs are used to perform SBVS, and since they use different algorithms, it is possible to obtain different results from different software using the same input. In the last decade, a new technique of SBVS called consensus virtual screening (CVS) has been used in some studies to increase the accuracy of SBVS and to reduce the false positives obtained in these experiments. An indispensable condition to be able to utilize SBVS is the availability of a 3D structure of the target protein. Some virtual databases, such as the Protein Data Bank, have been created to store the 3D structures of molecules. However, sometimes it is not possible to experimentally obtain the 3D structure. In this situation, the homology modeling methodology allows the prediction of the 3D structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence. This review presents an overview of the challenges involved in the use of CADD to perform SBVS, the areas where CADD tools support SBVS, a comparison between the most commonly used tools, and the techniques currently used in an attempt to reduce the time and cost in the drug development process.

The similar creation of robust and accurate AI models for ADME/Tox endpoint and activity prediction would be revolutionary to drug discovery pipelines. There have been numerous demonstrations of successful applications, but a key challenge remains: how generalizable are these predictive models? Areas covered The authors present a summary of current promising components of AI models in the context of early drug discovery where ADME/Tox endpoint and activity prediction is the main driver of the iterative drug design process. Following that is a review of applicability domains and dataset construction considerations which determine generalizability bottlenecks for AI deployment. Further reviewed is the role of promising learning frameworks – multitask, transfer, and meta learning – which leverage auxiliary data to overcome issues of generalizability. Expert opinion The authors conclude that the most promising direction toward integrating reliable and informative AI models into the drug discovery pipeline is a conjunction of learned feature representations, deep learning, and novel learning frameworks. Such a solution would address the sparse and incomplete datasets that are available for key endpoints related to drug discovery.","",""

Yet the inherent limitations of triboelectric sensors such as high susceptibility to humidity and long-term stability remain a great challenge to develop a reliable floor monitoring system. Here we develop a robust and smart floor monitoring system through the synergistic integration of highly reliable triboelectric coding mats and deep-learning-assisted data analytics. Two quaternary coding electrodes are configured, and their outputs are normalized with respect to a reference electrode, leading to highly stable detection that is not affected by the ambient parameters and operation manners. Besides, due to the universal electrode pattern design, all the floor mats can be screen-printed with only one mask, rendering higher facileness and cost-effectiveness. Then a distinctive coding can be implemented to each floor mat through external wiring, which permits the parallel-array connection to minimize the output terminals and system complexity. Further integrating with deep-learning-assisted data analytics, a smart floor monitoring system is realized for various smart home monitoring and interactions, including position/trajectory tracking, identity recognition, and automatic controls. Hence, the developed low-cost, large-area, reliable, and smart floor monitoring system shows a promising advancement of floor sensing technology in smart home applications.","",""

First, a clear and effective data governance framework is critical. Legal standards need to be enacted and insurers should be encouraged and given incentives to adopt a human-centred approach in the design and use of big data analytics and artificial intelligence. Second, a clear and accountable process is necessary to explain what information can be used and how it can be used.

Also, different stability notions are applied for differently behaving models. In addition, uncertainties are ubiquitous in neural network systems, and may result in performance degradation, hazards or system damage. Driven by practical needs and theoretical challenges, the rigorous handling of uncertainties in the neural network design stage is an essential research topic. In this research, the concept of robust practical stability is introduced for generalized discrete neural network models under uncertainties applied in engineering design. A robust practical stability analysis is offered using the Lyapunov function method. Since practical stability concept is more appropriate for engineering applications, the obtained results can be of a practical significance to numerous engineering design problems of diverse interest.","",""

Current high landfill cost and severe environmental impact of waste reveals the need to reduce waste generated from construction activities. Although literature reveals that the best approach to Construction Waste (CW) management is minimization at the design stage, current tools are not robust enough to support architects and design engineers. Review of extant literature reveals that the key limitations of existing CW management tools are that they are not integrated with the design process and that they lack Building Information Modelling (BIM) compliance. This is because the tools are external to design BIM tools used by architects and design engineers. This study therefore investigates BIM-based strategies for CW management and develops Artificial Intelligent (AI) hybrid models to predict CW at the design stage. The model was then integrated into Autodesk Revit as an add-in (BIMWaste) to provide CW analytics.    Based on a critical realism paradigm, the study adopts exploratory sequential mixed methods, which combines both qualitative and quantitative methods into a single study. The study starts with the review of extant literature and (FGIs) with industry practitioners. The transcripts of the FGIs were subjected to thematic analysis to identify prevalent themes from the quotations. The factors from literature review and FGIs were then combined and put together in a questionnaire survey and distributed to industry practitioners. The questionnaire responses were subjected to rigorous statistical process to identify key strategies for BIM-based approach to waste efficient design coordination.    Results of factor analysis revealed five groups of BIM strategies for CW management, which are: (i) improved collaboration for waste management, (ii) waste-driven design process and solutions, (iii) lifecycle waste analytics, (iv) Innovative technologies for waste intelligence and analytics, and (v) improved documentation for waste management. The results improve the understanding of BIM functionalities and how they could improve the effectiveness of existing CW management tools. Thereafter, the key strategies were developed into a holistic BIM framework for CW management. This was done to incorporate industrial and technological requirements for BIM enabled waste management into an integrated system.    The framework guided the development of AI hybrid models and BIM based tool for CW management. Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) model was developed for CW prediction and mathematical models were developed for CW minimisation. Based on historical Construction Waste Record (CWR) from 117 building projects, the model development reveals that two key predictors of CW are “GFA” and “Construction Type”. The final models were then incorporated into Autodesk Revit to enable the prediction of CW from building designs. The performance of the final tool was tested using a test plan and two test cases. The results show that the tool performs well and that it predicts CW according to waste types, element types, and building levels. The study generated several implications that would be of interest to several stakeholders in the construction industry.

Matlab-Simulink model is used to tune each parameter of Proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller by selecting appropriate fuzzy rules through simulations. Mamdani-type of Fuzzy Logic Controller is employed in this paper due to its simple and robust approach.

However, the current systems rely heavily on a strong assumption: all clients have a wealth of ground truth labeled data, which may not be always feasible in the real life. In this paper, we present a practical Robust, and Communication-efficient Semi-supervised FL (RC-SSFL) system design that can enable the clients to jointly learn a high-quality model that is comparable to typical FL's performance. In this setting, we assume that the client has only unlabeled data and the server has a limited amount of labeled data. Besides, we consider malicious clients can launch poisoning attacks to harm the performance of the global model. To solve this issue, RC-SSFL employs a minimax optimization-based client selection strategy to select the clients who hold high-quality updates and uses geometric median aggregation to robustly aggregate model updates. Furthermore, RC-SSFL implements a novel symmetric quantization method to greatly improve communication efficiency. Extensive case studies on two real-world datasets demonstrate that RC-SSFL can maintain the performance comparable to typical FL in the presence of poisoning attacks and reduce communication overhead by $2 \times \sim 4 \times $.","",""

However, the number of required measurements may vary from system to system depending on several factors. Furthermore, it is important to ensure that these estimators are robust to input noise. Moreover, a factor to be considered in presence of sparse electrical measurements is that other additional inputs may be used to improve the accuracy of estimation. This paper investigates the decisive factors that affect the minimum number of input measurements for an ANN-based estimator. Furthermore, it discusses how the ANN should be designed to handle measurement noise properly in practice. Simulations are performed on benchmark networks to support the discussion.","",""

Based on the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry technology, the IRA can extract three-dimensional ground coordinates with at least two antennas. However, some IRA uncertainties caused by geometric factors and IRA-inherent measurement errors have proven to be difficult to eliminate by signal processing. These uncertainties contaminate IRA outputs, crucially impacting the navigation performance of low-grade IRA sensors in particular. To deal with such uncertainties, an ant-mutated immune particle filter (AMIPF) is proposed. The proposed filter combines the ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm with the immune auxiliary particle filter (IAPF) to bring individual mutation intensity. The immune system indicates the stochastic parameters of the ACO, which conducts the mutation process in one step for the purpose of computational efficiency. The ant mutation then moves particles into the most desirable position using parameters from the immune system to obtain optimal particle diversity. To verify the performance of the proposed filter, a terrain referenced navigation (TRN) simulation was conducted on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The Monte Carlo simulation results show that the proposed filter is not only more computationally efficient than the IAPF but also outperforms both the IAPF and the auxiliary particle filter (APF) in navigation performance and robustness.","",""

It is crucial to build these algorithms in a structured manner to ensure reproducibility and reliability. In this context, we used a dataset of breast ultrasound (US) images with 252 breast cancer and 253 benign cases to refine the CAD image analysis workflow. Various dataset preparations (i.e., pre-processing, and spatial augmentation) and machine learning algorithms were tested to establish the framework with the best performance in the detection and classification of breast lesions in US images. The efficacy of the proposed workflows was evaluated regarding accuracy, precision, specificity, and sensitivity. Abstract Automation of medical data analysis is an important topic in modern cancer diagnostics, aiming at robust and reproducible workflows. Therefore, we used a dataset of breast US images (252 malignant and 253 benign cases) to realize and compare different strategies for CAD support in lesion detection and classification. Eight different datasets (including pre-processed and spatially augmented images) were prepared, and machine learning algorithms (i.e., Viola–Jones; YOLOv3) were trained for lesion detection. The radiomics signature (RS) was derived from detection boxes and compared with RS derived from manually obtained segments. Finally, the classification model was established and evaluated concerning accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve. After training on a dataset including logarithmic derivatives of US images, we found that YOLOv3 obtains better results in breast lesion detection (IoU: 0.544 ± 0.081; LE: 0.171 ± 0.009) than the Viola–Jones framework (IoU: 0.399 ± 0.054; LE: 0.096 ± 0.016). Interestingly, our findings show that the classification model trained with RS derived from detection boxes and the model based on the RS derived from a gold standard manual segmentation are comparable (p-value = 0.071). Thus, deriving radiomics signatures from the detection box is a promising technique for building a breast lesion classification model, and may reduce the need for the lesion segmentation step in the future design of CAD systems.","",""

Robotic systems controlling is vital due to the wide range of application. Obviously stability and robustness are the most minimum requirements in control systems; even though the proof of stability and robustness is more important especially in the case of nonlinear systems. The strategies of robotic manipulators control are classified into two main groups: classical and non-classical methods, where the conventional control theory uses the classical method and the artificial intelligence theory (e.g., fuzzy logic, neural network, and neuro fuzzy) uses the non-classical methods. However both of classical and non-classical theories have applied successfully in many applications, but they also have some limitations.

We call this vulnerable model as adversarial artificial intelligence (AI). In this paper, we target to design a robust Trojan detection scheme that inspects whether a pre-trained AI model has been Trojaned before its deployment. Prior works are oblivious of the intrinsic property of trigger distribution and try to reconstruct the trigger pattern using simple heuristics, i.e., stimulating the given model to incorrect outputs. As a result, their detection time and effectiveness are limited. We leverage the observation that the pixel trigger typically features spatial dependency and propose TAD, the first trigger approximation based Trojan detection framework that enables fast and scalable search of the trigger in the input space. Furthermore, TAD can also detect Trojans embedded in the feature space where certain filter transformations are used to activate the Trojan.

In reaction to that, numerous optimization algorithms have been proposed. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a new paradigm of Swarm Intelligence which is inspired by concepts from 'Social Psychology' and 'Artificial Life'. Essentially, PSO proposes that the co-operation of individuals promotes the evolution of the swarm. In terms of optimization, the hope would be to enhance the swarm's ability to search on a global scale so as to determine the global optimum in a fitness landscape. It has been empirically shown to perform well with regard to many different kinds of optimization problems. PSO is particularly a preferable candidate to solve highly nonlinear, non-convex and even discontinuous problems. The main ambition of this thesis is to propose two enhanced versions of PSO (Modified Guaranteed Convergence PSO (MGCPSO) and Modified Lbest based PSO (LPSO)) and to extend them to different areas of application.  MGCPSO is an extension of the Gbest based version of PSO and exhibits balanced performance between accuracy and efficiency in empirical numerical tests. It is applied to robust design with metamodel as well as structural sizing optimization in this work. In order to improve the efficiency of computing with regard to robust design, a mixed Fortran-Matlab program is developed as well as its corresponding parallel pattern. It obtains satisfying results for both optimization problems.  On the other hand, LPSO constitutes an enhanced Lbest based version of PSO whereby two LPSOs with two and three neighbour links are tested by means of the empirical benchmark test. Both demonstrate excellent global searching ability. For this reason, this algorithm is extended to problems of truss topological design. This type of optimization problems can be characterised as large-scale and non-convex. LPSO is very well suited to this particular field of optimization. Indeed, it achieves solutions that challenge the best ones ever found. Finally, MGCPSO is successfully applied to a structural sizing optimization problem.","",""

In particular, we define a novel generic framework for AI-based blackbox deobfuscation encompassing prior work and highlighting key components; we are the first to point out that the search space underlying code deobfuscation is too unstable for simulation-basedmethods (e.g., Monte Carlo Tres Search used in prior work) and advocate the use of robust methods such as S-metaheuritics; we propose the new optimized AI-based blackbox deobfuscator Xyntia which significantly outperforms prior work in terms of success rate (especially with small time budget) while being completely immune to the most recent anti-analysis code obfuscation methods; and finally we propose two novel protections against AI-based blackbox deobfuscation, allowing to counter Xyntia’s powerful attacks.","",""

However, music is a kind of time-series data, and it is challenging to design an effective music genre classification (MGC) system due to a large quantity of music data. Robust MGC techniques necessitate a massive amount of data, which is time-consuming, laborious, and requires expert knowledge. Few studies have focused on the design of music representations extracted directly from input waveforms. In recent times, deep learning (DL) models have been widely used due to their characteristics of automatic extracting advanced features and contextual representation from actual music or processed data. This paper aims to develop a novel deep learning-enabled music genre classification (DLE-MGC) technique. The proposed DLE-MGC technique effectively classifies the music genres into multiple classes by using three subprocesses, namely preprocessing, classification, and hyperparameter optimization. At the initial stage, the Pitch to Vector (Pitch2vec) approach is applied as a preprocessing step where the pitches in the input musical instrument digital interface (MIDI) files are transformed into the vector sequences. Besides, the DLE-MGC technique involves the design of a cat swarm optimization (CSO) with bidirectional long-term memory (BiLSTM) model for the classification process. The DBTMPE technique has gained a moderately increased accuracy of 94.27%, and the DLE-MGC technique has accomplished a better accuracy of 95.87%. The performance validation of the DLE-MGC technique was carried out using the Lakh MIDI music dataset, and the comparative results verified the promising performance of the DLE-MGC technique over current methods.","",""

In the proposed robotic system, the front and rear part are connected via an actuated spinal structure with six degrees of freedom. To increase the robustness of the system's locomotion in terms of traction and stability, a footlike structure equipped with various sensors has been developed.

For example, the distribution of predictions is usually biased and dependents on the sensitive attributes (e.g., gender and ethnicity). Numerous approaches have therefore been proposed to develop decision-making systems that are discrimination-conscious by-design, which are typically batch-based and require the simultaneous availability of all the training data for model learning. However, in the real-world, the data streams usually come on the fly which requires the model to process each input data once ""on arrival"" and without the need for storage and reprocessing. In addition, the data streams might also evolve over time, which further requires the model to be able to simultaneously adapt to non-stationary data distributions and time-evolving bias patterns, with an effective and robust trade-off between accuracy and fairness. In this paper, we propose a novel framework of online decision tree with fairness in the data stream with possible distribution drifting. Specifically, first, we propose two novel fairness splitting criteria that encode the data as well as possible, while simultaneously removing dependence on the sensitive attributes, and further adapts to non-stationary distribution with fine-grained control when needed.

This paper investigates a region-based approach that performs pixel clustering prior to the processes of attention in contrast to late clustering as done by contemporary methods. The foundation steps of feature map construction for the region-based attention model are proposed here. The color contrast map is generated based upon the extended findings from the color theory, the symmetry map is constructed using a novel scanning-based method, and a new algorithm is proposed to compute a size contrast map as a formal feature channel. Eccentricity and orientation are computed using the moments of obtained regions and then saliency is evaluated using the rarity criteria. The efficient design of the proposed algorithms allows incorporating five feature channels while maintaining a processing rate of multiple frames per second. Another salient advantage over the existing techniques is the reusability of the salient regions in the high-level machine vision procedures due to preservation of their shapes and precise locations. The results indicate that the proposed model has the potential to efficiently integrate the phenomenon of attention into the main stream of machine vision and systems with restricted computing resources such as mobile robots can benefit from its advantages.","",""

The advantage of this controller is that it can handle the nonlinearities faster than other conventional controllers. The approach of the proposed controller is to minimize the vibrations on each corner of vehicle by supplying control forces to suspension system when travelling on rough road. The other purpose for using the NF controller for vehicle model is to reduce the body inclinations that are made during intensive manoeuvres including braking and cornering.

The design and implementation of CAPTCHA lie in the domain of artificial intelligence. We aim to design a CAPTCHA, which will effectively use by modern digitize world and turn to reduce the optical recognition and other automated attacks. In this paper, for better security issues, a non OCR CAPTCHA design called digital CAPTCHA based on Mathematical Boolean algebra by use digital logic gates. The different logic gates design which depict shapes like (AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR). Each gate executes multiple answers based on Boolean algebra by use Boolean laws. For prove human, user recognize shapes of logic gates and choose a correct answer from multiple answers. The experimental results analyze by multiple technical and non technical users with different age groups. The resulting values show that our proposed system has high probability and security and resists the visual attacks with existing math CAPTCHAs.","",""

In this paper, we will try to build upon the reasons why the human brain is so effective in learning tasks as complex as the one of driving, borrowing explanations from the most established theories on sensorimotor learning in the field of cognitive neuroscience. The contribution of this work would like to be a new point of view on how the known capabilities of the brain can be taken as an inspiration for the implementation of a more robust artificial driving agent. In this direction, we consider the Convergencedivergence Zones (CDZs) as the most prominent proposal in explaining the simulation process underlying the human sensorimotor learning. We propose to use the CDZs as a “template” for the implementation of neural network models mimicking the phenomenon of mental imagery, which is considered to be at the heart of the human ability to perform sophisticated sensorimotor controls such driving.","",""

In this paper, we incorporate temporal pattern descriptors of joint positions with the currently popular long short‐term memory (LSTM)–based learning scheme to obtain accurate and robust action recognition. Considering that actions are essentially formed by small subactions, we first utilize a two‐dimensional wavelet transform to extract temporal pattern descriptors in the frequency domain for each subaction. Afterward, we design a novel LSTM structure to extract deep features, which model a long‐term spatiotemporal correlation between body parts. Since temporal pattern descriptors and LSTM deep features can be regarded as multimodal representations for actions, we fuse them with an autoencoder network to achieve a more effective feature descriptor for action recognition. Experimental results on three challenging data sets with several comparative methods demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for three‐dimensional action recognition.","",""

While current state-of-the-art UAVs are equipped with collision avoidance features, there is less attention to the automatic and real-time fault detection of power lines using UAVs. This paper presents the architecture of three drone-oriented concept designs for automatic and real-time fault detection of power lines using UAVs. The proposed systems could be potential candidates for replacing traditional inspection methods of power lines, which are risky and costly. By incorporating a robust neural network, i.e., Artificial Intelligence (AI), and using appropriate and efficient sensors, the systems can automatically detect various faults and defects on power lines with high precision. We propose three concept design options comprised of different hardware/software components and their feasibility factors. For instance, FLIR Duo Pro R as a thermal sensor and Zenmuse XT for thermal vision have been proposed to be used in the concept designs. For data communication, the proposed designs use cloud-based virtual private network (VPN) for a secure connection between remote control (RC) of the UAV and the server. Based on the advantages and disadvantages of the three proposed design options, the most efficient design is also discussed. This design proposes a system with lightweight sensors, which could increase the flight time of the UAV. Further, the AI interface is coded on to the RC, making it economical, without any database for big data storage. The back-end of the neural network is stored in a cloud server. With the help of GSM antenna, the AI can run on the tablet if there is an available cellular network.","",""

AUCCC is threshold-free, robust to perturbation, and insensitive to the classification performance. We evaluate several UQ methods (e.g., max softmax output) with AUCCC to validate its effectiveness. Furthermore, a simple scheme, named Uncertainty Distillation (UDist), is developed to boost the UQ performance, where a confidence model is distilling the confidence estimated by deep ensembles.

Traditionally, intelligence is manually gathered and extracted by intelligence analysts. However, there will never be enough intelligence analysts, intelligent centers, or even bandwidth (for mobile sensors) to manually extract information for intelligence from raw sensor data. Fusing a large number of sensor types and inputs is also required. All of this can be implemented and automated in an artificial intelligent (AI) hierarchy described herein, and therefore not require human power to observe, fuse, and interpret. This objective is fulfilled in this systems dissertation with several independent systems combined together to form an intelligent system of systems (SoS).  In order to design and implement an intelligent SoS, there are a number of unique contributions from this author in this dissertation. The first six listed author contributions are systems developments as Chief Engineer on the intelligent SoS and the last six contributions are novel technological developments. The following are the SoS systems developments: (1) a Fixed Camera System containing a multi-camera network (thirty-six PoE cameras) and six processing units; (2) a Kiosk System containing dual Pan/Tilt/Zoom cameras, a microphone network and two processing units; and (3) a Command and Control System containing a database on a server with dual monitors displaying an (4) interactive executive graphical user interface displaying (5) mustered personnel and (6) abnormal behavior alarms.

The robust and novel methods of continuous ant colony optimization (ACOR ) and artificial bee colony (ABC), both inspired from collective behavior of ant and bee swarms, are here employed to guarantee finding near-optimal solutions in a continuous nonlinear constrained optimization schedule. Results obtained from several independent runs clearly demonstrate fast convergence with nearly identical results for both methods, conservatively claimed as global optima.

Precise and robust classifiers are not only judged by classification accuracy but also by sensitivity (correctly classified legitimate emails) and specificity (correctly classified unsolicited emails) towards the accurate classification, captured by both false positive and false negative rates. This paper aims to present a comparative study between various decision tree classifiers (such as AD tree, decision stump and REP tree) with/without different boosting algorithms (bagging, boosting with re-sample and AdaBoost).   Design/methodology/approach Artificial intelligence and text mining approaches have been incorporated in this study. Each decision tree classifier in this study is tested on informative words/features selected from the two publically available data sets (SpamAssassin and LingSpam) using a greedy step-wise feature search method.   Findings Outcomes of this study show that without boosting, the REP tree provides high performance accuracy with the AD tree ranking as the second-best performer. Decision stump is found to be the under-performing classifier of this study. However, with boosting, the combination of REP tree and AdaBoost compares favourably with other classification models. If the metrics false positive rate and performance accuracy are taken together, AD tree and REP tree with AdaBoost were both found to carry out an effective classification task. Greedy stepwise has proven its worth in this study by selecting a subset of valuable features to identify the correct class of emails.   Research limitations/implications This research is focussed on the classification of those email spams that are written in the English language only. The proposed models work with content (words/features) of email data that is mostly found in the body of the mail. Image spam has not been included in this study. Other messages such as short message service or multi-media messaging service were not included in this study.   Practical implications In this research, a boosted decision tree approach has been proposed and used to classify email spam and ham files; this is found to be a highly effective approach in comparison with other state-of-the-art modes used in other studies. This classifier may be tested for different applications and may provide new insights for developers and researchers.   Originality/value A comparison of decision tree classifiers with/without ensemble has been presented for spam classification. ","",""
