Towards minimizing discrimination against a group, fair machine learning algorithms strive to equalize the behavior of a model across different groups, by imposing a fairness constraint on models. However, we show that giving the same importance to groups of different sizes and distributions, to counteract the effect of bias in training data, can be in conflict with robustness. We analyze data poisoning attacks against group-based fair machine learning, with the focus on equalized odds. An adversary who can control sampling or labeling for a fraction of training data, can reduce the test accuracy significantly beyond what he can achieve on unconstrained models. Adversarial sampling and adversarial labeling attacks can also worsen the model's fairness gap on test data, even though the model satisfies the fairness constraint on training data. We analyze the robustness of fair machine learning through an empirical evaluation of attacks on multiple algorithms and benchmark datasets.","",""

However, noise and decoherence are two major obstacles to the practical implementation of quantum machine learning. In this work, we introduce a general framework for the robustness analysis of quantum machine learning algorithms against noise and decoherence. We argue that fidelity is the only pick of measuring the robustness. A robust bound is derived and an algorithm is developed to check whether or not a quantum machine learning algorithm is robust with respect to the training data. In particular, this algorithm can help to defense attacks and improve the accuracy as it can identify useful new training data during checking. The effectiveness of our robust bound and algorithm is confirmed by the case study of quantum phase recognition. Furthermore, this experiment demonstrates a trade-off between the accuracy of quantum machine learning algorithms and their robustness.","",""

Among the standard models for COVID-19 global pandemic prediction, simple epidemiological and statistical models have received more attention by authorities, and they are popular in the media. Due to a high level of uncertainty and lack of essential data, standard models have shown low accuracy for long-term prediction. Although the literature includes several attempts to address this issue, the essential generalization and robustness abilities of existing models needs to be improved. This paper presents a comparative analysis of machine learning and soft computing models to predict the COVID-19 outbreak. Among a wide range of machine learning models investigated, two models showed promising results (i.e., multi-layered perceptron, MLP, and adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system, ANFIS). Based on the results reported here, and due to the highly complex nature of the COVID-19 outbreak and variation in its behavior from nation-to-nation, this study suggests machine learning as an effective tool to model the outbreak.","",""

However, only a few comparative studies that may help investigate this robustness have been reported. An important contribution, going beyond previous studies, is that we perform the analyses by employing the most well-known and broadly implemented packages of the three classifiers and control their settings to represent users’ actual applications. This facilitates an understanding of the extent to which the noise types and levels in remotely sensed data impact classification accuracy using ML classifiers. By using those implementations, we classified the land cover data from a satellite image that was separately afflicted by seven-level zero-mean Gaussian, salt–pepper, and speckle noise. The modeling data and features were strictly controlled. Finally, we discussed how each noise type affects the accuracy obtained from each classifier and the robustness of the classifiers to noise in the data.

Specifically, it can achieve very good accuracy in areas of the features' space that have been sufficiently explored during the training process. Conversely, AM techniques require no or minimal training, hence exhibiting the potential for supporting prompt instantiation of the performance model of the target system. However, in order to ensure their tractability, they typically rely on a set of simplifying assumptions.

Traditional EEW methods based on seismometers fail to accurately identify large earthquakes due to their sensitivity to the ground motion velocity. The recently introduced high-precision GPS stations, on the other hand, are ineffective to identify medium earthquakes due to its propensity to produce noisy data. In addition, GPS stations and seismometers may be deployed in large numbers across different locations and may produce a significant volume of data consequently, affecting the response time and the robustness of EEW systems.In practice, EEW can be seen as a typical classification problem in the machine learning field: multi-sensor data are given in input, and earthquake severity is the classification result.

DMSEEW is based on a new stacking ensemble method which has been evaluated on a real-world dataset validated with geoscientists. The system builds on a geographically distributed infrastructure, ensuring an efficient computation in terms of response time and robustness to partial infrastructure failures.

To overcome this trade-off, we introduce Patch Gaussian, a simple augmentation scheme that adds noise to randomly selected patches in an input image. Models trained with Patch Gaussian achieve state of the art on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNetCommon Corruptions benchmarks while also improving accuracy on clean data.

Guided by this intuition, we demonstrate that discretization greatly improves the robustness of the DLNs against adversarial attacks. Specifically, discretizing the input space (or allowed pixel levels from 256 values or 8<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$bit$ </tex-math></inline-formula> to 4 values or 2<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$bit$ </tex-math></inline-formula>) extensively improves the adversarial robustness of the DLNs for a substantial range of perturbations for minimal loss in test accuracy.

Combining input discretization with the BNNs furthers the robustness, even waiving the need for adversarial training for the certain magnitude of perturbation values.

In this paper, we introduce the notion of the boundary thickness of a classifier, and we describe its connection with and usefulness for model robustness. Thick decision boundaries lead to improved performance, while thin decision boundaries lead to overfitting (e.g., measured by the robust generalization gap between training and testing) and lower robustness. We show that a thicker boundary helps improve robustness against adversarial examples (e.g., improving the robust test accuracy of adversarial training) as well as so-called out-of-distribution (OOD) transforms, and we show that many commonly-used regularization and data augmentation procedures can increase boundary thickness. On the theoretical side, we establish that maximizing boundary thickness during training is akin to the so-called mixup training. Using these observations, we show that noise-augmentation on mixup training further increases boundary thickness, thereby combating vulnerability to various forms of adversarial attacks and OOD transforms. We can also show that the performance improvement in several lines of recent work happens in conjunction with a thicker boundary.","",""

This can be attributed to the fact that existing methods often rely on several simplifying a priori assumptions of the underlying physical tissue properties or cannot deal with realistic noise levels.

Therefore, we propose to reduce the systematic error of the ROI samples by additionally discarding those pixels for which our method estimates a high error and thus a low confidence. In silico experiments show an improvement in the accuracy of optical absorption quantification when applying our method to refine the ROI, and it might thus become a valuable tool for increasing the robustness of qPAI methods.","",""

However, they are able to learn non-robust classifiers with very high accuracy, even in the presence of random perturbations. Towards explaining this gap, we highlight the hypothesis that $\textit{robust classification may require more complex classifiers (i.e. more capacity) than standard classification.}$  In this note, we show that this hypothesis is indeed possible, by giving several theoretical examples of classification tasks and sets of ""simple"" classifiers for which: (1) There exists a simple classifier with high standard accuracy, and also high accuracy under random $\ell_\infty$ noise. (2) Any simple classifier is not robust: it must have high adversarial loss with $\ell_\infty$ perturbations. (3) Robust classification is possible, but only with more complex classifiers (exponentially more complex, in some examples).  Moreover, $\textit{there is a quantitative trade-off between robustness and standard accuracy among simple classifiers.}$ This suggests an alternate explanation of this phenomenon, which appears in practice: the tradeoff may occur not because the classification task inherently requires such a tradeoff (as in [Tsipras-Santurkar-Engstrom-Turner-Madry `18]), but because the structure of our current classifiers imposes such a tradeoff.","",""

Recent work on inducing deep grammars from treebanks addresses this shortcoming by also  recovering non-local dependencies and grammatical relations. My aim is to investigate the issues arising when adapting an existing Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG) induction method to a new language and treebank, and find solutions which will generalize robustly across multiple languages.  The research hypothesis is that by exploiting machine-learning algorithms to learn morphological features, lemmatization classes and grammatical functions from treebanks we can reduce the amount of manual specification and improve robustness, accuracy and domain- and language -independence for LFG parsing systems. Function labels can often be relatively straightforwardly mapped to LFG grammatical functions. Learning them reliably permits grammar induction to depend less on language-specific LFG annotation rules. I therefore propose ways to improve acquisition of function labels from treebanks and translate those improvements into better-quality f-structure parsing.  In a lexicalized grammatical formalism such as LFG a large amount of syntactically relevant information comes from lexical entries. It is, therefore, important to be able  to perform morphological analysis in an accurate and robust way for morphologically rich languages.

While modern search engines provide methods to visually search for a query image that contains a flower, it lacks in robustness because of the intra-class variation among millions of flower species around the world. Hence in this proposed research work, a Deep learning approach using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is used to recognize flower species with high accuracy.

Support vector machine (SVM) classifiers are widely applied to hyperspectral image (HSI) classification and provide significant advantages in terms of accuracy, simplicity, and robustness. SVM is a well-known learning algorithm that maximizes the minimum margin. However, recent theoretical results pointed out that maximizing the minimum margin leads to a lower generalization performance than optimizing the margin distribution, and proved that the margin distribution is more important. In this paper, a large margin distribution machine (LDM) is applied to HSI classification, and optimizing the margin distribution achieves a better generalization performance than SVM. Since the raw HSI feature space is not the most effective space for representing HSI, we adopt factor analysis to learn an effective HSI feature and the learned features are further filtered by a structure-preserved filter to fully exploit the spatial structure information of HSI. The spatial structure information is integrated in the feature learning process to obtain a better HSI feature. Then we propose a multiclass LDM to classify the filtered HSI feature. Experimental results show that the proposed LDM with feature learning method achieves the classification performance of the state-of-the-art methods in terms of visual quality and three quantitative evaluations and indicates that LDM has a high generalization performance.","",""

By doing so, we implicitly introduce a smoothness or robustness regularization against the random perturbations, and hence improve the generation performance. For example, in the case of Gaussian perturbation,  \emph{MaxUp} is asymptotically equivalent to using the gradient norm of the loss as a penalty to encourage smoothness. We test \emph{MaxUp} on a range of tasks, including image classification, language modeling, and adversarial certification, on which \emph{MaxUp} consistently outperforms the existing best baseline methods, without introducing substantial computational overhead.

The proposed models for river flow include support vector regression (SVR), a hybrid of SVR with a fruit fly optimization algorithm (FOA) (so-called FOASVR), and an M5 model tree (M5). Additionally, the influence of periodicity (π) on the forecasting enactment was examined.

With the increasing number of Systems Vaccinology datasets being generated, we expect that the accuracy and robustness of signatures of vaccine reactogenicity and immunogenicity will significantly improve.","",""

As a result, many machine learning techniques are still limited to being used in situations where safety and robustness are not critical for success. One way to overcome this difficulty is by using reachability analysis, which can be used to compute regions of the state space, known as reachable sets, from which the system can be guaranteed to remain safe over some time horizon regardless of the disturbances. In this paper we show how reachability analysis can be combined with machine learning in a scenario in which an aerial robot is attempting to learn the dynamics of a ground vehicle using a camera with a limited field of view. The resulting simulation data shows that by combining these two paradigms, one can create robotic systems that feature the best qualities of each, namely high performance and guaranteed safety.","",""

Unfortunately, these models are also very brittle and vulnerable to specially crafted adversarial examples. Recent results have shown that accuracy of these models can be reduced from close to hundred percent to below 5% using adversarial examples. This brittleness of deep neural networks makes it challenging to deploy these learning models in security-critical areas where adversarial activity is expected, and cannot be ignored. A number of methods have been recently proposed to craft more effective and generalizable attacks on neural networks along with competing efforts to improve robustness of these learning models. But the current approaches to make machine learning techniques more resilient fall short of their goal. Further, the succession of new adversarial attacks against proposed methods to increase neural network robustness raises doubts about a foolproof approach to robustify machine learning models against all possible adversarial attacks. In this paper, we consider the problem of detecting adversarial examples. This would help identify when the learning models cannot be trusted without attempting to repair the models or make them robust to adversarial attacks. This goal of finding limitations of the learning model presents a more tractable approach to protecting against adversarial attacks. Our approach is based on identifying a low dimensional manifold in which the training samples lie, and then using the distance of a new observation from this manifold to identify whether this data point is adversarial or not. Our empirical study demonstrates that adversarial examples not only lie farther away from the data manifold, but this distance from manifold of the adversarial examples increases with the attack confidence. Thus, adversarial examples that are likely to result into incorrect prediction by the machine learning model is also easier to detect by our approach. This is a first step towards formulating a novel approach based on computational geometry that can identify the limiting boundaries of a machine learning model, and detect adversarial attacks.","",""

This article investigates the robustness and accuracy of seven popular techniques for tolerating incomplete training and test data for different patterns of missing data—different proportions and mechanisms of missing data on resulting tree-based models. The seven missing data techniques were compared by artificially simulating different proportions, patterns, and mechanisms of missing data using 21 complete datasets (i.e., with no missing values) obtained from the University of California, Irvine repository of machine-learning databases (Blake and Merz, 1998). A four-way repeated measures design was employed to analyze the data. The simulation results suggest important differences. All methods have their strengths and weaknesses. However, listwise deletion is substantially inferior to the other six techniques, while multiple imputation, that utilizes the expectation maximization algorithm, represents a superior approach to handling incomplete data. Decision tree single imputation and surrogate variables splitting are more severely impacted by missing values distributed among all attributes compared to when they are only on a single attribute. Otherwise, the imputation—versus model-based imputation procedures gave—reasonably good results although some discrepancies remained. Different techniques for addressing missing values when using decision trees can give substantially diverse results, and must be carefully considered to protect against biases and spurious findings. Multiple imputation should always be used, especially if the data contain many missing values. If few values are missing, any of the missing data techniques might be considered. The choice of technique should be guided by the proportion, pattern, and mechanisms of missing data, especially the latter two. However, the use of older techniques like listwise deletion and mean or mode single imputation is no longer justifiable given the accessibility and ease of use of more advanced techniques, such as multiple imputation and supervised learning imputation.","",""

The first shows that machine-learning-based recognition of temporal ex- pressions not only achieves high accuracy on its own but can also improve rule-based normalization. The second makes use of a staged normaliza- tion architecture to experiment with machine learned classifiers for cer- tain disambiguation sub-tasks within the normalization task.","",""

Based on fiducial detection for robustness, we show how a machine-learning approach allows the development of significantly more reliable fiducial detection than has previously been demonstrated. We calibrate fiducial positions using a structure-from-motion solver. We then show how nonlinear optimization of the camera position during tracking gives accuracy comparable with full bundle adjustment but at significantly reduced cost.","",""

The performance of a thermal error compensation system basically depends on the accuracy and robustness of the thermal error model. This paper presents a thermal error model using two mathematic schemes: GM(1, N) model of the grey system theory and the adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). First, the measured temperature and deformation results were analyzed via the GM(1, N) model to obtain the influence ranking of temperature ascent on thermal drift of spindle. Then, using the high-ranking temperature ascents as the input of ANFIS and training these data by hybrid learning rule, the thermal compensation model can be quickly built. The GM(1, N) model is used to effectively reduce the number of temperature sensors putting on the machine structure in prediction, and the ANFIS has the advantages of good accuracy and robustness. Eventually, tests of no-load and real-cutting operations were conducted and the comparison results show that the modeling schemes of ANFIS coupled with the GM(1, N) has good prediction ability","",""

Right setting parameters are very crucial to learning results and generalization ability of SVM. In this paper, parameters selection is regarded as a compound optimization problem and a modified differential evolution (MDE) algorithm is applied to search the optimal parameters. The modified differential evolution adopts a time-varying crossover probability strategy, which can improve the global convergence ability and robustness of the algorithm. Various examples are simulated and the experiment results demonstrate that this proposed approach has better approximation performance than other approaches.","",""
