However, most of them are model-based controllers where it is imperative to have an accurate knowledge of the vehicle hydrodynamic parameters. Despite some sliding mode and neural network-based controllers are reported as model-free, just a few of them consider a solution with finite-time convergence, which brings strong robustness and fast convergence compared with asymptotic or exponential solutions and it can also help to reduce the power consumption of the vehicle thrusters. This work aims to implement a model-free high-order sliding-mode controller and synthesize it with a time-base generator to achieve finite-time convergence. The time-base was included by parametrizing the control gain at the sliding surface. Numerical simulations validated the finite-time convergence of the controller for different time-bases even in the presence of high ocean currents. The performance of the obtained solution was also evaluated by the Root Mean Square (RMS) value of the control coefficients computed for the thrusters, as a parameter to measure the power consumption of the vehicle when following a trajectory. Computational results showed a reduction of up to 50% in the power consumption from the thrusters when compared with other solutions.","",""

To enhance learning ability of neural network models, the autoencoder method is used as a powerful tool to achieve deep learning and has gained success in recent years. However, the performance of existing autoencoder approaches for manipulator control may be still largely dependent on the quality of data, and for extreme cases with noisy data it may even fail. How to incorporate the model knowledge into the autoencoder controller design with an aim to increase the robustness and reliability remains a challenging problem. In this work, a sparse autoencoder controller for kinematic control of manipulators with weights obtained directly from the robot model rather than training data is proposed for the first time. By encoding and decoding the control target though a new dynamic recurrent neural network architecture, the control input can be solved through a new sparse optimization formulation. In this work, input saturation, which holds for almost all practical systems but usually is ignored for analysis simplicity, is also considered in the controller construction. Theoretical analysis and extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed sparse autoencoder controller with input saturation can make the end-effector of the manipulator system track the desired path efficiently. Further performance comparison and evaluation against the additive noise and parameter uncertainty substantiate robustness of the proposed sparse autoencoder manipulator controller.","",""

The generalizability and robustness properties of our method have been analytically inspected in experiments and discussions, and the computational cost is comparable to training a standard neural network-based collaborative filtering model.

A layer named the frame gate is designed to integrate weighted semantic information on multiple frames to remove redundant and meaningless signal frames. A triple-net structure is introduced to distill the learned features net by net to replace the hand-engineered features with professional knowledge. Specifically, one neural network is normally trained for several epochs.

Medical image segmentation uses several imaging modalities (MRI, Computed Tomography (CT), Positron Emission Tomography (PET), X-RAY, Ultrasound). However, it is a challenge yet, due to added noise, artifacts, limitations, and unclear edges [8]. In this way, colon tissues segmentation in human abdominal CT images is the base of analysis and identification of cancer nidus, providing powerful information in a CAD, such as early polyps detection, which can reduce the incidence of colon cancer [3],[6],[14]. Colon segmentation techniques can also be used in colorectal tissues simulations to make preoperative plans and simulations of surgery [4]. Some colon segmentation algorithms are introduced in literature, each one having its own model, computational complexity, and overall quality. Such as Local region based active contours [6], which is based on local statistics of tissue of interest and background, instead of global statistics. In [15], an isotropic volume reconstructed from the CT images is used to extract a thick region encompassing the entire colon, where mean curvature, dimensionless ratio sphericity and minimum polyp size are used as parameters to filter anomalies and reduce false positives. Classifications of multispectral colorectal cancer tissues [5], classify tissues samples using convolutional neural network (CNN) and uses active contours technique to extract colorectal regions corresponding to pathological tissues. Although some works presented in literature have demonstrated how CNN provides effective results to analyze colon images, those works are based on the segmentation image regions containing pathological colorectal tissues [5],[7], and glandular colon structure [10]. On the contrary, the analysis of colon tissues as pre-processing task for applications, as tissues simulations, is our motivation to challenge the use of pixel-wise segmentation with CNN. In order to overcome the problem of misclassifying colon tissue pixels, in this paper, we propose a method for automatic colon tissues segmentation based on spatial features learned with CNN. The proposed method has been compared to three state-of-the-art methods. Preliminary experimental results demonstrate the proposed method achieves a higher robustness in terms of sensitivity and similarity, and reduces the number of misclassified colon tissue pixels.","",""

A training dataset is constructed based on the patches centered on the labeled pixels. Second, a DBN is trained on the resulting database to predict the probability of each pixel to belong to be a vein pixel given a patch centered on it. The vein patterns are segmented using a probability threshold of 0.5. The resulting vein features are employed to reconstruct the training dataset, based on which the network is retrained. During the iterative procedure, the incorrect labels of training data are statistically corrected, which enables DBN to effectively learn what a finger-vein pattern is by learning the difference between vein patterns and background ones. The experimental results on two public hand-vein databases show a significant improvement in terms of hand-vein verification accuracy.","",""

The estimation of defect size in specimen from the MFL measurements is a key and difficult problem. The traditional methods have low precision because feature extraction procedure relies on prior knowledge and the ability of designer. Inspired by the idea of convolutional neural network (CNN), a novel visual transformation CNN (VT-CNN) is proposed in this paper to overcome the limitation of traditional method in a feature extraction procedure. By adding a visual transformation layer according to the characteristics of the MFL measurements, the VT-CNN can distinguish the defect feature with different sizes more accurately. Moreover, since the VT-CNN method is designed based on the deep learning theory, more industrial big data with accurate label should be used to train the network. Due to the difficulty of making real industrial big data, a novel mesher magnetic dipole model is designed to simulate this industrial process. A large simulated MFL measurement of irregular defects produced by this model can increase the number of training samples and improve the robustness of the network. Experiments to estimate natural corrosion defects on real industrial pipelines are performed to validate the proposed framework. The experimental results are illustrated in detail, which highlights the superiority of the proposed method in industrial applications.","",""

Spatial and spectral information are obtained simultaneously by hyperspectral remote sensing. Joint extraction of these information of hyperspectral image is one of most import methods for hyperspectral image classification.

The proposed model not only learns sufficient knowledge from the limited number of samples, but also has powerful generalization ability. The proposed framework based on three-dimensional convolution can extract spectral-spatial features of labeled samples effectively. Though CNN has shown its robustness to distortion, it cannot extract features of different scales through the traditional pooling layer that only have one size of pooling window. Hence, spatial pyramid pooling (SPP) is introduced into three-dimensional local convolutional filters for hyperspectral classification.

The DermoExpert consists of a preprocessing, a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (hybrid-CNN), and transfer learning. The proposed hybrid-CNN classifier consists of three distinct feature extractors, with the same input images, which are fused to achieve better-depth feature maps of the corresponding lesion. Those distinct and fused feature maps are classified using the different fully connected layers, which are then ensembled to get a final prediction probability. In the preprocessing, we use lesion segmentation, augmentation, and class rebalancing. For boosting the lesion recognition, we have also employed geometric and intensity-based augmentation as well as the class rebalancing by penalizing the loss of the majority class and adding extra images to the minority classes. Additionally, we leverage the knowledge from a pre-trained model, also known as transfer learning, to build a generic classifier, although small datasets are being used.

These architectures enable faster inferences and could bring DNNs to low-power devices, e.g. in the Internet of Things (IoT). However, it is unknown if the computational savings provided by this approach are robust against adversarial pressure. In particular, an adversary may aim to slow down adaptive DNNs by increasing their average inference time$-$a threat analogous to the $denial$-$of$-$service$ attacks from the Internet. In this paper, we conduct a systematic evaluation of this threat by experimenting with three generic multi-exit DNNs (based on VGG16, MobileNet, and ResNet56) and a custom multi-exit architecture, on two popular image classification benchmarks (CIFAR-10 and Tiny ImageNet). To this end, we show that adversarial sample-crafting techniques can be modified to cause slowdown, and we propose a metric for comparing their impact on different architectures. We show that a slowdown attack reduces the efficacy of multi-exit DNNs by 90%-100%, and it amplifies the latency by 1.5-5$\times$ in a typical IoT deployment. We also show that it is possible to craft universal, reusable perturbations and that the attack can be effective in realistic black-box scenarios, where the attacker has limited knowledge about the victim. Finally, we show that adversarial training provides limited protection against slowdowns.

The automatic method is able to detect the damaged building by extracting the defect features. However, various design methods and widely changing real-world conditions, such as shadow and light changes, cause challenges to the extensive appointing of automatic methods. As a potential solution for such challenges, this research proposes the adaption of deep learning (DL), specifically convolutional neural networks (CNN), which has a high ability to learn features automatically, to identify damaged buildings from pre- and post-event RS imageries. Since RS data revolves around imagery, CNNs can arguably be most effective at automatically discovering relevant features, avoiding the need for feature engineering based on expert knowledge. In this work, we focus on RS imageries from orthophoto imageries for damaged-building detection, specifically for (i) background, (ii) no damage, (iii) minor damage, and (iv) debris classifications.

To tackle this challenging task, we developed a dual-branch dilated residual 3D fully convolutional network with parallel convolutions to extract more global context and alleviate the class imbalance issue by maintaining a small receptive field that is just the size of the regions of interest (ROIs). We also conduct multi-scale feature fusion in both parallel and series to compensate the potential information loss during convolutions, which has been shown to be important for small objects. The serial feature fusion enabled by residual connections is further enhanced by a proposed top-down attention-guided refinement unit, where the high-resolution low-level spatial details are selectively integrated to complement the high-level but coarse semantic information, enriching the final feature representations. As a result, the segmentations resulting from our method are more accurate both volumetrically and morphologically, compared with other deep learning based approaches.

In many applications, feed-forward neural networks are heavily involved in the implementation of controllers by learning and representing control laws through several methods such as model predictive control (MPC) and reinforcement learning (RL). The type of networks that we consider in this manuscript are feed-forward neural networks consisting of multiple hidden layers with ReLU activation functions and a linear activation function in the output layer. While neural network controllers have been able to achieve desirable performance in many contexts, they also present a unique challenge in that it is difficult to provide any guarantees about the correctness of their behavior or reason about the stability a system that employs their use. Thus, from a controls perspective, it is necessary to verify them in conjunction with their corresponding plants in closed-loop. While there have been a handful of works proposed towards the verification of closed-loop systems with feed-forward neural network controllers, this area still lacks attention and a unified set of benchmark examples on which verification techniques can be evaluated and compared. Thus, to this end, we present a range of closed-loop control systems ranging from two to six state variables, and a range of controllers with sizes in the range of eleven neurons to a few hundred neurons in more complex systems.

In recent years, advances in Artficial Intelligence (AI) have enabled a diverse range of technologies that are directly impacting people’s everyday lives [16]. Particularly, within this space, machine learning methods such as Deep Learning (DL) have achieved levels of accuracy and performance that are competitive or better than humans for tasks such as pattern and image recognition [12], natural language processing [7], and knowledge representation and reasoning [15,22]. Despite these achievements, there have been reservations about incorporating them into safety critical systems [11] due to their susceptibility to unexpected and errant behavior from a slight perturbation in their inputs [18]. Furthermore, neural networks are often viewed as ""black boxes"" since the underlying operation of the neuron activations is often indiscernible [22]. In light of these challenges, there has been significant work towards the creation of methods and verification tools that can formally reason about the behavior of neural networks [22]. However, the vast majority of these techniques have only been able to deal with feed-forward neural networks with piecewise-linear activation functions [4]. Additionally, the bulk of these methods have primarily considered the verification of input-output properties of neural networks in isolation [22], and there are only a handful of works that have explicitly addressed the verification of closed-loop control systems with neural network controllers [5, 8, 19–21]. One of the central challenges in verifying neural network control systems is that applying existing methodology to these systems is not straightforward [9], and a simple combination of verification tools for non-linear ordinary differential equations along with a neural network reachability tool suffers from severe overestimation errors [5]. Still, the verification of closed loop neural network systems is deeply important as they naturally arise in safety critical systems [5] such as autonomous vehicles, and complex control systems that make use of model predictive control and reinforcement learning [16]. Thus, there is a compelling need for methods and advanced software tools that can effectively deal with the complexities exhibited by these systems [5]. Inspired by a shortage of verification methods for closed-loop neural network control systems in the research literature, the central contribution of this paper is the provision of a set of executable benchmarks that have been synthesized using methods such as reinforcement learning [17], and model predictive control [14]. The problems elucidated in the paper are modeled using Simulink/Stateflow (SLSF) and are available at the following github repository1. We aim to provide a thorough problem description to which the numerous tools and approaches for non-linear systems and neural network verification present in the research community can be evaluated and compared [22]. If the research community is able to devise acceptable solutions to the aformentioned challenges they will stimulate the development of robust and intelligent systems with the potential to bring unparalleled benefits to numerous application domains. 2 Description of benchmarks. In this manuscript, we present a set of linear and non-linear closed-loop systems with continuoustime plants and feedforward neural networks controllers trained using different controls schemes such as reinforcement learning or model predictive control (MPC).

Instead of establishing the photon transmission models and solving the inverse problem, the proposed method directly fits the nonlinear relationship between fluorescence intensity at the boundary and fluorescent source in biological tissue. For details, DGMM consists of three stages: In the first stage, the measured optical intensity was encoded into a feature vector by transferring the VGG16 model; In the second stage, we fused all encoded feature vectors into one feature vector by using GRU based network; In the last stage, the fused feature vector was used to reconstruct the fluorescent sources by MLP model.

In contrast to other tuning techniques such as Ziegler– Nichols or genetic algorithms (GA), our proposal allows a real-time adjustment of the tuning parameters according to the network conditions. Thus, the new algorithm provides an online control of the tuning process unlike the ZN and GA techniques, whose tuning parameters are calculated offline. The algorithm, called neural network service level PID (NNSPID), guarantees minimum bandwidth levels to users depending on their service level agreement, and it is compared with a tuning technique based on genetic algorithms (GASPID). The simulation study demonstrates that NN-SPID continuously adapts the tuning parameters, achieving lower fluctuations than GA-SPID in the allocation process. As a consequence, it provides a more stable response than GA-SPID since it needs to launch the GA to obtain new tuning values. Furthermore, NN-SPID guarantees the minimum bandwidth levels faster than GA-SPID. Finally, NN-SPID is more robust than GA-SPID under real-time changes of the guaranteed bandwidth levels, as GA-SPID shows high fluctuations in the allocated bandwidth, especially just after any change is made.","",""

Taking into account the sporadic nature of IoT devices, we formulate the joint activity detection and channel estimation (JADCE) problem as a group-sparse matrix estimation problem. This problem can be solved by applying the existing compressed sensing techniques, which however either suffer from high computational complexities or lack of algorithm robustness. To this end, we propose a novel algorithm unrolling framework based on the deep neural network to simultaneously achieve low computational complexity and high robustness for solving the JADCE problem. Specifically, we map the original iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm (ISTA) into an unrolled recurrent neural network (RNN), thereby improving the convergence rate and computational efficiency through end-to-end training. Moreover, the proposed algorithm unrolling approach inherits the structure and domain knowledge of the ISTA, thereby maintaining the algorithm robustness, which can handle non-Gaussian preamble sequence matrix in massive access. With rigorous theoretical analysis, we further simplify the unrolled network structure by reducing the redundant training parameters. Furthermore, we prove that the simplified unrolled deep neural network structures enjoy a linear convergence rate. Extensive simulations based on various preamble signatures show that the proposed unrolled networks outperform the existing methods in terms of the convergence rate, robustness and estimation accuracy.","",""

However, these prerequisites are not always realistic due to storage costs or privacy issues in real-world applications. Here we propose the concept of decision-based black-box (DB3) knowledge distillation, with which the student is trained by distilling the knowledge from a black-box teacher (parameters are not accessible) that only returns classes rather than softmax outputs.

We represent a sample's robustness against other classes by computing its distances to the teacher's decision boundaries and use it to construct the soft label for each training sample. After that, the student can be trained via standard KD. We then extend this approach to a more challenging scenario in which even accessing the training data is not feasible. We propose to generate pseudo samples distinguished by the teacher's decision boundaries to the largest extent and construct soft labels for them, which are used as the transfer set.

At each phase of model development, data reflecting the evolution dynamics of turbulence and domain knowledge representing prior physical considerations are converted into modeling knowledge. The data- and knowledge-driven UIML is investigated with a deep residual network. The following three aspects are demonstrated in detail: (i) a compact input feature parameterizing a new turbulent timescale is introduced to prevent nonunique mappings between conventional input arguments and output Reynolds stress; (ii) a realizability limiter is developed to overcome the under-constrained state of modeled stress; and (iii) fairness and noise-insensitivity constraints are included in the training procedure. Consequently, an invariant, realizable, unbiased, and robust data-driven turbulence model is achieved. The influences of the training dataset size, activation function, and network hyperparameter on the performance are also investigated. The resulting model exhibits good generalization across two- and three-dimensional flows, and captures the effects of the Reynolds number and aspect ratio.

Because there is no open data set of weld beads and the samples in real industrial applications are insufficient for effective model training of the deep convolutional neural network, a novel data augmentation method based on a deep semantic segmentation network is proposed to increase the sample diversity and enlarge the data set. Then, a dynamic sample updating strategy is put forward to cover more welding situations. Finally, faced with the weak-feature and weak-texture characteristics of weld beads, a simplified YOLOV3 model is proposed to realize end-to-end weld bead location. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method could effectively satisfy the robustness and precision requirements for weld bead detection and location combined with a deep semantic segmentation network and simplified YOLOV3 model.","",""

This dissertation presents several classes of composite neural networks which are trained to provide appealing solutions to the problem of knowledge acquisition. The value of the network parameters, after sufficient training, are then utilized to generate production rules on the basis of preselected meaningful coordinates. Neural networks are attracting a lot of interest in the scientific community because of their dynamical nature: robustness, capability of generalization and fault tolerance. Neural networks have already proven useful in low level information processing (e.g. signal analysis). However, an apparent disadvantage of traditional neural networks (i.e. backpropagation networks) is that they do not provide explanations of their response i.e. explicit rules or logical reasoning processes. The classes of composite neural networks studied in this dissertation integrate the paradigm of neural networks with the rule-based approach, rendering them more useful than either. It is shown that the composite neural networks act as Bayesian classifiers, and more importantly, can provide density estimates of the class variables. The dissertation provides a mathematical framework for achieving reasonable generalization properties of composite neural networks serving as universal approximators via an appropriate training algorithm (supervised decision-directed learning). The algorithm is based on an approach that divides the input (feature) space into proper subsets (e.g. hyperspheres, hyperrectangles, or hyperellipsoids), represented as portions of the trained composite neural networks, while the complete structures provide acceptable knowledge representations of the data.  The new concepts and methods presented in the dissertation are illustrated via two traditional academic pattern recognition examples and one practical example from medical diagnosis. These examples are discussed in detail. Finally the dissertation concludes with a summary of the most important results accomplished and with brief recommendation for future work.","",""

While the prediction accuracy of deep learning models is high, these models' robustness has raised many safety concerns, given that imperceptible perturbations added to input can substantially degrade the model performance. In this work, we propose an adversarial attack framework by treating the prediction model as a black-box, i.e., assuming no knowledge of the model architecture, training data, and (hyper) parameters. However, we assume that the adversary can oracle the prediction model with any input and obtain corresponding output. Next, the adversary can train a substitute model using input-output pairs and generate adversarial signals based on the substitute model. To test the attack effectiveness, two state of the art, graph neural network-based models (GCGRNN [1] and DCRNN [2]) are examined. As a result, the adversary can degrade the target model's prediction accuracy up to 54 %. In comparison, two conventional statistical models (linear regression and historical average) are also examined.

Those methods have their own pros and cons at specific aspects. For example, regression analysis is not suitable for complex, high dimensional and non-linear system; Fuzzy logic relies more on mathematical model; Kalman filtering works only for Gaussian noise process; The performance of Bayesian network in high dimensional data set is poor. None of them except ANN are suitable for modeling the ship motion, as situations in which lack precise mathematical model and only input-output sample data are available. Indeed, an ANN is a “black box” and has the ability to explicitly identify possible causal relationships from the inputoutput sample data. However, there is no standard to construct a compact ANN for prediction purposes. Input parameters and hidden units are the main factors to obtain an optimized model [7]. If there are too few inputs, the network cannot represent the input-output mapping of system with sufficient accuracy. If there are too many inputs, the network dimension will increase, which in turn aggravates computational complexity. Both cases will deteriorate the generalization capability of the network. Therefore, selection of input parameters is a key issue when applying ANN 1 Copyright c © 2017 by ASME to ship motion prediction. SA investigates how the variation in the output of a numerical model can be attributed to variations of its input factors, and it plays an important role in prediction model construction and simplification, and thus the generalization ability of prediction model. The main purpose of SA is to estimate the contribution of each model input, either main or interaction contribution, on the model output and to identify the main contributors to the output. SA has been widely used in areas such as engineering, economics, and sociology [8]. Taking advantages of SA’s characteristics, it is possible to use it to select the input parameters of an ANN based model used for ship motion prediction. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The related work section is a brief recall of some of the existing methods in ANN and SA. In the next section, we describe the input selection procedure and the case ship, then the methods we used in this paper is introduced and the calculation of local sensitivity analysis (LSA) and global sensitivity analysis (GSA) are explained. After that, the proposed algorithm is tested using two analytical models and a case study of SA on heading of ship motion prediction model is described in detail. The results are shown and the calculated first order sensitivity index are compared with analytical results. A comparison of the performance of the LSA and GSA is also presented in this section. Finally conclusions are given. RELATED WORK Artificial Neural Network Inspired by biological neural network, ANN could build up the mathematical relationship between the input parameters and the output parameters, with the advantage that it can be modeled without prior knowledge. An ANN facilitates the ability to learn complex nonlinear relationships between input and output parameters. Thanks to the powerful potential (massive parallelism, generalization capacity and fault-tolerance), ANN has been widely used in fields like pattern recognition, reliability analysis, classification, ship motion control and prediction. The basic architecture of ANN consists of single input, hidden and output layer, with each layer containing one or more neurons, in addition to bias neurons connected to the hidden and output layers. The back-propagation (BP) algorithm is the most widely used learning algorithm for ANN, which is a self-adapted learning procedure that minimizes the error between the desired and the predicted outputs. The learning process consists of two parts: feed-forward and backward pass. The output of ANN is calculated in the process of feed-forward pass, with the output error propagated backward to adjust the weights and bias of the ANN. The number of hidden layer nodes and the maximum iteration number should be carefully chosen to overcome the over-fitting and under-fitting problems. Over-fitting means that a trained ANN has weak capability of generalization. An over-fitted ANN usually has a good prediction capability over train samples, but has a bad prediction capability over test samples. Under-fitting means that a trained ANN is too simple to be capable of representing the relationship between input parameters and output targets. An under-fitted ANN usually has bad prediction capabilities over both training and testing samples. Sensitivity Analysis SA could be implemented in either local or global manner. The LSA explore the response of the model output to a small change of the parameter from its nominal value. Garson algorithm is one of the popular LSA algorithms [9]. This method has shown to be computational efficient and conceptually simple when quantifying the relative importance of input parameters. It has been used in some ship motion prediction applications, such as the work in [5, 6, 10]. Local sensitivity index is calculated at the nominal point or a fixed point, which is not representative for all inputs in the whole parameter space. In addition, the LSA do not explore the interactions between input parameters. In contrast, a GSA estimates the effect of input parameters across the whole input parameter space. GSA is generally divided into four categories: Traditional methods, Analysis of Variance methods (ANOVA) methods, Derivative-Based Methods and Surrogate-Based Methods. ANOVA methods are also called variance-based methods, which makes ANOVA decomposition of model response variances into the contributions from individual parameters and their interactions. Cukier, et al. presented Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test (FAST) [11]. Later, Salteli et al. introduces a global, quantitative, model independent SA method for calculating both main effect and total effect indices based on the FAST — extended FAST (EFAST) [12]. EFAST is model independent, which can be used in ANN based prediction. Currently, most of the study only focuses on studying either LSA or GSA in ANN based ship prediction model. There is not a systematic comparison between them. In this study, efforts are made to combine the ANN with the Garson algorithm and the EFAST algorithm respectively, aiming to find out which one is preferable for nonlinear ship motion prediction. SIMPLIFICATION OF ANN MODEL VIA SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS System Structure This paper aims to construct a compact ANN model for ship motion prediction using the SA approach. The main idea is to use the SA method to evaluate the importance of each input and select the inputs according to their importance. The input selection procedure consists of four components: data cleaning, surrogate model, SA and result visualization. Data cleaning is to minimize the affection of noisy, redundant information of sensor data on further analysis and modeling. In general, it is difficult to estimate the contribution of each input parameter and the interaction 2 Copyright c © 2017 by ASME","",""

Spectral CT is especially suited for imaging with K-edge contrast agents to address the otherwise limited contrast in soft tissues. We have developed a micro-CT system based on a PCXD. This system enables both 4 energy bins acquisition, as well as full-spectrum mode in which the energy thresholds of the PCXD are swept to sample the full energy spectrum for each detector element and projection angle. Measurements provided by the PCXD, however, are distorted due to undesirable physical effects in the detector and can be very noisy due to photon starvation in narrow energy bins. To address spectral distortions, we propose and demonstrate a novel artificial neural network (ANN)-based spectral distortion correction mechanism, which learns to undo the distortion in spectral CT, resulting in improved material decomposition accuracy. To address noise, post-reconstruction denoising based on bilateral filtration, which jointly enforces intensity gradient sparsity between spectral samples, is used to further improve the robustness of ANN training and material decomposition accuracy. Our ANN-based distortion correction method is calibrated using 3D-printed phantoms and a model of our spectral CT system. To enable realistic simulations and validation of our method, we first modeled the spectral distortions using experimental data acquired from (109)Cd and (133)Ba radioactive sources measured with our PCXD. Next, we trained an ANN to learn the relationship between the distorted spectral CT projections and the ideal, distortion-free projections in a calibration step. This required knowledge of the ground truth, distortion-free spectral CT projections, which were obtained by simulating a spectral CT scan of the digital version of a 3D-printed phantom. Once the training was completed, the trained ANN was used to perform distortion correction on any subsequent scans of the same system with the same parameters. We used joint bilateral filtration to perform noise reduction by jointly enforcing intensity gradient sparsity between the reconstructed images for each energy bin. Following reconstruction and denoising, the CT data was spectrally decomposed using the photoelectric effect, Compton scattering, and a K-edge material (i.e. iodine). The ANN-based distortion correction approach was tested using both simulations and experimental data acquired in phantoms and a mouse with our PCXD-based micro-CT system for 4 bins and full-spectrum acquisition modes. The iodine detectability and decomposition accuracy were assessed using the contrast-to-noise ratio and relative error in iodine concentration estimation metrics in images with and without distortion correction. In simulation, the material decomposition accuracy in the reconstructed data was vastly improved following distortion correction and denoising, with 50% and 20% reductions in material concentration measurement error in full-spectrum and 4 energy bins cases, respectively. Overall, experimental data confirms that full-spectrum mode provides superior results to 4-energy mode when the distortion corrections are applied. The material decomposition accuracy in the reconstructed data was vastly improved following distortion correction and denoising, with as much as a 41% reduction in material concentration measurement error for full-spectrum mode, while also bringing the iodine detectability to 4-6 mg ml(-1). Distortion correction also improved the 4 bins mode data, but to a lesser extent. The results demonstrate the experimental feasibility and potential advantages of ANN-based distortion correction and joint bilateral filtration-based denoising for accurate K-edge imaging with a PCXD. Given the computational efficiency with which the ANN can be applied to projection data, the proposed scheme can be readily integrated into existing CT reconstruction pipelines.","",""

Deep neural networks (DNNs) constantly showed state-of-the-art performance over the last few years in visual machine perception, e.g., semantic segmentation. While DNNs work fine on uncorrupted data, recently introduced adversarial examples (AEs) led to misclassification with high confidence. This lack of robustness against such adversarial attacks questions the use of DNNs in safety-critical autonomous systems, e.g., autonomous driving vehicles. In this work, we address the mentioned problem with the use of a redundant teacher-student framework, consisting of a static teacher network (T), a static student network (S), and a constantly adapting student network (A). By using this triplet in combination with a novel inverse feature matching (IFM) loss, we show that a significant robustness increase of student DNNs against adversarial attacks is achieveable, while maintaining semantic segmentation quality at a reasonably high level. With our approach, we manage to increase the mean intersection over union (mean IoU) ratio between static student adversarial examples and clean images from about 35 % to about 80 % on the Cityscapes dataset.

First, a neural network based fault estimation is designed to online approximate the unknown uncertainties and faults.

Prior efforts mostly focus on incorporating side information to achieve better recommendation performance. However, these methods have some weaknesses: (1) prediction of neural network-based embedding methods are hard to explain and debug; (2) symbolic, graph-based approaches (e.g., meta path-based models) require manual efforts and domain knowledge to define patterns and rules, and ignore the item association types (e.g. substitutable and complementary). In this paper, we propose a novel joint learning framework to integrate induction of explainable rules from knowledge graph with construction of a rule-guided neural recommendation model. The framework encourages two modules to complement each other in generating effective and explainable recommendation: 1) inductive rules, mined from item-centric knowledge graphs, summarize common multi-hop relational patterns for inferring different item associations and provide human-readable explanation for model prediction; 2) recommendation module can be augmented by induced rules and thus have better generalization ability dealing with the cold-start issue. Extensive experiments1 show that our proposed method has achieved significant improvements in item recommendation over baselines on real-world datasets. Our model demonstrates robust performance over “noisy” item knowledge graphs, generated by linking item names to related entities.","",""

A promising alternative is to fine-tune a CNN that has been pre-trained using, for instance, a large set of labeled natural images. However, the substantial differences between natural and medical images may advise against such knowledge transfer. In this paper, we seek to answer the following central question in the context of medical image analysis: Can the use of pre-trained deep CNNs with sufficient fine-tuning eliminate the need for training a deep CNN from scratch? To address this question, we considered four distinct medical imaging applications in three specialties (radiology, cardiology, and gastroenterology) involving classification, detection, and segmentation from three different imaging modalities, and investigated how the performance of deep CNNs trained from scratch compared with the pre-trained CNNs fine-tuned in a layer-wise manner. Our experiments consistently demonstrated that 1) the use of a pre-trained CNN with adequate fine-tuning outperformed or, in the worst case, performed as well as a CNN trained from scratch; 2) fine-tuned CNNs were more robust to the size of training sets than CNNs trained from scratch; 3) neither shallow tuning nor deep tuning was the optimal choice for a particular application; and 4) our layer-wise fine-tuning scheme could offer a practical way to reach the best performance for the application at hand based on the amount of available data.","",""

The local pooling methods are generally formulated in a form of convex combination of local neuron activations for retaining the characteristics of an input feature map in a manner similar to image downscaling. In this paper, to improve performance of CNNs, we propose a novel local pooling method based on the Gaussian-based probabilistic model over local neuron activations for flexibly pooling (extracting) features, in contrast to the previous model restricting the output within the convex hull of local neurons. In the proposed method, the local neuron activations are aggregated into the statistics of mean and standard deviation in a Gaussian distribution, and then on the basis of those statistics, we construct the probabilistic model suitable for the pooling in accordance with the knowledge about local pooling in CNNs. Through the probabilistic model equipped with trainable parameters, the proposed method naturally integrates two schemes of adaptively training the pooling form based on input feature maps and stochastically performing the pooling throughout the end-to-end learning. The experimental results on image classification demonstrate that the proposed method favorably improves performance of various CNNs in comparison with the other pooling methods.","",""

Recycling reduces greenhouse gas emissions, conserves the natural resources on Earth, and saves space in the landfills for future generations of people. A sustainable future requires a high degree of recycling. However, Recycling industries face serious economic problems that increase the cost of recycling. Fuzzy logic has emerged as a tool to deal with uncertain, imprecise, partial truth or qualitative decisionmaking problems, to achieve robustness, tractability, and low cost, but it cannot automatically acquire the rules it uses to make those decisions. Neural networks have the ability to learn, generalize and process large amount of numerical data, but they are not good at explaining how they reach their decisions. The hybrid fuzzy-neural system has the ability to overcome the limitations of individual technique and enhances their strengths to handle financial trading. In order to achieve our objective, a study of a knowledge based system for effective control of profitability in paper recycling is carried out. The Mamdani’s Max-Min technique is employed to infer data from the rules developed. This resulted in the establishment of some degrees of influence of input variables on the output. Fuzzy-Neural network model is developed using back propagation and supervised learning methods respectively. The outputs of Fuzzy logic serve as input to the neural network. To reinforce the proposed approach, we apply it to a case study performed on Paper recycling industry in Nigeria. A computer simulation is designed to assist the experimental decision for the best control action. The system is developed using MySQL, NetBeans, Java, MS Excel 2003, MatLab, etc. The obtained simulation and implementation fuzzy-neural results are investigated, compared and discussed.","",""

In the former, a conventional controller performs a set of trajectories and, based on the input-output dataset, the deep neural network (DNN)-based controller is trained. In the latter, the trained DNN, which mimics the conventional controller, controls the system. Unlike the existing papers in the literature, the network is still being trained for different sets of trajectories which are not used in the training phase of DNN.

In this paper, we are interested in the possibility of defense against adversarial attack on network, and propose defense strategies for GNNs against attacks. First, we propose novel adversarial training strategies to improve GNNs' defensibility against attacks. Then, we analytically investigate the robustness properties for GNNs granted by the use of smooth defense, and propose two special smooth defense strategies: smoothing distillation and smoothing cross-entropy loss function. Both of them are capable of smoothing gradient of GNNs, and consequently reduce the amplitude of adversarial gradients, which benefits gradient masking from attackers.

However, most of the existing work in this area focus on the GNNs for node-level tasks, while little work has been done to study the robustness of the GNNs for the graph classification task. In this paper, we aim to explore the vulnerability of the Hierarchical Graph Pooling (HGP) Neural Networks, which are advanced GNNs that perform very well in the graph classification in terms of prediction accuracy. We propose an adversarial attack framework for this task. Specifically, we design a surrogate model that consists of convolutional and pooling operators to generate adversarial samples to fool the hierarchical GNN-based graph classification models. We set the preserved nodes by the pooling operator as our attack targets, and then we perturb the attack targets slightly to fool the pooling operator in hierarchical GNNs so that they will select the wrong nodes to preserve. We show the adversarial samples generated from multiple datasets by our surrogate model have enough transferability to attack current state-of-art graph classification models. Furthermore, we conduct the robust train on the target models and demonstrate that the retrained graph classification models are able to better defend against the attack from the adversarial samples.
