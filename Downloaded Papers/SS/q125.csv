Notwithstanding the impressive performance of ML/DL, there are still lingering doubts regarding the robustness of ML/DL in healthcare settings (which is traditionally considered quite challenging due to the myriad security and privacy issues involved), especially in light of recent results that have shown that ML/DL are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we present an overview of various application areas in healthcare that leverage such techniques from security and privacy point of view and present associated challenges. In addition, we present potential methods to ensure secure and privacy-preserving ML for healthcare applications. Finally, we provide insight into the current research challenges and promising directions for future research.","",""

Unfortunately, the tools investors currently have available are not robust enough to reduce risk and help them managing uncertainty better. Machine learning data-driven approaches can bridge this gap, as they already do in the hedge fund industry. These approaches are now possible because data from thousands of companies over the world is available through platforms such as Crunchbase. Previous academic efforts have focused only on predicting two classes of exits, i.e., being acquired by other company or offering shares to the public, using only one or a few subsets of explanatory variables. These events are typically related to high returns, but also higher risk, making hard for a venture fund to get repeatable and sustainable returns. On the contrary, we will try to predict more possible outcomes including a subsequent funding round or the closure of the company using a large set of signals. In this way, our approach would provide VC investors with more information to set up a portfolio with lower risk that may eventually achieve higher returns than those based on finding unicorns (i.e., companies with a valuation higher than one billion dollars). We will analyze the performance of several machine learning methods in a dataset of over 120,000 early-stage companies in a realistic setting that tries to predict their progress in a 3-year time window. Results show that machine learning can support venture investors in their decision-making processes to find opportunities and better assessing the risk of potential investments.","",""

We study CDN caching systems, which make a good case for optimization as their performance directly affects operational costs, while currently relying on many hand-tuned parameters. In caching, reinforcement learning has been shown to perform suboptimally when compared to simple heuristics. A key challenge is that rewards (cache hits) manifest with large delays, which prevents timely feedback to the learning algorithm and introduces significant complexity. This paper shows how to significantly simplify this problem by explicitly modeling optimal caching decisions (OPT). While prior work considered deriving OPT impractical, recent theoretical modeling advances change this assumption. Modeling OPT enables even lightweight decision trees to outperform state-of-the-art CDN caching heuristics.","",""

Background: Modern causal inference methods allow machine learning to be used to weaken parametric modeling assumptions. However, the use of machine learning may result in complications for inference. Doubly robust cross-fit estimators have been proposed to yield better statistical properties. Methods: We conducted a simulation study to assess the performance of several different estimators for the average causal effect. The data generating mechanisms for the simulated treatment and outcome included log-transforms, polynomial terms, and discontinuities. We compared singly robust estimators (g-computation, inverse probability weighting) and doubly robust estimators (augmented inverse probability weighting, targeted maximum likelihood estimation). We estimated nuisance functions with parametric models and ensemble machine learning separately. We further assessed doubly robust cross-fit estimators. Results: With correctly specified parametric models, all of the estimators were unbiased and confidence intervals achieved nominal coverage. When used with machine learning, the doubly robust cross-fit estimators substantially outperformed all of the other estimators in terms of bias, variance, and confidence interval coverage. Conclusions: Due to the difficulty of properly specifying parametric models in high-dimensional data, doubly robust estimators with ensemble learning and cross-fitting may be the preferred approach for estimation of the average causal effect in most epidemiologic studies. However, these approaches may require larger sample sizes to avoid finite-sample issues.","",""

To accomplish this goal, a total of 96 high-poverty and 96 non-poverty counties were classified using 15 statistical and spatial features extracted from night-time light imagery in China in 2010 formed a training set for identifying high-poverty counties. Seven machine learning approaches were adopted to classify high-poverty counties, and five feature importance measures were used to select robust features. The resulting metrics, including the user’s (>63%), producer’s (>66%) and overall (>82%) accuracies of the poor county identification (probability of poverty greater than 0.6), show that the seven machine learning approaches used in this paper exhibit good performance, although some differences exist among the approaches. The order of feature importance reveals that the relative importance of each feature differs among the models; however, the important features remain consistent. The nine most important features ranked in each approach are relatively robust for poverty identification at the county level. Both spatial feature and statistical features calculated in part from the central tendency, degree of dispersion, and the distribution of the night-time light data were identified as indispensable robust features in all the approaches, indicating that the complex social phenomenon of poverty requires analysis from different aspects. Previous studies that utilized primarily night-time light imagery applied single features related to the central tendency or the distribution features of the imagery; this study provides a new method and can act as a reference for feature selection and identification of high-poverty counties using night-time light imagery and has potential applications across several scientific domains.","",""

Thus, to solve different machine learning problems, one has to collect coresets of different types, defeating the purpose of saving communication overhead. We resolve this dilemma by developing robust coreset construction algorithms based on k-means/median clustering, that give a provably good approximation for a broad range of machine learning problems with sufficiently continuous cost functions. Through evaluations on diverse datasets and machine learning problems, we verify the robust performance of the proposed algorithms.","",""

We use 100 Monte Carlo samples with sample sizes of 200, 1200, and 5000 to investigate bias and confidence interval coverage under several scenarios. In a simple confounding scenario, confounders were related to the treatment and the outcome via parametric models. In a complex confounding scenario, the simple confounders were transformed to induce complicated nonlinear relationships. In the simple scenario, when ML algorithms were used, double-robust estimators were superior to single-robust estimators. In the complex scenario, single-robust estimators with ML algorithms were at least as biased as estimators using misspecified parametric models. Double-robust estimators were less biased, but coverage was well below nominal. The use of sample splitting, inclusion of confounder interactions, reliance on a richly specified ML algorithm, and use of doubly robust estimators was the only explored approach that yielded negligible bias and nominal coverage. Our results suggest that ML based singly robust methods should be avoided.","",""

We show that S/HIC has unrivaled accuracy for detecting sweeps under demographic histories that are relevant to human populations, and distinguishing sweeps from linked as well as neutrally evolving regions. Moreover we show that S/HIC is uniquely robust among its competitors to model misspecification. Thus even if the true demographic model of a population differs catastrophically from that specified by the user, S/HIC still retains impressive discriminatory power.

We present expert-augmented machine learning, an automated way to automatically extract problem-specific human expert knowledge and integrate it with machine learning to build robust, dependable, and data-efficient predictive models. Machine learning is proving invaluable across disciplines. However, its success is often limited by the quality and quantity of available data, while its adoption is limited by the level of trust afforded by given models. Human vs. machine performance is commonly compared empirically to decide whether a certain task should be performed by a computer or an expert. In reality, the optimal learning strategy may involve combining the complementary strengths of humans and machines. Here, we present expert-augmented machine learning (EAML), an automated method that guides the extraction of expert knowledge and its integration into machine-learned models. We used a large dataset of intensive-care patient data to derive 126 decision rules that predict hospital mortality. Using an online platform, we asked 15 clinicians to assess the relative risk of the subpopulation defined by each rule compared to the total sample. We compared the clinician-assessed risk to the empirical risk and found that, while clinicians agreed with the data in most cases, there were notable exceptions where they overestimated or underestimated the true risk. Studying the rules with greatest disagreement, we identified problems with the training data, including one miscoded variable and one hidden confounder. Filtering the rules based on the extent of disagreement between clinician-assessed risk and empirical risk, we improved performance on out-of-sample data and were able to train with less data. EAML provides a platform for automated creation of problem-specific priors, which help build robust and dependable machine-learning models in critical applications.","",""

The SSL of the Mississippi River, which is one of the major world rivers and is significantly affected by sedimentation, is predicted based on daily values of river discharge (Q) and suspended sediment concentration (SSC). Based on performance metrics and visualization, the RFR model shows a slight lead in prediction performance. The uncertainty analysis also indicates that the input variable combination has more impact on the obtained predictions than the model structure selection.","",""

In each iteration, up to q of the m working machines suffer Byzantine faults -- a faulty machine in the given iteration behaves arbitrarily badly against the system and has complete knowledge of the system. Additionally, the sets of faulty machines may be different across iterations. Our goal is to design robust algorithms such that the system can learn the underlying true parameter, which is of dimension d, despite the interruption of the Byzantine attacks. In this paper, based on the geometric median of means of the gradients, we propose a simple variant of the classical gradient descent method. We show that our method can tolerate q Byzantine failures up to 2(1+ε)q łe m for an arbitrarily small but fixed constant ε>0. The parameter estimate converges in O(łog N) rounds with an estimation error on the order of max √dq/N, ~√d/N , which is larger than the minimax-optimal error rate √d/N in the centralized and failure-free setting by at most a factor of √q . The total computational complexity of our algorithm is of O((Nd/m) log N) at each working machine and O(md + kd log 3 N) at the central server, and the total communication cost is of O(m d log N). We further provide an application of our general results to the linear regression problem. A key challenge arises in the above problem is that Byzantine failures create arbitrary and unspecified dependency among the iterations and the aggregated gradients. To handle this issue in the analysis, we prove that the aggregated gradient, as a function of model parameter, converges uniformly to the true gradient function.","",""

Third, the classifier is adapted online on the basis of user feedback using the Markov decision process. CDKML was applied in fall detection. Tests showed that the classifiers developed by CDKML have better performance than machine‐learning classifiers generated on a training dataset that does not adequately represent all real‐life cases of the learned concept.

To address this problem, it is essential to develop robust fall detection systems. In this context, we develop a machine learning framework for fall detection and daily living activity recognition. We use acceleration and angular velocity data from two public databases to recognize seven different activities, including falls and activities of daily living. From the acceleration and angular velocity data, we extract time- and frequency-domain features and provide them to a classification algorithm. In this paper, we test the performance of four algorithms for classifying human activities. These algorithms are the artificial neural network (ANN),  $K$ -nearest neighbors (KNN), quadratic support vector machine (QSVM), and ensemble bagged tree (EBT). New features that improve the performance of the classifier are extracted from the power spectral density of the acceleration. In the first step, only the acceleration data are used for activity recognition. Our results reveal that the KNN, ANN, QSVM, and EBT algorithms could achieve overall accuracy of 81.2%, 87.8%, 93.2%, and 94.1%, respectively. The accuracy of fall detection reaches 97.2% and 99.1% without any false alarms for the QSVM and EBT algorithms, respectively.

Here, instead, a framework using machine learning together with physically‐derived models is tested, in which it is learnt how to correct the errors of the latter from time step to time step.

Based on whether the feature mapping in extreme learning machine is explicit, we respectively provide random-hidden-nodes and kernelized formulations of RELMs by second order cone programming. Furthermore, the computation of the covariance in feature space is discussed. Simulations and real-world indoor localization experiments are extensively carried out and the results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can not only improve the accuracy and repeatability, but also reduce the deviation and worst case error of IPSs compared with other baseline algorithms.","",""

However, few studies use multi-scale features (as in, a combination of pixel-level and spatial) whilst also offering compelling experimental evidence for real-world performance. Therefore, we introduce CloudFCN, based on a Fully Convolutional Network architecture, known as U-net, which has become a standard Deep Learning approach to image segmentation. It fuses the shallowest and deepest layers of the network, thus routing low-level visible content to its deepest layers.

When machine learning is deployed in the real world, its performance can be significantly degraded because test data may follow a different distribution from training data. DRSL with f-divergences explicitly considers the worst-case distribution shift by minimizing the adversarially reweighted training loss. In this paper, we analyze this DRSL, focusing on the classification scenario. Since the DRSL is explicitly formulated for a distribution shift scenario, we naturally expect it to give a robust classifier that can aggressively handle shifted distributions. However, surprisingly, we prove that the DRSL just ends up giving a classifier that exactly fits the given training distribution, which is too pessimistic. This pessimism comes from two sources: the particular losses used in classification and the fact that the variety of distributions to which the DRSL tries to be robust is too wide. Motivated by our analysis, we propose simple DRSL that overcomes this pessimism and empirically demonstrate its effectiveness.","",""

It is a highly costly task to assign many labels by the oracle for one instance. Meanwhile, it is also hard to build a good model without diagnosing discriminative labels. Can we reduce the label costs and improve the ability to train a good model for multi-label learning simultaneously? Active learning addresses the less training samples problem by querying the most valuable samples to achieve a better performance with little costs. In multi-label active learning, some researches have been done for querying the relevant labels with less training samples or querying all labels without diagnosing the discriminative information. They all cannot effectively handle the outlier labels for the measurement of uncertainty. Since maximum correntropy criterion (MCC) provides a robust analysis for outliers in many machine learning and data mining algorithms, in this paper, we derive a robust multi-label active learning algorithm based on an MCC by merging uncertainty and representativeness, and propose an efficient alternating optimization method to solve it. With MCC, our method can eliminate the influence of outlier labels that are not discriminative to measure the uncertainty. To make further improvement on the ability of information measurement, we merge uncertainty and representativeness with the prediction labels of unknown data. It cannot only enhance the uncertainty but also improve the similarity measurement of multi-label data with labels information.

Then, data instances participate in the classification problem according to their weights.

Particularly concerning are models with inconsistent performance on specific subgroups of a class, e.g., exhibiting disparities in skin cancer classification in the presence or absence of a spurious bandage. To mitigate these performance differences, we introduce model patching, a two-stage framework for improving robustness that encourages the model to be invariant to subgroup differences, and focus on class information shared by subgroups. Model patching first models subgroup features within a class and learns semantic transformations between them, and then trains a classifier with data augmentations that deliberately manipulate subgroup features. We instantiate model patching with CAMEL, which (1) uses a CycleGAN to learn the intra-class, inter-subgroup augmentations, and (2) balances subgroup performance using a theoretically-motivated subgroup consistency regularizer, accompanied by a new robust objective. We demonstrate CAMEL's effectiveness on 3 benchmark datasets, with reductions in robust error of up to 33% relative to the best baseline. Lastly, CAMEL successfully patches a model that fails due to spurious features on a real-world skin cancer dataset.","",""

In the new approach, the image is divided into different regions (tiles). Then, the energy and standard deviation of Hartley transform coefficients of each tile, which serve as the local descriptors of texture, are extracted as sub-features. Next, invariant moments of edge image are used to record the shape features. The shape features and combination of sub-features of texture provide a robust feature set for image retrieval. The most similar highest priority (MSHP) principle is used for matching of textural features and Canberra distance is utilised for shape features matching. The retrieved image is the image which has less MSHP and Canberra distance from the query image. The proposed method is evaluated on three different image sets, which contain about 17 000 images.

Variational quantum circuits are a promising approach for constructing quantum neural networks for machine learning and variational ansatzes for quantum simulation. However, finding the best variational circuit and its optimal parameters is challenging due to the large design space and parameter training cost. We propose to decouple the circuit search from parameter training by introducing a novel SuperCircuit. The SuperCircuit is constructed with multiple layers of pre-defined parameterized gates (e.g., U3 and CU3) and trained by iteratively sampling and updating the parameter subsets (SubCircuits) of it. It provides an accurate estimation of SubCircuits performance trained from scratch. Then we perform an evolutionary co-search of SubCircuit and its qubit mapping. The SubCircuit performance is estimated with parameters inherited from SuperCircuit and simulated with real device noise models. Finally, we perform iterative gate pruning and finetuning to remove redundant gates in a fine-grained manner.Extensively evaluated with 12 quantum machine learning (QML) and variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) benchmarks on 14 quantum computers, QuantumNAS significantly outperforms noise-unaware search, human, random, and existing noise-adaptive qubit mapping baselines.

Traditionally, signal quality assessment is often based on the evaluation of similarity between pulses to derive signal quality indices. There are limitations to using this approach for accurate assessment of PPG quality in the presence of arrhythmia, as in the case of AFib, mainly due to substantial changes in pulse morphology. In this paper, we first tested the performance of algorithms selected from a body of studies on PPG quality assessment using a dataset of PPG recordings from patients with AFib.

It is a critical component in automated text processing. We investigate the performance of machine learning taggers for clinical concept extraction, particularly the portability of taggers across documents from multiple data sources.   METHODS We used BioTagger-GM to train machine learning taggers, which we originally developed for the detection of gene/protein names in the biology domain. Trained taggers were evaluated using the annotated clinical documents made available in the 2010 i2b2/VA Challenge workshop, consisting of documents from four data sources.   RESULTS As expected, performance of a tagger trained on one data source degraded when evaluated on another source, but the degradation of the performance varied depending on data sources. A tagger trained on multiple data sources was robust, and it achieved an F score as high as 0.890 on one data source. The results also suggest that performance of machine learning taggers is likely to improve if more annotated documents are available for training.   CONCLUSION Our study shows how the performance of machine learning taggers is degraded when they are ported across clinical documents from different sources. The portability of taggers can be enhanced by training on datasets from multiple sources.

To the best of our knowledge, there is no benchmark to evaluate these deep learning features. To tackle this problem, in this work we systematically evaluate the performance of deep learning features in view-based 3D model retrieval on four popular datasets (ETH, NTU60, PSB, and MVRED) by different kinds of similarity measure methods. In detail, the performance of hand-crafted features and deep learning features are compared, and then the robustness of deep learning features is assessed. Finally, the difference between single-view deep learning features and multi-view deep learning features is also evaluated. By quantitatively analyzing the performances on different datasets, it is clear that these deep learning features can consistently outperform all of the hand-crafted features, and they are also more robust than the hand-crafted features when different degrees of noise are added into the image. The exploration of latent relationships among different views in multi-view deep learning network architectures shows that the performance of multi-view deep learning outperforms that of single-view deep learning features with low computational complexity.","",""

We compared 3 machine-learning-based embedded feature selection methods in conjunction with 6 feature ensemble techniques for selecting top-ranked features in terms of robustness to data perturbations and predictability for DKD onset.   Results The gradient boosting machine (GBM) with weighted mean rank feature ensemble technique achieved the best performance with an AUC of 0.82 [95%-CI, 0.81-0.83] on internal validation and 0.71 [95%-CI, 0.68-0.73] on external temporal validation.

Recent findings suggest that multiple markers of brain activity extracted from the EEG may index the state of consciousness in the human brain. Furthermore, machine learning has been found to optimize their capacity to discriminate different states of consciousness in clinical practice. However, it is unknown how dependable these EEG markers are in the face of signal variability because of different EEG configurations, EEG protocols and subpopulations from different centres encountered in practice. In this study we analysed 327 recordings of patients with disorders of consciousness (148 unresponsive wakefulness syndrome and 179 minimally conscious state) and 66 healthy controls obtained in two independent research centres (Paris Pitié-Salpêtrière and Liège). We first show that a non-parametric classifier based on ensembles of decision trees provides robust out-of-sample performance on unseen data with a predictive area under the curve (AUC) of ~0.77 that was only marginally affected when using alternative EEG configurations (different numbers and positions of sensors, numbers of epochs, average AUC = 0.750 ± 0.014). In a second step, we observed that classifiers based on multiple as well as single EEG features generalize to recordings obtained from different patient cohorts, EEG protocols and different centres. However, the multivariate model always performed best with a predictive AUC of 0.73 for generalization from Paris 1 to Paris 2 datasets, and an AUC of 0.78 from Paris to Liège datasets. Using simulations, we subsequently demonstrate that multivariate pattern classification has a decisive performance advantage over univariate classification as the stability of EEG features decreases, as different EEG configurations are used for feature-extraction or as noise is added. Moreover, we show that the generalization performance from Paris to Liège remains stable even if up to 20% of the diagnostic labels are randomly flipped. Finally, consistent with recent literature, analysis of the learned decision rules of our classifier suggested that markers related to dynamic fluctuations in theta and alpha frequency bands carried independent information and were most influential. Our findings demonstrate that EEG markers of consciousness can be reliably, economically and automatically identified with machine learning in various clinical and acquisition contexts.","",""

Statistical Query (SQ) algorithms are a class of algorithms that are only allowed to query expectations of functions of the distribution rather than directly access samples. This class of algorithms is quite broad: a wide range of known algorithmic techniques in machine learning are known to be implementable using SQs.Moreover, for the unsupervised learning problems studied in this paper, all known algorithms with non-trivial performance guarantees are SQ or are easily implementable using SQs. Our SQ lower bound for Problem (1)is qualitatively matched by known learning algorithms for GMMs. At a conceptual level, this result implies that &#x2013; as far as SQ algorithms are concerned &#x2013; the computational complexity of learning GMMs is inherently exponential in the dimension of the latent space} &#x2013; even though there is no such information-theoretic barrier.

On the positive side, we also give a new (SQ) learning algorithm for Problem (2) achievingthe information-theoretically optimal accuracy, up to a constant factor, whose running time essentially matches our lower bound. Our algorithm relies on a filtering technique generalizing \cite{DiakonikolasKKLMS16} that removes outliers based on higher-order tensors.Our SQ lower bounds are attained via a unified moment-matching technique that is useful in other contexts and may be of broader interest. Our technique yields nearly-tight lower bounds for a number of related unsupervised estimation problems. Specifically, for the problems of (3) robust covariance estimation in spectral norm, and (4) robust sparse mean estimation, we establish a quadratic statistical&#x2013;computational tradeoff} for SQ algorithms, matching known upper bounds. Finally, our technique can be used to obtain tight sample complexitylower bounds for high-dimensional testing} problems.

On one hand, traditional co-saliency detection approaches rely heavily on human knowledge for designing hand-crafted metrics to possibly reflect the faithful properties of the co-salient regions. Such strategies, however, always suffer from poor generalization capability to flexibly adapt various scenarios in real applications. On the other hand, most current methods pursue co-saliency detection in unsupervised fashions. This, however, tends to weaken their performance in real complex scenarios because they are lack of robust learning mechanism to make full use of the weak labels of each image. To alleviate these two problems, this paper proposes a new SP-MIL framework for co-saliency detection, which integrates both multiple instance learning (MIL) and self-paced learning (SPL) into a unified learning framework. Specifically, for the first problem, we formulate the co-saliency detection problem as a MIL paradigm to learn the discriminative classifiers to detect the co-saliency object in the “instance-level”. The formulated MIL component facilitates our method capable of automatically producing the proper metrics to measure the intra-image contrast and the inter-image consistency for detecting co-saliency in a purely self-learning way. For the second problem, the embedded SPL paradigm is able to alleviate the data ambiguity under the weak supervision of co-saliency detection and guide a robust learning manner in complex scenarios. Experiments on benchmark datasets together with multiple extended computer vision applications demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework beyond the state-of-the-arts.","",""

As reliance on ML-enabled systems grows, it is imperative to study the performance of these systems under malicious state and actuator attacks. Traditional control systems employ resilient/fault-tolerant controllers that counter these attacks by correcting the system via error observations. However, in some applications, a resilient controller may not be sufficient to avoid a catastrophic failure. Ideally, a robust approach is more useful in these scenarios where a system is inherently robust (by design) to adversarial attacks.

Automated track inspection using computer vision and pattern recognition methods has recently shown the potential to improve safety by allowing for more frequent inspections while reducing human errors. Achieving full automation is still very challenging due to the number of different possible failure modes, as well as the broad range of image variations that can potentially trigger false alarms. In addition, the number of defective components is very small, so not many training examples are available for the machine to learn a robust anomaly detector. In this paper, we show that detection performance can be improved by combining multiple detectors within a multitask learning framework. We show that this approach results in improved accuracy for detecting defects on railway ties and fasteners.","",""

Because the SVM methods use the hinge loss or squared hinge loss functions for classifications, they usually outperform other classification approaches, e.g. the least square loss function based methods. However, like most supervised learning algorithms, they learn classifiers based on the labeled data in training set without specific strategy to deal with the noise data. In many real-world applications, we often have data outliers in train set, which could misguide the classifiers learning, such that the classification performance is suboptimal. To address this problem, we proposed a novel capped Lp-norm SVM classification model by utilizing the capped `p-norm based hinge loss in the objective which can deal with both light and heavy outliers. We utilize the new formulation to naturally build the multiclass capped Lp-norm SVM. More importantly, we derive a novel optimization algorithms to efficiently minimize the capped Lp-norm based objectives, and also rigorously prove the convergence of proposed algorithms. We present experimental results showing that employing the new capped Lp-norm SVM method can consistently improve the classification performance, especially in the cases when the data noise level increases.

An important theory in financial markets is mean reversion, which plays a critical role in some state-of-the-art portfolio selection strategies. Although existing mean reversion strategies have been shown to achieve good empirical performance on certain datasets, they seldom carefully deal with noise and outliers in the data, leading to suboptimal portfolios, and consequently yielding poor performance in practice. In this paper, we propose to exploit the reversion phenomenon by using robust <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX""> $L_1$</tex-math><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:type=""simple"" xlink:href=""huang-ieq1-2563433.gif""/></alternatives> </inline-formula>-median estimators, and design a novel online portfolio selection strategy named “Robust Median Reversion” (RMR), which constructs optimal portfolios based on the improved reversion estimator. We examine the performance of the proposed algorithms on various real markets with extensive experiments. Empirical results show that RMR can overcome the drawbacks of existing mean reversion algorithms and achieve significantly better results. Finally, RMR runs in linear time, and thus is suitable for large-scale real-time algorithmic trading applications.","",""

It is more challenging as the description must not only capture the ground elements of different scales, but also express their attributes as well as how these elements interact with each other. Despite the difficulties, we have proposed a remote sensing image captioning framework by leveraging the techniques of the recent fast development of deep learning and fully convolutional networks. The experimental results on a set of high-resolution optical images including Google Earth images and GaoFen-2 satellite images demonstrate that the proposed method is able to generate robust and comprehensive sentence description with desirable speed performance.","",""

Multitemporal Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapperplus (ETM+) imagery is used to assess the performance of three Artificial Neural Networks ‐ Multi-Layer Perceptron, ARTMAP, Self-Organizing Map, and two Classification Tree splitting algorithms: gini and entropy rules. MLA performance evaluations are based on susceptibility to reduced training set size, noise, and variations in the training set, as well as the operability/transparency of the classification process. Classification trees produced the most accurate selective logging maps (gini and entropy rule decision tree mean overall map accuracy � 94 percent and mean per-class kappa of 0.59 and 0.60, respectively). Classification trees are shown to be more robust and accurate when faced with deficient training data, regardless of splitting rule. Of the neural network algorithms, self-organizing maps were least sensitive to the introduction of noise and variations in training data. Given their robust classification capabilities and transparency of the classselection process, classification trees are preferable algorithms for mapping selective logging and have potential in other forest monitoring applications.","",""

In this work we describe first a method for monitoring and modeling of performance degradation in SOA applications, particularly application servers. This method works for a large class of the aging processes caused by resource depletion (e.g. memory leaks). It can be deployed non-intrusively in a production environment, under arbitrary service request distributions. Based on this schema we investigate in the second part of the paper how machine learning (classification) algorithms can be used for proactive detection of performance degradation or sudden drops caused by aging. We leverage the predictive power of these algorithms with several techniques to make the measurement-based aging models more adaptive and more robust against transient failures. We evaluate several state-of-the-art classification methods for their accuracy and computational efficiency in this scenario. The studies are performed on a data set generated by a TPC-W benchmark instrumented with a memory leak injector. The results show that the probing method yields accurate aging models with low overhead and the machine learning approach gives statistically significant short-term predictions of degrading application performance. Both approaches can be used directly to fight aging via adaptive software rejuvenation (restart of the application), for operator alerting, or for short-term capacity planning.","",""

However, AdaBoost tends to overfit to the noisy data in many applications. Accordingly, improving the antinoise ability of AdaBoost plays an important role in many applications. The sensitiveness to the noisy data of AdaBoost stems from the exponential loss function, which puts unrestricted penalties to the misclassified samples with very large margins. In this paper, we propose two boosting algorithms, referred to as RBoost1 and RBoost2, which are more robust to the noisy data compared with AdaBoost. RBoost1 and RBoost2 optimize a nonconvex loss function of the classification margin. Because the penalties to the misclassified samples are restricted to an amount less than one, RBoost1 and RBoost2 do not overfocus on the samples that are always misclassified by the previous base learners. Besides the loss function, at each boosting iteration, RBoost1 and RBoost2 use numerically stable ways to compute the base learners. These two improvements contribute to the robustness of the proposed algorithms to the noisy training and testing samples. Experimental results on the synthetic Gaussian data set, the UCI data sets, and a real malware behavior data set illustrate that the proposed RBoost1 and RBoost2 algorithms perform better when the training data sets contain noisy data.","",""
