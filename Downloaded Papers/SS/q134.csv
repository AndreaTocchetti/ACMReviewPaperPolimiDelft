At the same time, very high spatial resolution imagery presents a new challenge over other satellite systems, in that a relatively large amount of data must be analyzed and corrected for registration and classification errors to identify the land cover changes, commonly resulting in a very extensive manual work. To improve on this situation we have developed a new method for land surface change detection that greatly reduces the human effort needed to remove the errors that occur with many methods applied to very high spatial resolution imagery. This change detection algorithm is based on Neural Networks and it is able to exploit in parallel both the multi-band and the multi-temporal data to discriminate between real changes and false alarms. In general the classification errors are reduced by a factor of 2-3 using this new method over a simple Post Classification Comparison based on a neural network classification of the same images.","",""

In this paper, we introduce a general model of deep neural network (DNN)-based modulation classifiers for single-input single-output (SISO) systems. Its feasibility is analyzed using maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) criterion and its robustness to uncertain noise conditions is compared to that of the conventional maximum likelihood (ML)-based classifiers. To reduce the design and training cost of DNN classifiers, a simple but effective pre-processing method is introduced and adopted. Furthermore, featuring multiple recurrent neural network (RNN) layers, the DNN modulation classifier is realized. Simulation results show that the proposed RNN-based classifier is robust to the uncertain noise conditions, and the performance of it approaches to that of the ideal ML classifier with perfect channel and noise information. Moreover, with a much lower complexity, it outperforms the existing ML-based classifiers, specifically, expectation maximization (EM) and expectation conditional maximization (ECM) classifiers which iteratively estimate channel and noise parameters. In addition, the proposed classifier is shown to be invariant to the signal distortion such as frequency offset. Furthermore, the adopted pre-processing method is shown to accelerate the training process of our proposed classifier, thus reducing the training cost. Lastly, the computational complexity of our proposed classifier is analyzed and compared to other traditional ones, which further demonstrates its overall advantage.","",""

In this article, an radial basis function (RBF) neural network based adaptive robust control design is proposed for nonlinear bilateral teleoperation manipulators to cope with the main issues including the communication time delay, various nonlinearities, and uncertainties. Specifically, the slave environmental dynamics is modeled by a general RBF neural network, and its parameters are estimated and then transmitted for the environmental torque reconstruction in the master side. Since the parameters of the neural network (which are nonpower signals) are transmitted instead of the traditional environmental torque in the communication channel, the previous existing passivity problem under time delay is avoided. In both of master and slave sides, the trajectory creators are applied to generate the desired trajectories, and the RBF-neural-network-based adaptive robust controllers are designed subsequently to handle the nonlinearities and uncertainties. Theoretically, the proposed control algorithm can guarantee the global stability of bilateral teleoperation manipulators under time delay, and the good transparency performance with both position tracking and force feedback is also achieved simultaneously. The real platform comparative experiments are carried out, and the results show the good position tracking to execute precise operation and the good force feedback to detect the sudden disturbance in the environment dynamics.","",""

Recently, radio frequency (RF) fingerprint-based identification schemes have attracted wide attention as they extract the inherent characteristics of hardware circuits which is very hard to forge. However, existing RF fingerprint-based approaches face the problems of unstable region of interest (ROI), high-cost feature design, and incomplete automation. To address these problems, this paper proposes a multisampling convolutional neural network (MSCNN) to extract RF fingerprint from the selected ROI for classifying ZigBee devices. A signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) adaptive ROI selection algorithm is also developed to alleviate the effect of semi-steady behavior of ZigBee devices owing to sleep mode switching.

Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the feasibility and reliability of MSCNN both in the line-of-sight (LOS) scenarios and non-LOS (NLOS) scenarios.

However, their robustness against adversarial attacks is criticized. Prior studies show that using unnoticeable modifications on graph topology or nodal features can significantly reduce the performances of GNNs. It is very challenging to design robust graph neural networks against poisoning attack and several efforts have been taken. Existing work aims at reducing the negative impact from adversarial edges only with the poisoned graph, which is sub-optimal since they fail to discriminate adversarial edges from normal ones. On the other hand, clean graphs from similar domains as the target poisoned graph are usually available in the real world. By perturbing these clean graphs, we create supervised knowledge to train the ability to detect adversarial edges so that the robustness of GNNs is elevated. However, such potential for clean graphs is neglected by existing work. To this end, we investigate a novel problem of improving the robustness of GNNs against poisoning attacks by exploring clean graphs. Specifically, we propose PA-GNN, which relies on a penalized aggregation mechanism that directly restrict the negative impact of adversarial edges by assigning them lower attention coefficients. To optimize PA-GNN for a poisoned graph, we design a meta-optimization algorithm that trains PA-GNN to penalize perturbations using clean graphs and their adversarial counterparts, and transfers such ability to improve the robustness of PA-GNN on the poisoned graph. Experimental results on four real-world datasets demonstrate the robustness of PA-GNN against poisoning attacks on graphs.","",""

Several recent works attempt to mitigate these overheads by designing compact networks using pruning of connections. However, we observe that most of the existing strategies to design compact networks fail to preserve network robustness against adversarial examples. In this work, we rigorously study the extension of network pruning strategies to preserve both benign accuracy and robustness of a network. Starting with a formal definition of the pruning procedure, including pre-training, weights pruning, and fine-tuning, we propose a new pruning method that can create compact networks while preserving both benign accuracy and robustness. Our method is based on two main insights: (1) we ensure that the training objectives of the pre-training and fine-tuning steps match the training objective of the desired robust model (e.g., adversarial robustness/verifiable robustness), and (2) we keep the pruning strategy agnostic to pre-training and fine-tuning objectives. We evaluate our method on four different networks on the CIFAR-10 dataset and measure benign accuracy, empirical robust accuracy, and verifiable robust accuracy. We demonstrate that our pruning method can preserve on average 93\% benign accuracy, 92.5\% empirical robust accuracy, and 85.0\% verifiable robust accuracy while compressing the tested network by 10$\times$.","",""

In order to create smarter robotic prosthetic devices to be used in an everyday context, one must be able to interface them seamlessly with the end-user in an inexpensive, yet reliable way. In this paper, we are looking at guiding a robotic device by detecting gestures through measurement of the electrical activity of muscles captured by surface electromyography (sEMG). Reliable sEMG-based gesture classifiers for end-users are challenging to design, as they must be extremely robust to signal drift, muscle fatigue and small electrode displacement without the need for constant recalibration. In spite of extensive research, sophisticated sEMG classifiers for prostheses guidance are not yet widely used, as systems often fail to solve these issues simultaneously.

Four design variables and two noise variables are included in the experiment, a full factorial design is adopted for the design matrix to estimate all main and two factor interaction effects, and the signal-to-noise (SN) ratio is used as a performance measure for achieving robustness. In the second experiment, only a fraction of the full factorial design is used as the design matrix and the results are compared with those from the full factorial experiment in terms of prediction accuracy.

All unknown but repeatable non‐linear functions are approximated by outputs of multi‐layer neural networks to achieve a better model compensation for an improved performance. All NN weights are tuned on‐line with no prior training needed.

Certain robust control terms are constructed to attenuate various model uncertainties effectively for a guaranteed output tracking transient performance and a guaranteed final tracking accuracy in general. In addition, if the unknown repeatable model uncertainties are in the functional range of the neural networks and the ideal weights fall within the prescribed range, asymptotic output tracking is also achieved to retain the perfect learning capability of neural networks in the ideal situation.

SAART embeds new neural mechanisms (selective presynaptic facilitation and selective presynaptic inhibition) into a dynamic neural network that is capable of selective attention and visual perception. These new features enable the network to learn effectively in noisy inputs and to recognize familiar 2-D patterns of neural activity (representations of object's boundary) in complex, cluttered and noisy background.

In this study, a multi-point robust design optimization method has been systematically established for the wind turbine airfoil. The objective is to not only maximize the lift-to-drag ratio and lift coefficient at and near the design point, but also minimize their sensitivity to the leading edge roughness associated with the geometry profile uncertainty. The geometry parameterization of the airfoil is conducted by the Bezier curves. In the robust optimization, the multi-objective genetic algorithm, Monte Carlo simulation technique, and artificial neural network model are used. The results show that both the robust Pareto optimal (RPO) and deterministic Pareto optimal (DPO) airfoils have higher lift-to-drag ratio and lift coefficient than the original design FX 63-137 at and near the design point. A smaller maximum camber and larger radii near the leading edge help the RPO airfoil outperform both the DPO and original ones in terms of low sensitivity to the leading edge roughness.

In contrast to previous related methods that usually adopt relatively simple and shallow neural network architectures to address emotion recognition task, our HoloNet has three critical considerations in network design. (1) To reduce redundant filters and enhance the non-saturated non-linearity in the lower convolutional layers, we use a modified Concatenated Rectified Linear Unit (CReLU) instead of ReLU. (2) To enjoy the accuracy gain from considerably increased network depth and maintain efficiency, we combine residual structure and CReLU to construct the middle layers. (3) To broaden network width and introduce multi-scale feature extraction property, the topper layers are designed as a variant of inception-residual structure. The main benefit of grouping these modules into the HoloNet is that both negative and positive phase information implicitly contained in the input data can flow over it in multiple paths, thus deep multi-scale features explicitly capturing emotion variation can be well extracted from multi-path sibling layers, and then can be further concatenated for robust recognition.

Further, a robustifying term is developed to compensate for the NN approximation errors introduced by implementing the ADP method. Based on Lyapunov approach, stability analysis of the closed-loop system is performed to show that the proposed controller guarantees the system state asymptotically tracking the desired trajectory. Additionally, the obtained control input is proven to be close to the optimal control input within a small bound. Finally, two numerical examples are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.","",""

The energy conservation principle is adopted to build a mathematical model of the motor-mechanism-coupled system. Moreover, a robust FNN control system is developed for stabilizing and tracking control of the dual-axis inverted-pendulum system. In this control system, a FNN controller is used to learn an equivalent control law as in the traditional sliding-mode control, and a robust controller is designed to ensure the near total sliding motion through the entire state trajectory without a reaching phase. The salient advantages of this FNN-based control scheme are as follows. 1) It does not require a perfect knowledge of system uncertainties so that this brings a high level of autonomy to the overall system and make the use of this control scheme very attractive for real time applications. 2) All adaptive learning algorithms in this control system are derived in the sense of Lyapunov stability analysis, so that system-tracking stability can be guaranteed in the closed-loop system. 3) Not only the weight vector in the rule-to-output layer are adjusted on line but also the mean and the standard deviation of Gaussian functions in the membership function layer. This training scheme will increase the learning capability of the FNN. 4) An adaptive bound estimation algorithm is investigated to relax the requirement for the bound of uncertain term including the minimum reconstructed error, higher-order term in Taylor series, and network parameters approximation error.

The popular practise is making the model biggerﬁrst, and then train it with data augmentation using ex-tensive scale-jittering. In this paper, we propose a scale-invariant convolutional neural network (SiCNN), a modeldesigned to incorporate multi-scale feature exaction andclassiﬁcation into the network structure. SiCNN uses amulti-column architecture, with each column focusing on aparticular scale. Unlike previous multi-column strategies,these columns share the same set of ﬁlter parameters by ascale transformation among them. This design deals withscale variation without blowing up the model size. Experi-mental results show that SiCNN detects features at variousscales, and the classiﬁcation result exhibits strong robust-ness against object scale variations. 1. Introduction Many classical computer vision tasks have enjoyed agreat breakthrough, primarily due to the large amount oftraining data and the application of deep convolution neu-ral networks (CNN) [8]. In the most recent ILSVRC 2014competition [11], CNN-based solutions have achieved near-human accuracies in image classiﬁcation, localization anddetection tasks [14,16].Accompanying this progress are studies trying to under-stand what CNN has learnt internally and what contributeto its success [2,13,17]. By design, layers within the net-work have progressively larger receptive ﬁeld sizes, allow-ing them to learn more complex features. Another key pointis the shift-invariance property, that a pattern in the inputcan be recognized regardless of its position [9]. Pooling lay-ers contribute resilience to slight deformation as well smallscale change [12].However, it is evident that CNN deals with shift-variancefar better than scale-invariance [3]. Not dealing with scale-invariance well poses a direct conﬂict to the design philos-ophy of CNN, in that higher layers may see and thus cap-tures features of certain plain patterns simply because theyare larger at the input, not because they are more complex.In other words, there is no alignments between in the posi-tion of a ﬁlter and the complexity it captures. What is more,there are other invariance that CNN does not deal with inter-nally. Examples include rotations and ﬂips (since featuresof natural objects are mostly symmetric).A brutal force solution would be to make the networklarger by introducing more ﬁlters to cope with scale vari-ations of the same feature, accompanied by scale-jitteringthe input images, often by order of magnitude. This is, infact, the popular practice today [1,8,14]. It is true even forproposals that directly deal with this problem. For example,[3] drives the CNN with crops of different size and positionswith three differnt scales, and then uses VLAD pooling toproduce a feature summary of the patches.We explore a radically different approach that is alsosimple. Observing that ﬁlters that detect the same patternbut with different scales bear strong relationship, we adopt amulti-column design and designate each column to special-ize on certain scales. We call our system SiCNN (Scale-invariant CNN). Unlike a conventional multi-column CNN,ﬁlters in SiCNN are strongly regulated among columns.The goal is to make the network resilient to scale variancewithout blowing up number of free parameters, and thus re-duce the need of jittering the input.We performed detailed analysis and veriﬁed that SiCNNexhibits the desired behavior. For example, the column thatdeals with larger scale is indeed activated by input patternswith the larger scaling factor, and the system as a wholebecomes less sensitive to scale variance.

Additionally, in this NNAC system design, an error estimation mechanism is investigated to estimate the bound of approximation error so that the chattering phenomenon of the control effort can be reduced. Simulation and experimental results show that the proposed NNAC servomotor control systems can achieve favorable tracking and robust performance with regard to parameter variations and external load disturbances.","",""

A gradient type of learning rule is not easy to realize in an electronic system, since calculation of the gradients for all weights in the network is very difficult. More suitable is the simultaneous perturbation method, since the learning rule requires only forward operations of the network to modify weights unlike the backpropagation method. In addition, pulse density NN systems have some promising properties, as they are robust to noisy situations and can handle analog quantities based on the digital circuits. We describe a field-programmable gate array realization of a pulse density NN using the simultaneous perturbation method as the learning scheme.

By online approximating the uncertain leader dynamics, the proposed method only uses the measurements of line-of-sight range and angle by local sensors, no other information about leader is required for control implementation. The proposed control law is model-independent that does not rely on the accurate model of the vehicle, which is difficult to obtain in practice. Based on the Lyapunov synthesis, it is proved that with the developed neural formation controller, all the tracking errors converge to a small neighbourhood of zero. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.","",""

This sharply deviates from traditional machine learning and necessitates the design of algorithms robust to various sources of heterogeneity. Specifically, statistical heterogeneity of data across user devices can severely degrade the performance of standard federated averaging for traditional machine learning applications like personalization with deep learning. This paper pro-posesFedPer, a base + personalization layer approach for federated training of deep feedforward neural networks, which can combat the ill-effects of statistical heterogeneity.

To enhance the noise rejection capability of the digital controller, the resetting filters (RFs) are utilized as prefilters before the analog/digital sampling stage. A robust deadbeat current control law is derived based on the average current tracking scheme, where the effect of the RFs is favorably incorporated. To alleviate the difficulties in current controller design, the ac-side capacitor voltage of the HAPF is estimated by using the adaptive linear neural network identifier in the load current feedforward loop. Hence, a simple proportional controller is utilized in the inner current loop. Moreover, the grid current feedback and load current feedforward strategies are used to achieve precise current tracking and fast dynamic response. A 75-kVA prototype system is built for verification. The validity of the proposed HAPF and its control algorithms are confirmed by the experimental results.","",""

The cells are fixed on a 2D grid and exchange ""chemicals"" with their neighbors during the growth process. The quantity of chemicals that a cell produces, as well as the differentiation value of the cell in the phenotype, are controlled by a Neural Network (the genotype) that takes as inputs the chemicals produced by the neighboring cells at the previous time step. In the proposed model, the number of iterations of the growth process is not pre-determined, but emerges during evolution: only organisms for which the growth process stabilizes give a phenotype (the stable state), others are declared nonviable. The optimization of the controller is done using the NEAT algorithm, that optimizes both the topology and the weights of the Neural Networks. Though each cell only receives local information from its neighbors, the experimental results of the proposed approach on the 'flags' problems (the phenotype must match a given 2D pattern) are almost as good as those of a direct regression approach using the same model with global information. Moreover, the resulting multi-cellular organisms exhibit almost perfect self-healing characteristics.","",""

In the attitude angle loop, a robust adaptive virtual control law is designed by using the adaptive method to estimate the unknown upper bound of the compound uncertainties. In the angular velocity loop, an adaptive sliding mode control law is designed to suppress the effect of parameter variations and external disturbances. The main benefit of the sliding mode control is robustness to parameter variations and external disturbances. To further improve the control performance, RBFNNs are introduced to approximate the compound uncertainties in the attitude angle loop and angular velocity loop, respectively. Based on Lyapunov stability theory, the tracking errors are shown to be asymptotically stable. Simulation results show that the proposed control system attains a satisfied control performance and is robust against parameter variations and external disturbances.","",""
