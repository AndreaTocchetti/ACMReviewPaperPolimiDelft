Real-world graphs are often noisy and contain task-irrelevant edges, which may lead to suboptimal generalization performance in the learned GNN models. In this paper, we propose PTDNet, a parameterized topological denoising network, to improve the robustness and generalization performance of GNNs by learning to drop task-irrelevant edges. PTDNet prunes task-irrelevant edges by penalizing the number of edges in the sparsified graph with parameterized networks. To take into consideration the topology of the entire graph, the nuclear norm regularization is applied to impose the low-rank constraint on the resulting sparsified graph for better generalization. PTDNet can be used as a key component in GNN models to improve their performances on various tasks, such as node classification and link prediction.

We propose a technique that combines the strengths of these two approaches: a generic nonlinear control policy class, parameterized by neural networks, that nonetheless enforces the same provable robustness criteria as robust control.

To overcome this problem, we introduce a defensive mechanism called DeepCloak. By identifying and removing unnecessary features in a DNN model, DeepCloak limits the capacity an attacker can use generating adversarial samples and therefore increase the robustness against such inputs.

This shortcoming is mainly due to the lack of insight and practical algorithms to construct the necessary connectivity. Any such algorithm typically attempts to build networks by iteratively reducing the error compared to a desired output. But assigning credit to hidden units in multi-layered spiking networks has remained challenging due to the non-differentiable nonlinearity of spikes. To avoid this issue, one can employ surrogate gradients to discover the required connectivity in spiking network models. However, the choice of a surrogate is not unique, raising the question of how its implementation influences the effectiveness of the method. Here, we use numerical simulations to systematically study how essential design parameters of surrogate gradients impact learning performance on a range of classification problems. We show that surrogate gradient learning is robust to different shapes of underlying surrogate derivatives, but the choice of the derivative’s scale can substantially affect learning performance. When we combine surrogate gradients with a suitable activity regularization technique, robust information processing can be achieved in spiking networks even at the sparse activity limit.

However, to estimate an accurate capacity of SOC of the lithium-ion battery has become a major concern for the electric vehicle (EV) industry. Therefore, numerous researches are being conducted to address the challenges and to enhance the battery performance. The main objective of this paper is to develop an accurate SOC estimation approach for a lithium-ion battery by improving back-propagation neural network (BPNN) capability using backtracking search algorithm (BSA). BSA optimization is utilized to improve the accuracy and robustness of BPNN model by finding the optimal value of hidden layer neurons and learning rate. In this paper, Dynamic Stress Test and Federal Urban Driving Schedule drive profiles are applied for testing the model at three different temperatures. The obtained results of the BPNN based BSA model are compared with the radial basis function neural network, generalized regression neural network and extreme learning machine model using statistical error values of root mean square error, mean absolute error, mean absolute percentage error, and SOC error to check and validate the model performance. The obtained results show that the BPNN based BSA model outperforms other neural network models in estimating SOC with high accuracy under different EV profiles and temperatures.","",""

According to offline metrics, user studies, as well as A/B tests, our approach generates higher-quality recommendations than comparable deep learning based systems. To our knowledge, this is by far the largest application of deep graph embeddings to date and paves the way for a new generation of web-scale recommender systems based on graph convolutional architectures.","",""

The origin of this variability is uncertain, but it is usually interpreted as detrimental noise that reduces the computational accuracy of neural circuits. Here we investigate the possibility that such response variability might in fact be beneficial, because it may partially compensate for a decrease in accuracy due to stochastic changes in the synaptic strengths of a network. We study the interplay between two kinds of noise, response (or neuronal) noise and synaptic noise, by analyzing their joint influence on the accuracy of neural networks trained to perform various tasks. We find an interesting, generic interaction: when fluctuations in the synaptic connections are proportional to their strengths (multiplicative noise), a certain amount of response noise in the input neurons can significantly improve network performance, compared to the same network without response noise. Performance is enhanced because response noise and multiplicative synaptic noise are in some ways equivalent. So if the algorithm used to find the optimal synaptic weights can take into account the variability of the model neurons, it can also take into account the variability of the synapses. Thus, the connection patterns generated with response noise are typically more resistant to synaptic degradation than those obtained without response noise. As a consequence of this interplay, if multiplicative synaptic noise is present, it is better to have response noise in the network than not to have it. These results are demonstrated analytically for the most basic network consisting of two input neurons and one output neuron performing a simple classification task, but computer simulations show that the phenomenon persists in a wide range of architectures, including recurrent (attractor) networks and sensorimotor networks that perform coordinate transformations. The results suggest that response variability could play an important dynamic role in networks that continuously learn.","",""

Applying neural networks to robotics should drastically increase the capabilities of robots to navigate and interact with the world around them. However, robots are often used to investigate environments too dangerous for humans. Such environments include areas with high levels of radiation such as the Fukushima reactor or Jovian moons. Radiation causes single event upset (SEU) errors such as unexpected bit flips so robots must be robust to those kinds of errors. Before robots can fully utilize the advances of neural networks, the networks must be tested for their robustness against SEUs. SEUs are most likely to cause bit flips within the trained parameters of a neural network. This is because the memory that stores the trained parameters takes up the most surface area of a computer, and thus is more likely to be hit by high energy particles. Previous papers in this field have focused on older networks such as Multi-Layer Perceptrons, but Convolutional Neural Networks are the current state of the art when it comes to object classification tasks. This paper tests several modern neural network architectures for their robustness to bit flips in their weights and examines which aspects of each different architecture lead to greater robustness. The different architectures tested are VGG16, ResNet50, and InceptionV3. The experiments show that all three networks display bimodal distributions under memory errors, meaning that the networks either retain their trained classification accuracy, or drop to very low accuracies. Additionally, it only takes a small number of memory errors compared to the total size of the network for the neural network's performance to significantly degrade. When comparing the three architectures, VGG16 was the least robust against random bit flips in its trained weights while ResNet50 and InceptionV3 had similar levels of robustness against SEU-type memory errors. Some possible reasons for ResNet50 and Inception V3's robustness are their use of batch normalization or their use of shortcut connections.","",""

The on-going work on design and construction of spike-based hardware platforms offers an alternative for running deep neural networks with significantly lower power consumption, but has to overcome hardware limitations in terms of noise and limited weight precision, as well as noise inherent in the sensor signal. This article investigates how such hardware constraints impact the performance of spiking neural network implementations of DBNs. In particular, the influence of limited bit precision during execution and training, and the impact of silicon mismatch in the synaptic weight parameters of custom hybrid VLSI implementations is studied. Furthermore, the network performance of spiking DBNs is characterized with regard to noise in the spiking input signal. Our results demonstrate that spiking DBNs can tolerate very low levels of hardware bit precision down to almost two bits, and show that their performance can be improved by at least 30% through an adapted training mechanism that takes the bit precision of the target platform into account. Spiking DBNs thus present an important use-case for large-scale hybrid analog-digital or digital neuromorphic platforms such as SpiNNaker, which can execute large but precision-constrained deep networks in real time.","",""

To quantify this robustness, we show that one such network achieves 11% test error on CIFAR-10 even with 0.68 effective bits per weight. Furthermore, we find that a common training heuristic--namely, projecting quantized weights during backpropagation--can be altered (or even removed) and networks still achieve a base level of robustness during testing. Specifically, training with weight projections other than quantization also works, as does simply clipping the weights, both of which have never been reported before.

Method performance on both sets of test images is better than other existing solutions in literature. The method proves especially accurate for vessel detection in STARE images. Its application to this database (even when the NN was trained on the DRIVE database) outperforms all analyzed segmentation approaches.

By factorizing the weight matrix into a low-rank approximation, an estimation of the sign of the pre-nonlinearity activation can be efficiently obtained. For networks using rectified-linear hidden units, this implies that the computation of a hidden unit with an estimated negative pre-nonlinearity can be ommitted altogether, as its value will become zero when nonlinearity is applied.

How to enhance the robustness of GCNs remains a critical open problem. To address this problem, we propose Robust GCN (RGCN), a novel model that ""fortifies'' GCNs against adversarial attacks. Specifically, instead of representing nodes as vectors, our method adopts Gaussian distributions as the hidden representations of nodes in each convolutional layer. In this way, when the graph is attacked, our model can automatically absorb the effects of adversarial changes in the variances of the Gaussian distributions.

We consider robust transfer learning, in which we transfer not only performance but also robustness from a source model to a target domain.

By training classifiers on top of these feature extractors, we produce new models that inherit the robustness of their parent networks. We then consider the case of fine tuning a network by re-training end-to-end in the target domain. When using lifelong learning strategies, this process preserves the robustness of the source network while achieving high accuracy. By using such strategies, it is possible to produce accurate and robust models with little data, and without the cost of adversarial training.

Hence, a gravitational search algorithm (GSA) is applied to improve the ELM computational intelligence by searching for the optimal value hidden layer neurons. The optimal ELM-based GSA model does not require internal battery knowledge and mathematical model for an SOC estimation. The model robustness is validated at different temperatures using different electric vehicle drive cycles. The performance of the ELM-GSA model is verified with two popular neural network methods: back-propagation neural network (BPNN) and radial basis function neural network (RBFNN). The results are evaluated using different error rates and computation costs. The results demonstrate that the ELM-based GSA model offers a higher accuracy and lower SOC error rate than those of BPNN-based GSA and RBFNN-based GSA models. Furthermore, a detailed comparative study between the proposed model and existing SOC strategies is conducted, which also demonstrates the superiority of the proposed model.","",""

Given information of the previous motion, this task model is able to predict occurrence probabilities of the motions concerned in the task. Furthermore, a hybrid motion classification framework has been developed based on the BN motion prediction. Besides the motion prediction, electromyogram (EMG) signals are simultaneously classified by a probabilistic neural network (NN). Then, the motion occurrence probabilities are combined with the NN classifier's outputs to generate motion commands for control. With the proposed motion classification framework, it is expected that classification performance can be enhanced so that motion commands can be more robust and reliable. Experiments have been conducted with four subjects to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed methods.

Because it resembles a traditional finite-difference approximation of the reward gradient, it can naturally be confused with one. However, this ES optimizes for a different gradient than just reward: It optimizes for the average reward of the entire population, thereby seeking parameters that are robust to perturbation. This difference can channel ES into distinct areas of the search space relative to gradient descent, and also consequently to networks with distinct properties. This unique robustness-seeking property, and its consequences for optimization, are demonstrated in several domains.

All performance comparisons were based on paired-samples t tests.   RESULTS The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (A(z)) was 0.952 +/- 0.014 for the first set, 0.982 +/- 0.004 for the first set as the training set and the second set as the prediction set, 0.954 +/- 0.016 for the second set as the training set and the first set as the prediction set, and 0.950 +/- 0.005 for all 271 lesions.

In the attitude angle loop, a robust adaptive virtual control law is designed by using the adaptive method to estimate the unknown upper bound of the compound uncertainties. In the angular velocity loop, an adaptive sliding mode control law is designed to suppress the effect of parameter variations and external disturbances. The main benefit of the sliding mode control is robustness to parameter variations and external disturbances. To further improve the control performance, RBFNNs are introduced to approximate the compound uncertainties in the attitude angle loop and angular velocity loop, respectively. Based on Lyapunov stability theory, the tracking errors are shown to be asymptotically stable. Simulation results show that the proposed control system attains a satisfied control performance and is robust against parameter variations and external disturbances.","",""

The building considered is a 76‐storey 306 m concrete office tower controlled by an active tuned mass damper (ATMD). The control strategy proposes two neural network (NN) models functioning together online to control the building. The first NN predicts the building's future responses and the second mimics the inverse dynamics of the building control force model, and operates on the future response with set of if–then rules to issue the required control force. Next, both NN models operate jointly to train a separate feed‐forward neural network model designated as the NN controller (NNC). The efficacy of the two neural networks as well as the NN controller are examined and compared with a linear quadratic Gaussian controller. The controllers' performance and robustness are verified and presented, with stiffness uncertainty, time‐delay, measurements' noise and some sensor failure. The results reveal the robustness and the effectiveness of the proposed method in alleviating wind‐induced vibration for tall buildings. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","",""

The objective of this paper is to investigate the use of neural networks in ALSs and to make these systems more intelligent. Current flight control law is adopted in the intelligent controller design. Tracking performance and robustness are demonstrated through software simulations. This paper presents five different neural network controllers to improve the performance of conventional ALSs based on a modified learning-through-time process.

The proposed neural force control scheme is capable of making the robot track a specified desired force as well as of compensating for uncertainties in environment location and stiffness, and in robot dynamics. Separate training signals for free-space motion and contact-space motion control are developed to train the neural compensator online. The design of the training signals is justified.

In this paper, we establish the existence and utility of feature maps selective to action units in a deep CNN trained by transfer learning. We transfer a network pre-trained on the Image-Net dataset to the facial expression recognition task using the Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces (KDEF), Radboud Faces Database(RaFD) and extended Cohn-Kanade (CK+) database. We demonstrate that higher convolutional layers of the deep CNN trained on generic images are selective to facial action units. We also show that feature selection is critical in achieving robustness, with action unit selective feature maps being more critical in the facial expression recognition task. These results support the hypothesis that both human and deeply learned CNNs use similar mechanisms for recognizing facial expressions.","",""

Memristors can remember the historical profiles of the excitations and record them as analog variables. The similarity to biological synaptic behavior has encouraged a lot of research on memristor-based neuromorphic hardware system. In this work, we explore the potential of a memristor crossbar array as an auto-associative memory. More specifically, the recall function of a multi-answer character recognition based on BSB model was realized. The robustness of the proposed BSB circuit was analyzed and evaluated based on massive Monte-Carlo simulations, considering input defects, process variations, and electrical fluctuations. The physical constraints when implementing a neural network with memristor crossbar array have also been discussed. Our results show that the BSB circuit has a high tolerance to random noise. Comparably, the correlations between memristor arrays introduce directional noise and hence dominate the quality of the circuit.","",""

In this paper, we derive two modified RLS algorithms to tackle this problem. In the first algorithm, namely, the true weight decay RLS (TWDRLS) algorithm, we consider a modified energy function whereby the weight decay effect remains constant, irrespective of the number of learning epochs.
