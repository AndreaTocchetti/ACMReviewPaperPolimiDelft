While robust control methods provide rigorous guarantees on system stability under certain worst-case disturbances, they often result in simple controllers that perform poorly in the average (non-worst) case. In contrast, nonlinear control methods trained using deep learning have achieved state-of-the-art performance on many control tasks, but often lack robustness guarantees. We propose a technique that combines the strengths of these two approaches: a generic nonlinear control policy class, parameterized by neural networks, that nonetheless enforces the same provable robustness criteria as robust control. Specifically, we show that by integrating custom convex-optimization-based projection layers into a nonlinear policy, we can construct a provably robust neural network policy class that outperforms robust control methods in the average (non-adversarial) setting. We demonstrate the power of this approach on several domains, improving in performance over existing robust control methods and in stability over (non-robust) RL methods.","",""

Traditional ARA controllers need the availability of a high-precision model to avoid high control chattering. Furthermore, in practical applications of aerial object manipulation, the payloads that ARAs can handle vary, depending on the nature of the task. The high uncertainties due to modeling errors and an unknown payload are inversely proportional to the stability of ARAs. To address the issue of stability, a new adaptive robust controller, based on the Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural network, is proposed. A three-tier approach is also followed. Firstly, a detailed new model for the ARA is derived using the Lagrange–d'Alembert principle. Secondly, an adaptive robust controller, based on a sliding mode, is designed to manipulate the problem of uncertainties, including modeling errors. Last, a higher stability controller, based on the RBF neural network, is implemented with the adaptive robust controller to stabilize the ARAs, avoiding modeling errors and unknown payload issues. The novelty of the proposed design is that it takes into account high nonlinearities, coupling control loops, high modeling errors, and disturbances due to payloads and environmental conditions. The model was evaluated by the simulation of a case study that includes the two proposed controllers and ARA trajectory tracking. The simulation results show the validation and notability of the presented control algorithm.","",""

The presented robust MPC scheme constitutes a one-layer approach that unifies the often separated planning and control layers, by directly computing the control command based on a reference and possibly obstacle positions.

Because of the novality of Chebyshev Neural Networks (CNNs), that it requires much less computation time as compare to multi layer neural network (MLNN), is preferred to approximate the unknown system functions. By means of linear matrix inequalities, a sufficient condition is derived to ensure the asymptotic stability such that the sliding mode dynamics is restricted to the defined sliding surface.

Furthermore, a high gain observer is designed to provide an estimate for error dynamics. A linear in parameter neural network based adaptive signal is used to approximate and eliminate the effect of uncertainties due to link flexibilities and vibration modes on tracking performance, where the adaptation rule for the neural network weights is derived based on Lyapunov function. The stability and the ultimate boundedness of the error signals and closed-loop system is demonstrated through the Lyapunov stability theory.

Previous empirical results suggest that adversarial training requires wider networks for better performances. However, it remains elusive how does neural network width affect model robustness. In this paper, we carefully examine the relationship between network width and model robustness. Specifically, we show that the model robustness is closely related to the tradeoff between natural accuracy and perturbation stability, which is controlled by the robust regularization parameter λ. With the same λ, wider networks can achieve better natural accuracy but worse perturbation stability, leading to a potentially worse overall model robustness. To understand the origin of this phenomenon, we further relate the perturbation stability with the network’s local Lipschitzness. By leveraging recent results on neural tangent kernels, we theoretically show that wider networks tend to have worse perturbation stability. Our analyses suggest that: 1) the common strategy of first fine-tuning λ on small networks and then directly use it for wide model training could lead to deteriorated model robustness; 2) one needs to properly enlarge λ to unleash the robustness potential of wider models fully. Finally, we propose a new Width Adjusted Regularization (WAR) method that adaptively enlarges λ on wide models and significantly saves the tuning time.","",""

In this paper, we theoretically and empirically show that with just more unlabeled data, we can learn a model with better adversarially robust generalization. The key insight of our results is based on a risk decomposition theorem, in which the expected robust risk is separated into two parts: the stability part which measures the prediction stability in the presence of perturbations, and the accuracy part which evaluates the standard classification accuracy. As the stability part does not depend on any label information, we can optimize this part using unlabeled data. We further prove that for a specific Gaussian mixture problem illustrated by [35], adversarially robust generalization can be almost as easy as the standard generalization in supervised learning if a sufficiently large amount of unlabeled data is provided.

Simulation results demonstrated that PID sliding surface provided faster response than that of traditional PD-manifold controller. In this paper, a robust neural network global sliding mode PID-controller is proposed to control a robot manipulator with parameter variations and external disturbances. The chattering phenomenon is eliminated by substituting a single-input radial-basis-function (RBF) neural network. Moreover, a theoretical proof of the stability and the convergence of the proposed scheme are provided.","",""

In the DSNFN, a five-layer neural-fuzzy network (NFN) is used to model complex processes and compensate for structured and unstructured uncertainties. However, it is difficult to find a suitable-sized NFN to achieve the required approximation error. To deal with the mentioned problem, the number of rule nodes in the DSNFN can be either increased or decreased over time based on the tracking errors, and the adaptation laws in the sense of a projection algorithm are derived for tuning all parameters of the parameterized NFN. Using DSNFN, good tracking performance could be achieved in the system. Furthermore, the trained network avoids the problems of overfitting and underfitting. The global stability and the robustness of the overall control scheme are guaranteed, and the tracking errors converge to the required precision by the Lyapunov synthesis approach. Experiments performed on a two-link robot manipulator demonstrate the effectiveness of our scheme.","",""
