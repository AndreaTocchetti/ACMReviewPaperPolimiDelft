The maximization of both power density (PD) and the percentage of chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal were considered as the enhancement in the cell's performance. Three main parameters in terms of performance as well as commercialization are the system's inputs; the Pt which takes the range of 0.1‐0.5 mg/cm2, the degree of sulphonation in sulfonated‐poly‐ether‐ether‐ketone that changes in the range of 20‐80%, and the rate of aeration of cathode which varies between 10 and 150 mL/min. From the experimental dataset, two robust adaptive neuro‐fuzzy inference system models based on the fuzzy logic technique have been constructed. The comparisons between the models' outputs and the experimental data showed well‐fitting in both training and testing datasets. The mean squared errors of the PD model, for testing and whole datasets, were found 2.575 and 0.909 while for the COD model it showed 19.242 and 6.791, respectively. Then, based on the two fuzzy models, a Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm has been used to determine the best parameters that maximize both of the PD and the COD removal of the cell. The optimization process was utilized for single and multi‐object optimization processes. In the single optimization, the resulting maximums of the PD and the COD removal were found 62.844 (mW/m2) and 99.99 (%), respectively. Whereas, in the multi‐object optimization, the values of 61.787 (mW/m2) and 96.21 (%) were reached as the maximums for the PD and COD, respectively. This implies that, in both cases of optimization processes, the adopted methodology can efficiently enhance the microbial fuel cell performances than the previous work.","",""

Similarly the active and reactive powers tracking is smooth with the proposed control system, while with SMC method the reactive power oscillates on both sides of the reference and it reaches 0.01 kVAR on positive side and −0.01kVAR on the negative side of the plot.Under parameters variation, system with FFORC control scheme offers minimum steady state error which is about 0.01 radian/s, while in case of SMC with saturation function a peak value of 0.6 radian/s is recorded.

It is considered a prerequisite for the determination of cell phenotype, nuclear morphometrics, cell classification, and the grading and prognosis of cancer. However, it is a very challenging task because of the different types of nuclei, large intraclass variations, and diverse cell morphologies. Consequently, the manual inspection of such images under high-resolution microscopes is tedious and time-consuming. Alternatively, artificial intelligence (AI)-based automated techniques, which are fast and robust, and require less human effort, can be used. Recently, several AI-based nuclear segmentation techniques have been proposed. They have shown a significant performance improvement for this task, but there is room for further improvement. Thus, we propose an AI-based nuclear segmentation technique in which we adopt a new nuclear segmentation network empowered by residual skip connections to address this issue.

However, most AI algorithms are trained on a specific input domain (e.g., scanner vendor or hospital-tailored imaging protocol) and lack the robustness to perform optimally when applied to CMR data from other input domains.        To develop and validate a robust CMR analysis tool for automatic segmentation and cardiac function analysis which achieves state-of-the-art performance for multi-vendor short-axis cine CMR images.         The current work is an extension of our previously published quality-controlled AI-based tool for cine CMR analysis [1]. We deployed an AI algorithm that is equipped to handle different image sizes and domains automatically - the ‘nnU-Net’ framework [2] - and retrained our tool using the UK Biobank (UKBB) cohort population (n = 4,872) and a large database of clinical CMR studies obtained from two NHS hospitals (n = 3,406). The NHS hospital data came from three different scanner types: Siemens Aera 1.5T (n = 1,419), Philips Achieva 1.5T and 3T (n = 1,160), and Philips Ingenia 1.5T (n = 827). The ‘nnU-net’ was used to segment both ventricles and the myocardium. The proposed method was evaluated on randomly selected test sets from UKBB (n = 488) and NHS (n = 331) and on two external publicly available databases of clinical CMRs acquired on Philips, Siemens, General Electric (GE), and Canon CMR scanners – ACDC (n = 100) [3] and M&Ms (n = 321) [4]. We calculated the Dice scores - which measure the overlap between manual and automatic segmentations - and compared manual vs AI-based measures of biventricular volumes and function.          Table 1 shows that the Dice scores for the NHS, ACDC, and M&Ms scans are similar to those obtained in the highly controlled, single vendor and single field strength UKBB scans. Although our AI-based tool was only trained on CMR scans from two vendors (Philips and Siemens), it performs similarly in unseen vendors (GE and Canon). Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art performance in online segmentation challenges, without being specifically trained on these databases. Table 1 also shows good agreement between manual and automated clinical measures of ejection fraction and ventricular volume and mass.        We show that our proposed AI-based tool, which combines training on a large-scale multi-domain CMR database with a state-of-the-art AI algorithm, allows us to robustly deal with routine clinical data from multiple centres, vendors, and field strengths. This is a fundamental step for the clinical translation of AI algorithms. Moreover, our method yields a range of additional metrics of cardiac function (filling and ejection rates, regional wall motion, and strain) at no extra computational cost. ","",""

RECENT FINDINGS In the past few years, there has been a dramatic shift from machine learning approaches based on feature extraction to 'deep' convolutional neural networks for artificial intelligence applications. Several artificial intelligence for ROP approaches have demonstrated adequate proof-of-concept performance in research studies. The next steps are to determine whether these algorithms are robust to variable clinical and technical parameters in practice. Integration of artificial intelligence into ROP screening and treatment is limited by generalizability of the algorithms to maintain performance on unseen data and integration of artificial intelligence technology into new or existing clinical workflows.   SUMMARY Real-world implementation of artificial intelligence for ROP diagnosis will require massive efforts targeted at developing standards for data acquisition, true external validation, and demonstration of feasibility. We must now focus on ethical, technical, clinical, regulatory, and financial considerations to bring this technology to the infant bedside to realize the promise offered by this technology to reduce preventable blindness from ROP.","",""

Yet, the explosion of nonstandardized reporting of high-performing algorithms are rendered useless without robust and streamlined implementation guidelines. The development of protocols and checklists will accelerate the translation of research publications to impact on patient care.   RECENT FINDINGS Beyond technological scepticism, we lack uniformity in analysing algorithmic performance generalizability, and benchmarking impacts across clinical settings. No regulatory guardrails have been set to minimize bias or optimize interpretability; no consensus clinical acceptability thresholds or systematized postdeployment monitoring has been set. Moreover, stakeholders with misaligned incentives deepen the landscape complexity especially when it comes to the requisite data integration and harmonization to advance the field. Therefore, despite increasing algorithmic accuracy and commoditization, the infamous 'implementation gap' persists. Open clinical data repositories have been shown to rapidly accelerate research, minimize redundancies and disseminate the expertise and knowledge required to overcome existing barriers. Drawing upon the longstanding success of existing governance frameworks and robust data use and sharing agreements, the ophthalmic community has tremendous opportunity in ushering artificial intelligence into medicine. By collaboratively building a powerful resource of open, anonymized multimodal ophthalmic data, the next generation of clinicians can advance data-driven eye care in unprecedented ways.   SUMMARY This piece demonstrates that with readily accessible data, immense progress can be achieved clinically and methodologically to realize artificial intelligence's impact on clinical care. Exponentially progressive network effects can be seen by consolidating, curating and distributing data amongst both clinicians and data scientists.","",""

Therefore, in this work, hybrid feature selection-artificial intelligence-gravitational search algorithm (GSA) techniques were proposed to determine the fault type of power transformers based on DGA data. The artificial intelligence (AI) methods applied include support vector machine and artificial neural network. Both AI methods were optimised by GSA to enhance the accuracy of the results. Feature selections using stepwise regression and robust regression were applied to utilise only significant gases. The accuracy of the results was tested with various ratios of testing and training data. Comparison of the results using the proposed method with other optimisation methods and the previous works was performed to validate the performance of the proposed technique. It was observed that the proposed hybrid feature selection-AI-GSA technique yields reasonable accuracy although fewer types of dissolved gases were used.

Computing and understanding the properties of such sites is therefore a crucial component of the rational materials design process. Because of complex electronic effects at the atomic level, atomic site properties are conventionally derived from computationally expensive first-principle calculations, as this level of theory is required to achieve relevant accuracy. In this study, we present a widely applicable machine learning (ML) approach to compute atomic site properties with high accuracy in real time. The approach works well for complex non-crystalline atomic structures and therefore opens up the possibility for high-throughput screenings of nano-materials, amorphous systems and materials interfaces. Our approach includes a robust featurization scheme to transform atomic structures into features which can be used by common machine learning models. Performing a genetic algorithm (GA) based feature selection, we show how to establish an intuitive physical interpretation of the structure-property relations implied by the ML models. With this approach, we compute atomic site stabilities of metal nanoparticles ranging from 3-55 atoms with mean absolute errors in the range of 0.11-0.14 eV in real time. We also establish the chemical identity of the site as most important factor in determining atomic site stabilities, followed by structural features like bond distances and angles. Both, the featurization and GA feature selection functionality are published in open-source python modules. With this method, we enable the efficient rational design of highly specialized real-world nano-catalysts through data-driven materials screening.","",""

The AIBC layers have distinguished responsibilities and thus performance and robustness requirements. The upper layers need to follow a set of economic policies strictly and run on a deterministic and robust protocol. While the fundamental layer needs to follow a protocol with high throughput without sacrificing robustness. As such, the AIBC implements a two-consensus scheme to enforce economic policies and achieve performance and robustness: Delegated Proof of Economic Value (DPoEV) incentive consensus on the upper layers, and Delegated Adaptive Byzantine Fault Tolerance (DABFT) distributed consensus on the fundamental layer. The DPoEV uses the knowledge map algorithm to accurately assess the economic value of digital assets.

This paper seeks to utilize output feedback control for nonlinear system using artificial intelligence employing neural network. The Two Wheel Mobile Robot (TWMR) is treated as a multi-body dynamic system. The nonlinear swing-up problem is handled by designing an adaptive neural network, which is trained using a modified conventional controller called Linear Quadratic Optimal State Estimator with Integral Control (LQOSEIC). In this paper, the nonlinear system TWMR is stabilized utilizing a robust output feedback control called LQOSEIC. This controller allows a linearized model to emulate a model reference for the original nonlinear system. However, it works for a limited range of operations and will fail if the plant characteristics are unknown or uncertain. An adaptive neural network is used to overcome this problem. The adaptive neural controller is trained offline using LQOSEIC to obtain the initial weights of neurons for the network's hidden layers. After finishing the training, the LQOSEIC will be replaced by the adaptive neural controller. The main advantage of a neuro-controller is its ability to update the weights online depending on the error signal. If there are any disturbances or uncertainties that arises within the concerned nonlinear system, the neuro-controller will be able to handle it because of online learning that compensates for the effect of unpredictable conditions. The proposed adaptive neural network improves control performance and ensures the robust stability of the closed-loop control system. Finally, numerical simulations are used to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed controllers.","",""

The principle conclusion of these experiments was that VEGA provided a powerful and robust search technique for complex multiobjective optimization problems of high order when little or no a priori knowledge was available to guide the search. These results were similar to those found by previous researchers using scalar genetic algorithms for scalar optimization problems.  The VEGA technique was then applied to multiclass pattern discrimination tasks.

The experiments revealed that LS-2 was able to evolve high performance production system programs to perform the pattern discrimination tasks it was given. In addition, experiments which varied several of the parameters of LS-2 revealed something of the sensitivity of vector-valued genetic search to the settings of these parameters.

However, ABC can sometimes be slow to converge. In order to improve the algorithm performance, we present a modified method for solution update of the onlooker bees in this paper. In our method, the best feasible solutions found so far are shared globally among the entire population. Thus, the new candidate solutions are more likely to be close to the current best solution. In other words, we bias the solution direction toward the best-so-far position. Moreover, in each iteration, we adjust the radius of the search for new candidates using a larger radius earlier in the search process and then reduce the radius as the process comes closer to converging. Finally, we use a more robust calculation to determine and compare the quality of alternative solutions. We empirically assess the performance of our proposed method on two sets of problems: numerical benchmark functions and image registration applications. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is able to produce higher quality solutions with faster convergence than either the original ABC or the current state-of-the-art ABC-based algorithm. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

If many moving objects exist in the image, however, we obtain multiple measurements. Therefore, precise data association is necessary in order to track multiple objects correctly.

Although some works boast superior capabilities compared to clinicians, actual deployments of AI systems in the clinic are scarce. We describe four important gaps on the machine-learning side responsible for this discrepancy by first formulating them in a way that is actionable by AI researchers and then systematically addressing these needs. Aiming beyond the search for better model architectures or improved accuracy, we focus directly on the challenges of clinical usefulness as stated by medical professionals in the literature. Our results show that deep-learning systems can be robust, trustworthy, explainable, and transparent while retaining the superior level of performance these algorithms are known for. Despite their great promise, artificial intelligence (AI) systems have yet to become ubiquitous in the daily practice of medicine largely due to several crucial unmet needs of healthcare practitioners. These include lack of explanations in clinically meaningful terms, handling the presence of unknown medical conditions, and transparency regarding the system’s limitations, both in terms of statistical performance as well as recognizing situations for which the system’s predictions are irrelevant. We articulate these unmet clinical needs as machine-learning (ML) problems and systematically address them with cutting-edge ML techniques. We focus on electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis as an example domain in which AI has great potential and tackle two challenging tasks: the detection of a heterogeneous mix of known and unknown arrhythmias from ECG and the identification of underlying cardio-pathology from segments annotated as normal sinus rhythm recorded in patients with an intermittent arrhythmia. We validate our methods by simulating a screening for arrhythmias in a large-scale population while adhering to statistical significance requirements. Specifically, our system 1) visualizes the relative importance of each part of an ECG segment for the final model decision; 2) upholds specified statistical constraints on its out-of-sample performance and provides uncertainty estimation for its predictions; 3) handles inputs containing unknown rhythm types; and 4) handles data from unseen patients while also flagging cases in which the model’s outputs are not usable for a specific patient.

Current deep learning (DL)-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) models have a bias in the training stage of segmentation because only one set of ground truth (GT) annotations are evaluated. We propose a robust and stable inter-variability analysis of CT lung segmentation in COVID-19 to avoid the effect of bias. Methodology: The proposed inter-variability study consists of two GT tracers for lung segmentation on chest CT. Three AI models, PSP Net, VGG-SegNet, and ResNet-SegNet, were trained using GT annotations. We hypothesized that if AI models are trained on the GT tracings from multiple experience levels, and if the AI performance on the test data between these AI models is within the 5% range, one can consider such an AI model robust and unbiased. The K5 protocol (training to testing: 80%:20%) was adapted. Ten kinds of metrics were used for performance evaluation. Results: The database consisted of 5000 CT chest images from 72 COVID-19-infected patients. By computing the coefficient of correlations (CC) between the output of the two AI models trained corresponding to the two GT tracers, computing their differences in their CC, and repeating the process for all three AI-models, we show the differences as 0%, 0.51%, and 2.04% (all < 5%), thereby validating the hypothesis.

Nowadays, the smart speech emotion recognition (SER) system is a basic necessity and an emerging research area of digital audio signal processing. However, SER plays an important role with many applications that are related to human–computer interactions (HCI). The existing state-of-the-art SER system has a quite low prediction performance, which needs improvement in order to make it feasible for the real-time commercial applications. The key reason for the low accuracy and the poor prediction rate is the scarceness of the data and a model configuration, which is the most challenging task to build a robust machine learning technique. In this paper, we addressed the limitations of the existing SER systems and proposed a unique artificial intelligence (AI) based system structure for the SER that utilizes the hierarchical blocks of the convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) with sequence learning. We designed four blocks of ConvLSTM, which is called the local features learning block (LFLB), in order to extract the local emotional features in a hierarchical correlation. The ConvLSTM layers are adopted for input-to-state and state-to-state transition in order to extract the spatial cues by utilizing the convolution operations. We placed four LFLBs in order to extract the spatiotemporal cues in the hierarchical correlational form speech signals using the residual learning strategy. Furthermore, we utilized a novel sequence learning strategy in order to extract the global information and adaptively adjust the relevant global feature weights according to the correlation of the input features. Finally, we used the center loss function with the softmax loss in order to produce the probability of the classes. The center loss increases the final classification results and ensures an accurate prediction as well as shows a conspicuous role in the whole proposed SER scheme.

In a GPS/Inertial Navigation System (INS) tightly integration system, the GPS receiver’s carrier phase lock loops (PLLs) are aided by the Doppler shift from the INS, which can reduce user most dynamics. So the noise bandwidth can be narrowed to decrease the thermal noise tracking errors. However, due to the inertial sensor errors, the external INS-derived Doppler shift information are not completely accurate, therefore a Doppler-aiding error-induced phase error source must exist. The part of tracking error is derived in this paper. Other error sources are still present, so the bandwidth of PLLs cannot be set arbitrarily. This paper applies one artificial intelligence technique, the fuzzy logic controller (FLC), to calculate the PLL noise bandwidth on-line.

Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have demonstrated unprecedented performance across various fields such as medical diagnosis and autonomous driving. While DNNs are widely employed in security-sensitive fields, they are identified to be vulnerable to Neural Trojan (NT) attacks that are controlled and activated by the stealthy trigger. We call this vulnerable model as adversarial artificial intelligence (AI). In this paper, we target to design a robust Trojan detection scheme that inspects whether a pre-trained AI model has been Trojaned before its deployment. Prior works are oblivious of the intrinsic property of trigger distribution and try to reconstruct the trigger pattern using simple heuristics, i.e., stimulating the given model to incorrect outputs. As a result, their detection time and effectiveness are limited. We leverage the observation that the pixel trigger typically features spatial dependency and propose TAD, the first trigger approximation based Trojan detection framework that enables fast and scalable search of the trigger in the input space. Furthermore, TAD can also detect Trojans embedded in the feature space where certain filter transformations are used to activate the Trojan. We perform extensive experiments to investigate the performance of the TAD across various datasets and ML models.

Deep knowledge of their performance is needed for various strategic, tactical and operational decisions that rely on large amounts of data. To overcome the limitations of traditional analytical methods, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been lately used to deal with various types of signals and problems to be solved. However, the reliability of AI models depends largely on the quality of the signals and on the sensing modalities used. Multimodal sensing was found to be suitable in developing AI models able to learn time and location-related data dependencies. For many reasons, such as the uncertainty of preserving the sensing location and the inter- and intra-variability of operational conditions and work behavior, the approach is particularly useful for monitoring motor-manual operations. The main aim of this study was to check if the use of acceleration data sensed at two locations on a brush cutter could provide a robust AI model characterized by invariance to data sensing location. As such, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) with backpropagation was developed and used to learn and classify operational events from bimodally-collected acceleration data. The data needed for training and testing was collected in the central part of Romania. Data collection modalities were treated by fusion in the training dataset, then four single-modality testing datasets were used to check the performance of the model on a binary classification problem. Fine tuning of the regularization parameters (α term) has led to acceptable testing and generalization errors of the model measured as the binary cross-entropy (log loss). Irrespective of the hyperparameters’ tunning strategy, the classification accuracy (CA) was found to be very high, in many cases approaching 100%. However, the best models were those characterized by α set at 0.0001 and 0.1, for which the CA in the test datasets ranged from 99.1% to 99.9% and from 99.5% to 99.9%, respectively. Hence, data fusion in the training set was found to be a good strategy to build a robust model, able to deal with data collected by single modalities. As such, the developed MLP model not only removes the problem of sensor placement in such applications, but also automatically classifies the events in the time domain, enabling the integration of data collection, handling and analysis in a simple less resource-demanding workflow, and making it a feasible alternative to the traditional approach to the problem.","",""

These uncertainties contaminate IRA outputs, crucially impacting the navigation performance of low-grade IRA sensors in particular.

The immune system indicates the stochastic parameters of the ACO, which conducts the mutation process in one step for the purpose of computational efficiency. The ant mutation then moves particles into the most desirable position using parameters from the immune system to obtain optimal particle diversity.

During the training process, it is important to measure the performance of these operators according to different factors that can help to decide what operators are more suitable for different kinds of missions creating operator profiles. Having this goal in mind, this work aims to present an extensive and robust methodology to automatically extract different performance profiles from the training process of operators in an UAV simulation environment.

Measurements from a set of two rechargeable Li‐ion batteries are considered for the model performance evaluation. The battery capacity estimation by different models has been evaluated by considering the effect of certain parameters such as model complexity, sampling rate of battery measurable signals and type of battery measurable signals. With its ability to process time‐series data efficiently by memorizing long‐term dependencies, LSTM outperforms other model architectures in estimating battery capacity more accurately and flexibly with 4.69% and 19.16% decline in average test root mean square error (RMSE) as compared with FNN and CNN, respectively. Simpler architectures of LSTM and FNN are able to perform well as compared with CNN, which needs architecture with certain hidden layers to interpret the battery aging process.

Although there are concerns of map overfitting in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), cross-validation is rarely used. The problem is that establishing a performance metric of the maps over unseen data (given by 2D-projection images) is difficult due to the low signal-to-noise ratios in the individual particles. Here, I present recent advances for cryo-EM map reconstruction. I highlight that the gold-standard procedure can fail to detect map overfitting in certain cases, showing the necessity of assessing the map quality on unbiased data. Finally, I describe the challenges and advantages of developing a robust cross-validation methodology for cryo-EM.","",""

Classical solutions to the problem primarily aim at localisation and reconstruction of a geometric 3D model of the scene. More recently, the community increasingly investigates the development of Spatial Artificial Intelligence (Spatial AI), an evolutionary paradigm pursuing a simultaneous recovery of object-level composition and semantic annotations of the recovered 3D model. Several interesting approaches have already been presented, producing object-level maps with both geometric and semantic properties rather than just accurate and robust localisation performance. As such, they require much broader ground truth information for validation purposes. We discuss the structure of the representations and optimisation problems involved in Spatial AI, and propose new synthetic datasets that, for the first time, include accurate ground truth information about the scene composition as well as individual object shapes and poses. We furthermore propose evaluation metrics for all aspects of such joint geometric-semantic representations and apply them to a new semantic SLAM framework. It is our hope that the introduction of these datasets and proper evaluation metrics will be instrumental in the evaluation of current and future Spatial AI systems and as such contribute substantially to the overall research progress on this important topic.","",""

In this study, based on an embedded feature selection model, we construct a stacked deep structure for feature selection in a layer-by-layer manner. Its promising performance is guaranteed by the stacked generalized principle that random projections added into the original features can help us to continuously open the manifold structure existing in the original feature space in a stacked way. With such benefits, the original input feature space becomes more linearly separable. We use the epilepsy EEG data provided by the University of Bonn to evaluate our model. Based on the EEG data, we construct three classification tasks. On each task, we use different feature selection models to select features and then use two classifiers to perform classification based on the selected features. Our experimental results show that features selected by our new structure are more meaningful and helpful to the classifier hence generates better performance than benchmarking models.","",""

The presence of uncertainties further makes their control an extremely difficult task. So, the speed control strategy should be adaptive and robust for successful industrial applications. The conventional proportional integral derivative (PID) controller used to control the speed of the drive are tuned mainly using Ziegler-Nichols' (ZN) tuning technique. Since PID controller works well under the linear operating condition and underperforms when nonlinearity arises; Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques are being implemented to achieve better performance i.e. Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) and Modified Particle Swarm Optimization (MPSO). As per literature survey, not much work on MOGA & MPSO based techniques in performance analysis of PMSM drive has been reported. This paper proposes the novel design of MOGA and MPSO-AI techniques based PID speed controller which has been incorporated in PMSM drive to improve its dynamic performance. A model of PMSM drive is simulated under various operating conditions viz. Starting, load application and removal, speed reversal, to analyze its performance in terms of transient response specifications. The results obtained give the much better performance as compared to conventionally used ZN technique which is helpful in deciding the selection of said drive for a particular industrial application.","",""

Therefore, improving the robustness of these models to hardware-induced faults (such as soft errors, aging, and manufacturing defects) is of significant importance to avoid any disastrous event. Traditional redundancy-based fault mitigation techniques cannot be employed in a wide of applications due to their high overheads, which, when coupled with the compute-intensive nature of DNNs, lead to undesirable resource consumption.

At present, robot manipulators are used in unknown and unstructured situation and caused to provide complicated systems, consequently strong mathematical tools are used in new control methodologies to design nonlinear robust controller with satisfactory performance (e.g., minimum error, good trajectory, disturbance rejection). Robotic systems controlling is vital due to the wide range of application. Obviously stability and robustness are the most minimum requirements in control systems; even though the proof of stability and robustness is more important especially in the case of nonlinear systems. The strategies of robotic manipulators control are classified into two main groups: classical and non-classical methods, where the conventional control theory uses the classical method and the artificial intelligence theory (e.g., fuzzy logic, neural network, and neuro fuzzy) uses the non-classical methods. However both of classical and non-classical theories have applied successfully in many applications, but they also have some limitations. One of the best nonlinear robust controllers which can be used in uncertainty nonlinear systems is sliding mode controller (SMC). Sliding mode controller has two most important challenges: chattering phenomenon and nonlinear dynamic equivalent part.
