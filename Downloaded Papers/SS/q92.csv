A limited dataset of 921 images were photographed in different contexts and divided into 80:20 ratio for training and validation, respectively. The “You only look once” (YoloV3) CNN-based architecture was adopted for training the neural network. The Adam gradient descent optimizer algorithm was used to iteratively minimize the generalized intersection-over-union loss function. Knots on the surface of wood were manually annotated. Images and annotations were analyzed by a stack of convolutional and fully connected layers with skipped connections. After training, model checkpoint was created and inferences on the validation set were made. The quality of results was assessed by several metrics: precision, recall, F1-score, average precision, and precision x recall curve. Results indicated that YoloV3 provided knot detection time of approximately 0.0102 s per knot with a relatively low false positive and false negative ratios. Precision, recall, f1-score metrics reached 0.77, 0.79, and 0.78, respectively. The average precision was 80%. With an adequate number of images, it is possible to improve this tool for use within sawmills in the forms of both workstation and mobile device applications.","",""

State-ofthe-art DNNs misclassify adversarial input and give high confidence output for out-of-distribution input. We attempt to solve this problem by employing two approaches, first, by detecting adversarial input and, second, by developing a confidence metric that can indicate when a DNN system has reached its limits and is not performing to the desired specifications. The effectiveness of our method at detecting adversarial input is demonstrated against the popular DeepFool adversarial image generation method. On a benchmark of 50,000 randomly chosen ImageNet adversarial images generated for CaffeNet and GoogLeNet DNNs, our method can recover the correct label with 95.76% and 97.43% accuracy, respectively. The proposed attribution-based confidence (ABC) metric utilizes attributions used to explain DNN output to characterize whether an output corresponding to an input to the DNN can be trusted. The attribution based approach removes the need to store training or test data or to train an ensemble of models to obtain confidence scores. Hence, the ABC metric can be used when only the trained DNN is available during inference. We test the effectiveness of the ABC metric against both adversarial and out-of-distribution input. We experimental demonstrate that the ABC metric is high for ImageNet input and low for adversarial input generated by FGSM, PGD, DeepFool, CW, and adversarial patch methods. For a DNN trained on MNIST images, ABC metric is high for in-distribution MNIST input and low for out-of-distribution Fashion-MNIST and notMNIST input.","",""

The development of such tools can add value as a diagnostic aid in the evaluation of tissue samples involved by lymphoma. A common diagnostic question is the determination of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) progression to accelerated CLL (aCLL) or transformation to diffuse large B‐cell lymphoma (Richter transformation; RT) in patients who develop progressive disease. The morphologic assessment of CLL, aCLL, and RT can be diagnostically challenging. Using established diagnostic criteria of CLL progression/transformation, we designed four artificial intelligence‐constructed biomarkers based on cytologic (nuclear size and nuclear intensity) and architectural (cellular density and cell to nearest‐neighbor distance) features. We analyzed the predictive value of implementing these biomarkers individually and then in an iterative sequential manner to distinguish tissue samples with CLL, aCLL, and RT. Our model, based on these four morphologic biomarker attributes, achieved a robust analytic accuracy. This study suggests that biomarkers identified using artificial intelligence‐based tools can be used to assist in the diagnostic evaluation of tissue samples from patients with CLL who develop aggressive disease features. © 2021 The Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

The present work evaluates the effectiveness of Nuru as an in-field diagnostic tool by comparing the diagnosis capability of Nuru to that of cassava experts (researchers trained on cassava pests and diseases), agricultural extension agents and farmers. Methods The diagnosis capability of Nuru and that of the assessed individuals was determined by inspecting cassava plants in-field and by using the cassava symptom recognition assessment tool (CaSRAT) to score images of cassava leaves. Results Nuru’s accuracy for symptom recognition when using six leaves (74 - 88%, depending on the condition) was similar to that of experts, 1.5-times higher than agricultural extension agents and two-times higher than farmers.

The evolving neural network even exceeds the human cognitive level. However, the accuracy of these structures depends to some extent on the accuracy of the training data. Some well-designed generated antagonistic disturbances are sufficient to deceive model when added to images. Such attacks cause the classifiers trained by the neural network to misidentify the object and thus completely fail. On the other hand, the various existing defensive methods that have been proposed suffer from two criticisms. The first thing that bears the brunt is unsatisfactory detection rate due to low robustness toward the adversarial sample. Second, the excessive dependence on the output of specific network structure layers hinders the emergence of universal schemes. In this paper, we propose the large margin cosine estimation (LMCE) detection scheme to overcome the above shortcomings, making the detection independent and universal. We illustrate the principle of our approach and demonstrate the significance and analysis of some important parameters. Moreover, we model various types of adversarial attacks and establish proposed defense mechanisms against them and evaluate our approach from different aspects. This method has been clearly validated on a range of standard datasets including MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN. The assessment strongly reflects the robustness and pervasive of this approach in the face of various white and semi-white box attacks.","",""

Yet, the explosion of nonstandardized reporting of high-performing algorithms are rendered useless without robust and streamlined implementation guidelines. The development of protocols and checklists will accelerate the translation of research publications to impact on patient care.   RECENT FINDINGS Beyond technological scepticism, we lack uniformity in analysing algorithmic performance generalizability, and benchmarking impacts across clinical settings. No regulatory guardrails have been set to minimize bias or optimize interpretability; no consensus clinical acceptability thresholds or systematized postdeployment monitoring has been set. Moreover, stakeholders with misaligned incentives deepen the landscape complexity especially when it comes to the requisite data integration and harmonization to advance the field. Therefore, despite increasing algorithmic accuracy and commoditization, the infamous 'implementation gap' persists. Open clinical data repositories have been shown to rapidly accelerate research, minimize redundancies and disseminate the expertise and knowledge required to overcome existing barriers. Drawing upon the longstanding success of existing governance frameworks and robust data use and sharing agreements, the ophthalmic community has tremendous opportunity in ushering artificial intelligence into medicine. By collaboratively building a powerful resource of open, anonymized multimodal ophthalmic data, the next generation of clinicians can advance data-driven eye care in unprecedented ways.

Computing and understanding the properties of such sites is therefore a crucial component of the rational materials design process. Because of complex electronic effects at the atomic level, atomic site properties are conventionally derived from computationally expensive first-principle calculations, as this level of theory is required to achieve relevant accuracy. In this study, we present a widely applicable machine learning (ML) approach to compute atomic site properties with high accuracy in real time. The approach works well for complex non-crystalline atomic structures and therefore opens up the possibility for high-throughput screenings of nano-materials, amorphous systems and materials interfaces. Our approach includes a robust featurization scheme to transform atomic structures into features which can be used by common machine learning models. Performing a genetic algorithm (GA) based feature selection, we show how to establish an intuitive physical interpretation of the structure-property relations implied by the ML models. With this approach, we compute atomic site stabilities of metal nanoparticles ranging from 3-55 atoms with mean absolute errors in the range of 0.11-0.14 eV in real time. We also establish the chemical identity of the site as most important factor in determining atomic site stabilities, followed by structural features like bond distances and angles. Both, the featurization and GA feature selection functionality are published in open-source python modules. With this method, we enable the efficient rational design of highly specialized real-world nano-catalysts through data-driven materials screening.","",""

In this study, functional network tool is used to develop a model to predict water saturation using petrophysical well logs as input data and the dean-stark measured water saturation as an output parameter. The data comprised of more than 200 well log points corresponding to available core data. The developed FN model was optimized by using several optimization algorithms such as differential evolution (DE), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMAES). FN model optimized with PSO found to be the most robust artificial intelligence (AI) model to predict water saturation in carbonate rocks. The results showed that the proposed model predicted the water saturation with an accuracy of 97% when related to the experimental core values. In this study in addition to the development of optimized FN model, an explicit empirical correlation is also extracted from the optimized FN model. To validate the proposed correlation, three most commonly applied water saturation models (Simandoux, Bardon and Pied model, Fertl and Hammack Model, Waxman-Smits, and Indonesian) from literature were selected and subjected to same well log data as the AI model to estimate water saturation. The estimated water saturation values for AI and other saturation models were then compared with experimental values of testing data and the results showed that AI model was able to predict water saturation with an error of less than 5% while the saturation models did the same with lesser accuracy of error up to 50%.

Four specific different machine learning (ML) classification algorithms are implemented to predict facies on an open dataset in the Panoma gas field in southwest Kansas, USA. The objective is improvement of facies classification accuracy with robust application of ML technique compared to previous published work on the same dataset. A total of 4,149 data samples are available for analysis with known facies from the core data where each sample point contains four or five measured properties (wire-line logs), and two derived geological properties (geological constraining variables). Facies classification is addressed with four well-known classification algorithm which are artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), decision trees and gaussian process classifier (GPC). High dimensionality, non-linear correlation and overlapping feature space of facies classes make the non-parametric method more suitable to handle complex datasets. Among the presented classifiers, ANN perform better relative to others on validation dataset. It is observed that our present approach of adding more input features, increasing number of training dataset and efficient implementation of algorithm have improved facies prediction accuracy significantly on a blind well.","",""

These ML programs must be both accurate and robust. Accuracy means the results must be trusted enough to substitute for the manual deduction process. Robustness is the magnitude to which the network can handle discrepancies within the images. One way to gauge the robustness is through the use of adversarial networks. Adversarial algorithms are trained using perturbations of the image to reduce the accuracy of an existing classification model. The greater degree of perturbations a model can withstand, the more robust it is. In this paper, comparisons of existing deep neural network models and the advancement of adversarial AI are explored. While there is some published research about AI and adversarial networks, very little discusses this particular utilization for overhead imagery. This paper focuses on overhead imagery, specifically that of ships. Using a public Kaggle dataset, we developed multiple models to detect ships in overhead imagery, specifically ResNet50, DenseNet201, and InceptionV3. The goal of the adversarial works is to manipulate an image so that its contents are misclassified. This paper focuses specifically on producing perturbations that can be recreated in the physical world. This serves to account for physical conditions, whether intentional or not, that could reduce accuracy within our network. While there are military applications for this specific research, the general findings can be applied to all AI overhead image classification topics.

The latter considers inputs of influential/causal factors and revisits every time to identify new trends related to those factors, thus providing a more robust forecast.

Attention mechanism originates from the study of human visual behavior, which has been widely used in various fields of artificial intelligence in recent years and has become an important part of neural network structure. Many attention mechanism-based trackers have gained improved performance in both accuracy and robustness. However, these trackers cannot suppress the influence of background information and distractors accurately and do not enhance the target object information, which limits the performance of these trackers. We propose new Siamese point attention (SPA) networks for robust visual tracking. SPA networks learn position attention and channel attention jointly on two branch information. To construct point attention, each point on the template feature is used to calculate the similarity on the search feature. The similarity calculation is based on the local information of the target object, which can reduce the influence of background, deformation, and rotation factors. We can obtain the region of interest by calculating the position attention from point attention. Position attention is integrated into the calculation of channel attention to reduce the influence of irrelevant areas. In addition, we also propose the object attention, and integrate it into the classification and regression module to further enhance the semantic information of the target object and improve the tracking accuracy. Extensive experiments are also conducted on five benchmark datasets. The experiment results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.","",""

In this paper, an optimized squeeze–excitation AdaBound dense network (SE-AB-DenseNet) is designed to emphasize the significant spatial–spectral features of HSI data. The dense network is combined with the AdaBound and squeeze–excitation modules to give lower computation costs and better classification performance. The AdaBound optimizer gives the proposed model the ability to improve its stability and enhance its classification accuracy by approximately 2%. Additionally, the cutout regularization technique is used for HSI spatial–spectral classification to overcome the problem of overfitting. The experiments were carried out on two commonly used hyperspectral datasets (Indian Pines and Salinas). The experiment results on the datasets show a competitive classification accuracy when compared with state-of-the-art methods with limited training samples. From the SE-AB-DenseNet with the cutout model, the overall accuracies for the Indian Pines and Salinas datasets were observed to be 99.37 and 99.78, respectively.","",""

Considering users’ privacy, model sharing-based federated learning (FL) that mi- grates model parameters but not private data from edge devices to a central cloud is particularly attractive for edge-intelligent networks. Due to multiple rounds of iterative updating of high-dimensional model parameters between base station (BS) and edge devices, the communication reliability is a critical issue of FL for edge-intelligent networks. We reveal the impacts of the errors generated during model broadcast and model aggregation via wireless channels caused by channel fading, interference and noise on the accuracy of FL, especially when there exists channel uncertainty. To alleviate the impacts, we propose a robust FL algorithm for edge-intelligent networks with channel uncertainty, which is formulated as a worst-case optimization problem with joint device selection and transceiver design.

In this work, we propose a novel beat-to-beat artifact detection algorithm, which performs pulse wave segmentation based on wavelet transform and then detects artifacts beat by beat based on the decision list. We verified our method on data acquired from different databases and compared with experts’ annotations. The segmentation algorithm achieved an accuracy of 96.13%.

The purpose of this study automatically and robustly determines that the optimal shipping route is based on artificial intelligence approaches. It is general that Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) are almost the most popular methods in route planning. These two heuristic-based optimization techniques benefit from their specific advantages when solving different optimization problems. In this paper, we proposed a hybrid heuristic scheme by integrating GA and PSO to improve the accuracy and robustness of shipping route planning in restricted waters. The experimental results about both synthetic and real-world problems have demonstrated that our proposed hybrid approach outperforms the existing schemes in terms of both accuracy and robustness, and the approach is helpful for optimizing maritime traffic network for the links of terminals.","",""

Compared to traditional card recognition, fingerprint recognition and iris recognition, face recognition has many advantages including non-contact interface, high concurrency, and user-friendly usage. It has high potential to be used in government, public facilities, security, e-commerce, retailing, education and many other fields. With the development of deep learning and the introduction of deep convolutional neural networks, the accuracy and speed of face recognition have made great strides. However, the results from different networks and models are very different with different system architecture. Furthermore, it could take significant amount of data storage space and data processing time for the face recognition system with video feed, if the system stores images and features of human faces. In this paper, facial features are extracted by merging and comparing multiple models, and then a deep neural network is constructed to train and construct the combined features. In this way, the advantages of multiple models can be combined to mention the recognition accuracy. After getting a model with high accuracy, we build a product model. The model will take a human face image and extract it into a vector. Then the distance between vectors are compared to determine if two faces on different picture belongs to the same person.

Although some works boast superior capabilities compared to clinicians, actual deployments of AI systems in the clinic are scarce. We describe four important gaps on the machine-learning side responsible for this discrepancy by first formulating them in a way that is actionable by AI researchers and then systematically addressing these needs. Aiming beyond the search for better model architectures or improved accuracy, we focus directly on the challenges of clinical usefulness as stated by medical professionals in the literature. Our results show that deep-learning systems can be robust, trustworthy, explainable, and transparent while retaining the superior level of performance these algorithms are known for. Despite their great promise, artificial intelligence (AI) systems have yet to become ubiquitous in the daily practice of medicine largely due to several crucial unmet needs of healthcare practitioners. These include lack of explanations in clinically meaningful terms, handling the presence of unknown medical conditions, and transparency regarding the system’s limitations, both in terms of statistical performance as well as recognizing situations for which the system’s predictions are irrelevant. We articulate these unmet clinical needs as machine-learning (ML) problems and systematically address them with cutting-edge ML techniques. We focus on electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis as an example domain in which AI has great potential and tackle two challenging tasks: the detection of a heterogeneous mix of known and unknown arrhythmias from ECG and the identification of underlying cardio-pathology from segments annotated as normal sinus rhythm recorded in patients with an intermittent arrhythmia. We validate our methods by simulating a screening for arrhythmias in a large-scale population while adhering to statistical significance requirements. Specifically, our system 1) visualizes the relative importance of each part of an ECG segment for the final model decision; 2) upholds specified statistical constraints on its out-of-sample performance and provides uncertainty estimation for its predictions; 3) handles inputs containing unknown rhythm types; and 4) handles data from unseen patients while also flagging cases in which the model’s outputs are not usable for a specific patient.

Nowadays, the smart speech emotion recognition (SER) system is a basic necessity and an emerging research area of digital audio signal processing. However, SER plays an important role with many applications that are related to human–computer interactions (HCI). The existing state-of-the-art SER system has a quite low prediction performance, which needs improvement in order to make it feasible for the real-time commercial applications. The key reason for the low accuracy and the poor prediction rate is the scarceness of the data and a model configuration, which is the most challenging task to build a robust machine learning technique. In this paper, we addressed the limitations of the existing SER systems and proposed a unique artificial intelligence (AI) based system structure for the SER that utilizes the hierarchical blocks of the convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) with sequence learning. We designed four blocks of ConvLSTM, which is called the local features learning block (LFLB), in order to extract the local emotional features in a hierarchical correlation. The ConvLSTM layers are adopted for input-to-state and state-to-state transition in order to extract the spatial cues by utilizing the convolution operations. We placed four LFLBs in order to extract the spatiotemporal cues in the hierarchical correlational form speech signals using the residual learning strategy. Furthermore, we utilized a novel sequence learning strategy in order to extract the global information and adaptively adjust the relevant global feature weights according to the correlation of the input features. Finally, we used the center loss function with the softmax loss in order to produce the probability of the classes. The center loss increases the final classification results and ensures an accurate prediction as well as shows a conspicuous role in the whole proposed SER scheme.

In crowdsourced annotation tasks we study the impact of different interpretability approaches on annotation accuracy and task time. We compare these quality metrics with classical XAI, automated quality metrics. Our results demonstrate that psychophysical experiments allow for robust quality assessment of transparency in machine learning. Interestingly the quality metrics computed without humans in the loop did not provide a consistent ranking of interpretability methods nor were they representative for how useful an explanation was for humans. These findings highlight the potential of methods from classical psychophysics for modern machine learning applications.

It is crucial to build these algorithms in a structured manner to ensure reproducibility and reliability. In this context, we used a dataset of breast ultrasound (US) images with 252 breast cancer and 253 benign cases to refine the CAD image analysis workflow. Various dataset preparations (i.e., pre-processing, and spatial augmentation) and machine learning algorithms were tested to establish the framework with the best performance in the detection and classification of breast lesions in US images. The efficacy of the proposed workflows was evaluated regarding accuracy, precision, specificity, and sensitivity. Abstract Automation of medical data analysis is an important topic in modern cancer diagnostics, aiming at robust and reproducible workflows. Therefore, we used a dataset of breast US images (252 malignant and 253 benign cases) to realize and compare different strategies for CAD support in lesion detection and classification. Eight different datasets (including pre-processed and spatially augmented images) were prepared, and machine learning algorithms (i.e., Viola–Jones; YOLOv3) were trained for lesion detection. The radiomics signature (RS) was derived from detection boxes and compared with RS derived from manually obtained segments. Finally, the classification model was established and evaluated concerning accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve. After training on a dataset including logarithmic derivatives of US images, we found that YOLOv3 obtains better results in breast lesion detection (IoU: 0.544 ± 0.081; LE: 0.171 ± 0.009) than the Viola–Jones framework (IoU: 0.399 ± 0.054; LE: 0.096 ± 0.016). Interestingly, our findings show that the classification model trained with RS derived from detection boxes and the model based on the RS derived from a gold standard manual segmentation are comparable (p-value = 0.071). Thus, deriving radiomics signatures from the detection box is a promising technique for building a breast lesion classification model, and may reduce the need for the lesion segmentation step in the future design of CAD systems.","",""

The network traffic of IoT devices can be analyzed using AI techniques. The Adversary Learning (AdLIoTLog) model is proposed using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with attention mechanism on sequences of network events in the network traffic. We define network events as a sequence of the time series packets of protocols captured in the log. We have considered different packets TCP packets, UDP packets, and HTTP packets in the network log to make the algorithm robust. The distributed IoT devices can collaborate to cripple our world which is extending to Internet of Intelligence. The time series packets are converted into structured data by removing noise and adding timestamps. The resulting data set is trained by RNN and can detect the node pairs collaborating with each other. We used the BLEU score to evaluate the model performance. Our results show that the predicting performance of the AdLIoTLog model trained by our method degrades by 3-4% in the presence of attack in comparison to the scenario when the network is not under attack. AdLIoTLog can detect adversaries because when adversaries are present the model gets duped by the collaborative events and therefore predicts the next event with a biased event rather than a benign event.

However, unknown attacks may also occur with the development of the network and the attack samples are difficult to collect, resulting in unbalanced sample categories. In this case, the previous intrusion detection methods have the problem of high false positive rates and low detection accuracy, which restricts the application of these methods in a real situation. In this article, we propose a novel method based on deep neural networks to tackle the intrusion detection task, which is termed Cognitive Memory-guided AutoEncoder (CMAE). The CMAE method leverages a memory module to enhance the ability to store normal feature patterns while inheriting the advantages of autoencoder. Therefore, it is robust to the imbalanced samples. Besides, using the reconstruction error as an evaluation criterion to detect attacks effectively detects unknown attacks. To obtain superior intrusion detection performance, we propose feature reconstruction loss and feature sparsity loss to constrain the proposed memory module, promoting the discriminative of memory items and the ability of representation for normal data. Compared to previous state-of-the-art methods, sufficient experimental results reveal that the proposed CMAE method achieves excellent performance and effectiveness for intrusion detection.","",""

Such systems need to create an empathic interaction with the users; therefore, it os required to include an Emotion Recognition (ER) framework which has to run, in near real-time, together with several other intelligent services. Most of the low-cost commercial robots, however, although more accessible by users and healthcare facilities, have to balance costs and effectiveness, resulting in under-performing hardware in terms of memory and processing unit. This aspect makes the design of the systems challenging, requiring a trade-off between the accuracy and the complexity of the adopted models. This paper proposes a compact and robust service for Assistive Robotics, called Lightweight EMotion recognitiON (LEMON), which uses image processing, Computer Vision and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms to recognize facial expressions. Specifically, the proposed DL model is based on Residual Convolutional Neural Networks with the combination of Dilated and Standard Convolution Layers. The first remarkable result is the few numbers (i.e., 1.6 Million) of parameters characterizing our model. In addition, Dilated Convolutions expand receptive fields exponentially with preserving resolution, less computation and memory cost to recognize the distinction among facial expressions by capturing the displacement of the pixels. Finally, to reduce the dying ReLU problem and improve the stability of the model, we apply an Exponential Linear Unit (ELU) activation function in the initial layers of the model. We have performed training and evaluation (via one- and five-fold cross validation) of the model with five datasets available in the community and one mixed dataset created by taking samples from all of them. With respect to the other approaches, our model achieves comparable results with a significant reduction in terms of the number of parameters.","",""

A large portion of the current research is devoted to the development of new network architectures to improve segmentation accuracy by using context-aware mechanisms. In this work, it is investigated whether or not the addition of contextual information from the brain anatomy in the form of white matter (WM), gray matter (GM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) masks and probability maps improves U-Net-based brain tumor segmentation. The BraTS2020 dataset was used to train and test two standard 3D U-Net (nnU-Net) models that, in addition to the conventional MR image modalities, used the anatomical contextual information as extra channels in the form of binary masks (CIM) or probability maps (CIP). For comparison, a baseline model (BLM) that only used the conventional MR image modalities was also trained. The impact of adding contextual information was investigated in terms of overall segmentation accuracy, model training time, domain generalization, and compensation for fewer MR modalities available for each subject. Median (mean) Dice scores of 90.2 (81.9), 90.2 (81.9), and 90.0 (82.1) were obtained on the official BraTS2020 validation dataset (125 subjects) for BLM, CIM, and CIP, respectively. Results show that there is no statistically significant difference when comparing Dice scores between the baseline model and the contextual information models (p > 0.05), even when comparing performances for high and low grade tumors independently. In a few low grade cases where improvement was seen, the number of false positives was reduced. Moreover, no improvements were found when considering model training time or domain generalization. Only in the case of compensation for fewer MR modalities available for each subject did the addition of anatomical contextual information significantly improve (p < 0.05) the segmentation of the whole tumor.

One of the most prominent innovations is the integration of physics-based data science for robust downhole measurements. This paper introduces a promising breakthrough in electromagnetism-based corrosion imaging using physics informed machine learning (PIML), tested and validated on the cross-sections of real metal casings/tubing with defects of various sizes, locations, and spacing.  Unlike existing electromagnetism-based inspection tools, where only circumferential average metal thickness is measured, this research investigates the artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted interpretation of a unique arrangement of electromagnetic (EM) sensors. This facilitates the development of a novel solution for through-tubing corrosion imaging that enhances defect detection with pixel-level accuracy. The developed framework incorporates a finite-difference time-domain (FDTD)-based EM forward solver and an artificial neural network (ANN), namely the long short-term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM-RNN). The ANN is trained using the results generated from the FDTD solver, which simulates sensor readings for different scenarios of defects.  The integration of the array EM-sensor responses and an ANN enabled generalizable and accurate measurements of metal loss percentage across various experimental defects. It also enabled the precise predictions of the defects’ aperture sizes, numbers, and locations in 360-degree coverage. Results were plotted in customized 2D heat-maps for any desired cross-section of the test casings. Further analysis of different techniques demonstrated that the LSTM-RNN could show higher precision and robustness compared to regular dense NNs, especially in the case of multiple defects. The LSTM-RNN is validated using additional data from simulated and experimental data. The results show reliable predictions even with limited training data. The model accurately predicted defects of larger and smaller sizes that were intentionally excluded from the training data to demonstrate generalizability. This highlights a major advance toward corrosion imaging behind tubing.  This novel technique paves the way for the use of similar concepts on other sensors in multiple barriers imaging. Further work includes improvement to the sensor package and ANNs by adding a third dimension to the imaging capabilities to produce 3D images of defects on casings.","",""

Thus, the establishment of an approach that relates these parameters to the final recovery factor (RFf) is vital. The main objective of this research work was to use a number of artificial intelligence models to develop robust predictive models based on experimental data and main parameters controlling the LSWF determined through sensitivity analysis and feature selection. The parameters include properties of oil, rock, injected brine, and connate water. Different operational parameters were considered to increase the model accuracy as well. After collecting the relevant data from 99 experimental studies reported in the literature, the database underwent a comprehensive and rigorous data preprocessing stage, which included removal of duplicates and low-variance features, missing value imputation, collinearity assessment, data characteristic assessment, outlier removal, feature selection, data splitting (80–20 rule was applied), and data scaling. Then, a number of methods such as linear regression (LR), multilayer perceptron (MLP), support vector machine (SVM), and committee machine intelligent system (CMIS) were used to link 1316 data samples assembled in this research work.

Recent research has shown that the accuracy of recommendations can be improved significantly by using matrix factorization (MF) models. In particular, a mixed MF model was used by BellKor's Pragmatic Chaos to win the Netflix Prize. On the other hand, system designers must also be concerned about system robustness - the ability of the system to provide good recommendations when the system database is contaminated with some portion of noisy or erroneous data, perhaps maliciously entered by `profile injection' attackers intent on distorting system recommendations. In this paper, we focus on the robustness of MF based CF algorithms (MFCF), which usually transform the prediction of user preferences on items into a least squares problem, solved by gradient descent. As least squares is known to be sensitive to outliers, it is not surprising that MF algorithms are vulnerable to attack. Nevertheless a number of `robust statistics' have been proposed since the 1960's that provide alternative data fitting strategies that are less sensitive to outliers. In particular, in this paper, we propose a least trimmed squares based MF (LTSMF) to help improve the robustness of the least squares based MF (LSMF) models. Least trimmed squares is shown to be more robust than least squares and another popular robust method - M-estimator.

It matches ‘randomised’ free induction decay acquisitions against pre‐computed simulated tissue responses to generate a set of quantitative images of T1, T2 and proton density (PD) with co‐registered voxels, rather than as traditional relative T1‐ and T2‐weighted images. MRF numeric pixel values retain accuracy and reproducibility between 2% and 8%. MRF acquisition is robust to strong undersampling of k‐space. Scan sequences have been optimised to suppress sub‐sampling artefacts, while artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques have been employed to increase matching speed and precision. MRF promises improved patient comfort with reduced scan times and fewer image artefacts. Quantitative MRF data could be used to define population‐wide numeric biomarkers that classify normal versus diseased tissue.

Numerous approaches have therefore been proposed to develop decision-making systems that are discrimination-conscious by-design, which are typically batch-based and require the simultaneous availability of all the training data for model learning. However, in the real-world, the data streams usually come on the fly which requires the model to process each input data once ""on arrival"" and without the need for storage and reprocessing. In addition, the data streams might also evolve over time, which further requires the model to be able to simultaneously adapt to non-stationary data distributions and time-evolving bias patterns, with an effective and robust trade-off between accuracy and fairness. In this paper, we propose a novel framework of online decision tree with fairness in the data stream with possible distribution drifting. Specifically, first, we propose two novel fairness splitting criteria that encode the data as well as possible, while simultaneously removing dependence on the sensitive attributes, and further adapts to non-stationary distribution with fine-grained control when needed.
