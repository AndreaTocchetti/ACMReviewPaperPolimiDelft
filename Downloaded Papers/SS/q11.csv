However, a single RGB camera may not be able to capture the actual object within the BB even if the CNN detector accuracy is high for the object. In this research, we present a solution to this limitation through the usage of multiple cameras, projective transformation, and a fuzzy logic–based fusion. The proposed algorithm generates a “confidence score” for each frame to check the trustworthiness of the BB generated by the CNN detector. As a first step toward this solution, we created a two-camera setup to detect objects. Agricultural weed is used as objects to be detected. A CNN detector generates BB for each camera when weed is present. Then a projective transformation is used to project one camera’s image plane to another camera’s image plane. The intersect over union (IOU) overlap of the BB is computed when objects are detected correctly. Four different scenarios are generated based on how far the object is from the multi-camera setup, and IOU overlap is calculated for each scenario (ground truth). When objects are detected correctly and bounding boxes are at correct distance, the IOU overlap value should be close to the ground truth IOU overlap value. On the other hand, the IOU overlap value should differ if BBs are at incorrect positions. Mamdani fuzzy rules are generated using this reasoning, and three different confidence scores (“high,” “ok,” and “low”) are given to each frame based on accuracy and position of BBs. The proposed algorithm was then tested under different conditions to check its validity. The confidence score of the proposed fuzzy system for three different scenarios supports the hypothesis that the multi-camera–based fusion algorithm improved the overall robustness of the detection system.","",""

This Input-Agnostic Sampling (IAS) scheme may yield a poor Average Certified Radius (ACR)-runtime trade-off which calls for improvement. In this paper, we propose Input-Specific Sampling (ISS) acceleration to achieve the cost-effectiveness for robustness certification, in an adaptive way of reducing the sampling size based on the input characteristic. Furthermore, our method universally controls the certified radius decline from the ISS sample size reduction. The empirical results on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet show that ISS can speed up the certification by more than three times at a limited cost of 0.05 certified radius. Meanwhile, ISS surpasses IAS on the average certified radius across the extensive hyperparameter settings. Specifically, ISS achieves ACR=0.958 on ImageNet in 250 minutes, compared to ACR=0.917 by IAS under the same condition.

In this work, we propose a distribution-aware pseudo labeling method (DAP-SDD) to detect small defects accurately while using limited labeled data effectively. Speciﬁcally, we apply bootstrapping on limited labeled data and then utilize the approximated label distribution to guide pseudo label propagation. Moreover, we propose to use the t-distribution conﬁdence interval for threshold setting to generate more pseudo labels with high conﬁdence.

A variety of methods have been developed that focus on these issues in isolation, however, managing these methods in conjunction with model development can be cumbersome and timeconsuming. In this paper, we introduce a unified and model-agnostic approach to address these issues: Counterfactual Explanations for Robustness, Transparency, Interpretability, and Fairness of Artificial Intelligence models (CERTIFAI). Unlike previous methods in this domain, CERTIFAI is a general tool that can be applied to any black-box model and any type of input data. Given a model and an input instance, CERTIFAI uses a custom genetic algorithm to generate counterfactuals: instances close to the input that change the prediction of the model. We demonstrate how these counterfactuals can be used to examine issues of robustness, interpretability, transparency, and fairness. Additionally, we introduce CERScore, the first black-box model robustness score that performs comparably to methods that have access to model internals.","",""

Objective The purpose of this study is to investigate the awareness of AI among Korean doctors and to assess physicians’ attitudes toward the medical application of AI. Methods We conducted an online survey composed of 11 closed-ended questions using Google Forms. The survey consisted of questions regarding the recognition of and attitudes toward AI, the development direction of AI in medicine, and the possible risks of using AI in the medical field. Results A total of 669 participants completed the survey. Only 40 (5.9%) answered that they had good familiarity with AI. However, most participants considered AI useful in the medical field (558/669, 83.4% agreement). The advantage of using AI was seen as the ability to analyze vast amounts of high-quality, clinically relevant data in real time. Respondents agreed that the area of medicine in which AI would be most useful is disease diagnosis (558/669, 83.4% agreement). One possible problem cited by the participants was that AI would not be able to assist in unexpected situations owing to inadequate information (196/669, 29.3%). Less than half of the participants(294/669, 43.9%) agreed that AI is diagnostically superior to human doctors. Only 237 (35.4%) answered that they agreed that AI could replace them in their jobs. Conclusions This study suggests that Korean doctors and medical students have favorable attitudes toward AI in the medical field.

To do that, data collected from the four-year daily measurements of the Chahnimeh#1 lake in Eastern Iran were used for developing the GAA and GP models and after that, the performance of the considered models are examined to predict the lake water levels of an adjacent lake namely Chahnimeh#4 as the non-observed information. The results showed that both model has the ability to simulate adjacent lakes using the considered lake water levels for the training procedure. In addition, another goal is to develop simple, practical formulation for predicting the lake water level, So that, using the GP method, as the superior model, three different formulations are proposed in order to predict the one, three, and five days ahead lake water level, respectively.","",""

Interns could voluntarily join the regular (no additional tutoring), expert-led tutoring, or expert-led+AI tutoring groups freely. In the regular group, interns (n=25) did not receive additional tutoring. The expert-led group received 3-hour expert-led tutoring and in-training formative assessments after 2 practice sessions. After a similar expert-led course, the expert-led+AI group (n=23) practiced and assessed their skills on an AI system. Through a comparison with the internal standard, the system automatically recorded and evaluated every intern’s suturing/ligature skills.

Such scores may enable clinicians to better use artificial intelligence (AI) tools.   Materials and Methods This retrospective study included 46 057 studies from seven ""internal"" centers for development (training, architecture selection, hyperparameter tuning, and operating-point calibration; n = 25 946) and evaluation (n = 2947) and three ""external"" centers for calibration (n = 400) and evaluation (n = 16  764). Internal centers contributed developmental data, whereas external centers did not. Deep neural networks predicted the presence of ICH and subtypes (intraparenchymal, intraventricular, subarachnoid, subdural, and/or epidural hemorrhage) and segmentations per case. Two ICH confidence scores are discussed: a calibrated classifier entropy score and a Dempster-Shafer score. Evaluation was completed by using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and report turnaround time (RTAT) modeling on the evaluation set and on confidence score-defined subsets using bootstrapping.   Results The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve for ICH were 0.97 (0.97, 0.98) and 0.95 (0.94, 0.95) on internal and external center data, respectively. On 80% of the data stratified by calibrated classifier and Dempster-Shafer scores, the system improved the Youden indexes, increasing them from 0.84 to 0.93 (calibrated classifier) and from 0.84 to 0.92 (Dempster-Shafer) for internal centers and increasing them from 0.78 to 0.88 (calibrated classifier) and from 0.78 to 0.89 (Dempster-Shafer) for external centers (P < .001).

There was no difference in detection of advanced adenomas between the two groups (mean number of advanced adenomas per colonoscopy 0.03 for each, high certainty). Mean number of adenomas per colonoscopy were higher for small adenomas (≤5 mm) with AI compared to non-AI colonoscopy (mean difference 0.15, [0.12-0.18]), but not for larger adenomas (>5-≤10mm: mean difference 0.03, [0.01-0.05]; >10 mm: mean difference 0.01, [0.00-0.02], high certainty). Data on cancer are unavailable.   CONCLUSIONS AI-based polyp detection systems during colonoscopy increase detection of small, non-advanced adenomas and polyps, but not advanced adenomas.","",""

We propose that explainable AI systems deliver accompanying evidence or reasons for outcomes and processes; provide explanations that are understandable to individual users; provide explanations that correctly reflect the system’s process for generating the output; and that a system only operates under conditions for which it was designed and when it reaches sufficient confidence in its output. We have termed these four principles as explanation, meaningful, explanation accuracy, and knowledge limits, respectively. Through significant stakeholder engagement, these four principles were developed to encompass the multidisciplinary nature of explainable AI, including the fields of computer science, engineering, and psychology. Because one-sizefits-all explanations do not exist, different users will require different types of explanations. We present five categories of explanation and summarize theories of explainable AI. We give an overview of the algorithms in the field that cover the major classes of explainable algorithms. As a baseline comparison, we assess how well explanations provided by people follow our four principles. This assessment provides insights to the challenges of designing explainable AI systems.","",""

Diagnostic performance was computed for a system trained on CXRs of Italian subjects from two hospitals in Lombardy, Italy. Methods We used for training and internal testing an ensemble of ten convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with mainly bedside CXRs of 250 COVID-19 and 250 non-COVID-19 subjects from two hospitals. We then tested such system on bedside CXRs of an independent group of 110 patients (74 COVID-19, 36 non COVID-19) from one of the two hospitals. A retrospective reading was performed by two radiologists in the absence of any clinical information, with the aim to differentiate COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 patients. Real-time polymerase chain reaction served as reference standard. Results At 10-fold cross-validation, our AI model classified COVID-19 and non COVID-19 patients with 0.78 sensitivity (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.74-0.81), 0.82 specificity (95% CI 0.78-0.85) and 0.89 area under the curve (AUC) (95% CI 0.86-0.91). For the independent dataset, AI showed 0.80 sensitivity (95% CI 0.72-0.86) (59/74), 0.81 specificity (29/36) (95% CI 0.73-0.87), and 0.81 AUC (95% CI 0.73-0.87). Radiologists reading obtained 0.63 sensitivity (95% CI 0.52-0.74) and 0.78 specificity (95% CI 0.61-0.90) in one centre and 0.64 sensitivity (95% CI 0.52-0.74) and 0.86 specificity (95% CI 0.71-0.95) in the other.

This may include the inability to fully explain how an algorithm works inherent to the black-box nature of the system. Additionally, AI/ML may create a potential for bias and artifacts that cannot be validated due to the same limitations. In a medical application, the lack of transparency in how the system operates may lead to a loss of trust by users. Bayesian approaches that use computational modeling to quantify the level of uncertainty in a given result may provide a path towards improved confidence and use. In this paper, evidence from studies in a range of medical applications is presented and discussed, showing how Bayesian approaches can help to foster trust. A retrospective study using a publicly available dataset explored the feasibility of creating predictive models for early intervention in a Type 1 diabetes population. Creating the perfect model was not the goal of the exercise, rather the study aimed to demonstrate how Bayesian methods could be used to identify areas of uncertainty during model development. Feature selection was based on analytical assessment of various patterns found in the data. Models were trained, validated, and tested, generating uncertainty estimates. A two-feature Gaussian Naïve Bayes (GNB) model, using the previous five minutes and ten minutes of blood glucose values, showed similar results for predictive accuracy as a threefeature model that included average change over the preceding 30 minutes. The two-feature model was selected because it allowed for a more easily understood visualization of uncertainty. The 2-feature GNB achieved an AUC = .94. The model showed good sensitivity for exceeding the < 180 mg/dl limit, obtaining threshold prediction = 89.8% and normal range prediction = 90.8%. The sensitivity was lower for the < 70 mg/dl limit, attaining a sensitivity = 77.5%. Posterior probabilities showed differing levels of uncertainty in the prediction of high and low out-of-range conditions. The model demonstrated the feasibility of providing robust parameter estimates. Bayesian machine learning approaches to model uncertainty may improve the transparency, explainability, and applicability of AI/ML in medical treatment, realizing the promise to improve patient safety and outcomes.","",""

However, health care has been relatively late to adopt them. This article provides clinical examples in which machine learning and artificial intelligence are already in use in health care and appear to deliver benefit. Three key bottlenecks toward increasing the pace of diffusion and adoption are methodological issues in evaluation of artificial intelligence-based interventions, reporting standards to enable assessment of model performance, and issues that need to be addressed for an institution to adopt these interventions. Methodological best practices will include external validation, ideally at a different site; use of proactive learning algorithms to correct for site-specific biases and increase robustness as algorithms are deployed across multiple sites; addressing subgroup performance; and communicating to providers the uncertainty of predictions. Regarding reporting, especially important issues are the extent to which implementing standardized approaches for introducing clinical decision support has been followed, describing the data sources, reporting on data assumptions, and addressing biases. Although most health care organizations in the United States have adopted electronic health records, they may be ill prepared to adopt machine learning and artificial intelligence. Several steps can enable this: preparing data, developing tools to get suggestions to clinicians in useful ways, and getting clinicians engaged in the process. Open challenges and the role of regulation in this area are briefly discussed. Although these techniques have enormous potential to improve care and personalize recommendations for individuals, the hype regarding them is tremendous. Organizations will need to approach this domain carefully with knowledgeable partners to obtain the hoped-for benefits and avoid failures.","",""

However, ligand RNA assays have not been adopted into routine practice due to issues with analytic precision and practicality. We investigated whether AREG/EREG IHC could predict benefit from the anti-EGFR agent panitumumab. Experimental Design: Artificial intelligence algorithms were developed to assess AREG/EREG IHC in 274 patients from the PICCOLO trial of irinotecan with or without panitumumab (Ir vs. IrPan) in RAS wild-type mCRC. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints were RECIST response rate (RR) and overall survival (OS). Models were repeated adjusting separately for BRAF mutation status and primary tumor location (PTL). Results: High ligand expression was associated with significant PFS benefit from IrPan compared with Ir [8.0 vs. 3.2 months; HR, 0.54; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.37–0.79; P = 0.001]; whereas low ligand expression was not (3.4 vs. 4.4 months; HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.74–1.49; P = 0.78). The ligand-treatment interaction was significant (Pinteraction = 0.02) and remained significant after adjustment for BRAF-mutation status and PTL. Likewise, RECIST RR was significantly improved in patients with high ligand expression (IrPan vs. Ir: 48% vs. 6%; P < 0.0001) but not those with low ligand expression (25% vs. 14%; P = 0.10; Pinteraction = 0.01).

In the 1990’s Winterstein proposed a cubic Hermite transformation using skewness and kurtosis, which has been widely applied in many areas for its accuracy and robustness. However, this approach is valid for monotonic transformation and narrow-banded processes. When the bandwidth of a random process is wide, no reasonable methods are available for acquiring the extreme value. This paper therefore applies the artificial neural network and genetic algorithm to do the extreme value prediction, without seeking rigorous mathematical derivations. Not only skewness and kurtosis are used, the spectral moments up to 4th-order reflecting bandwidth effects are also adopted. The results of many random case studies show that the artificial intelligence method is more accurate than the Hermite method in most of situations, especially for non-monotonic transformations. Besides, the artificial intelligence method has a wider application range.","",""

Purpose To establish and evaluate an artificial intelligence (AI) system for differentiating COVID-19 and other pneumonia at chest CT and assessing radiologist performance without and with AI assistance. Materials and Methods A total of 521 patients with positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction results for COVID-19 and abnormal chest CT findings were retrospectively identified from 10 hospitals from January 2020 to April 2020. A total of 665 patients with non-COVID-19 pneumonia and definite evidence of pneumonia at chest CT were retrospectively selected from three hospitals between 2017 and 2019. To classify COVID-19 versus other pneumonia for each patient, abnormal CT slices were input into the EfficientNet B4 deep neural network architecture after lung segmentation, followed by a two-layer fully connected neural network to pool slices together. The final cohort of 1186 patients (132 583 CT slices) was divided into training, validation, and test sets in a 7:2:1 and equal ratio. Independent testing was performed by evaluating model performance in separate hospitals. Studies were blindly reviewed by six radiologists without and then with AI assistance. Results The final model achieved a test accuracy of 96% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 90%, 98%), a sensitivity of 95% (95% CI: 83%, 100%), and a specificity of 96% (95% CI: 88%, 99%) with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.95 and area under the precision-recall curve of 0.90.

Translation of these findings into the clinic is the logical next step. This translation can only be successful if patients' concerns and questions are addressed suitably. We therefore conducted a survey to evaluate the patients' view of artificial intelligence in melanoma diagnostics in Germany, with a particular focus on patients with a history of melanoma. Participants and Methods: A web-based questionnaire was designed using LimeSurvey, sent by e-mail to university hospitals and melanoma support groups and advertised on social media. The anonymous questionnaire evaluated patients' expectations and concerns toward artificial intelligence in general as well as their attitudes toward different application scenarios. Descriptive analysis was performed with expression of categorical variables as percentages and 95% confidence intervals. Statistical tests were performed to investigate associations between sociodemographic data and selected items of the questionnaire. Results: 298 individuals (154 with a melanoma diagnosis, 143 without) responded to the questionnaire. About 94% [95% CI = 0.91–0.97] of respondents supported the use of artificial intelligence in medical approaches. 88% [95% CI = 0.85–0.92] would even make their own health data anonymously available for the further development of AI-based applications in medicine. Only 41% [95% CI = 0.35–0.46] of respondents were amenable to the use of artificial intelligence as stand-alone system, 94% [95% CI = 0.92–0.97] to its use as assistance system for physicians. In sub-group analyses, only minor differences were detectable. Respondents with a previous history of melanoma were more amenable to the use of AI applications for early detection even at home. They would prefer an application scenario where physician and AI classify the lesions independently. With respect to AI-based applications in medicine, patients were concerned about insufficient data protection, impersonality and susceptibility to errors, but expected faster, more precise and unbiased diagnostics, less diagnostic errors and support for physicians. Conclusions: The vast majority of participants exhibited a positive attitude toward the use of artificial intelligence in melanoma diagnostics, especially as an assistance system.","",""

To achieve herd immunity, widespread administration of vaccines is required, which necessitates significant cooperation from the general public. As such, it is crucial that governments and public health agencies understand public sentiments toward vaccines, which can help guide educational campaigns and other targeted policy interventions. Objective The aim of this study was to develop and apply an artificial intelligence–based approach to analyze public sentiments on social media in the United Kingdom and the United States toward COVID-19 vaccines to better understand the public attitude and concerns regarding COVID-19 vaccines. Methods Over 300,000 social media posts related to COVID-19 vaccines were extracted, including 23,571 Facebook posts from the United Kingdom and 144,864 from the United States, along with 40,268 tweets from the United Kingdom and 98,385 from the United States from March 1 to November 22, 2020. We used natural language processing and deep learning–based techniques to predict average sentiments, sentiment trends, and topics of discussion. These factors were analyzed longitudinally and geospatially, and manual reading of randomly selected posts on points of interest helped identify underlying themes and validated insights from the analysis. Results Overall averaged positive, negative, and neutral sentiments were at 58%, 22%, and 17% in the United Kingdom, compared to 56%, 24%, and 18% in the United States, respectively. Public optimism over vaccine development, effectiveness, and trials as well as concerns over their safety, economic viability, and corporation control were identified. We compared our findings to those of nationwide surveys in both countries and found them to correlate broadly. Conclusions Artificial intelligence–enabled social media analysis should be considered for adoption by institutions and governments alongside surveys and other conventional methods of assessing public attitude. Such analyses could enable real-time assessment, at scale, of public confidence and trust in COVID-19 vaccines, help address the concerns of vaccine sceptics, and help develop more effective policies and communication strategies to maximize uptake.","",""

The results indicated that AI literacy was not predictive of AI readiness. The influences of AI literacy were mediated by the students’ confidence and perception of AI relevance. The students’ AI readiness was not influenced by a reduction in their anxiety regarding AI and an enhancement in their AI literacy. Male students reported a higher confidence, relevance, and readiness for AI than female students did. The sentiments reflected by the open-ended responses of the students indicated that the students were generally excited to learn about AI and viewed AI as a powerful and useful technology.

The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the uptake of advanced technology, and investment in AI continues to grow exponentially.AI also poses considerable risks and challenges to society which raises concerns about whether AI systems are worthy of trust. These concerns have been fuelled by high profile cases of AI use that were biased, discriminatory, manipulative, unlawful, or violated privacy or other human rights. Without public confidence that AI is being developed and used in an ethical and trustworthy manner, it will not be trusted and its full potential will not be realised. To echo the sentiment of Dr Alan Finkel AO, Australia’s Chief Scientist, acceptance of AI rests on “the essential foundation of trust”. Are we capable of extending our trust to AI?This national survey is the first to take a deep dive into answering this question and understanding community trust and expectations in relation to AI. To do this, we surveyed a nationally representative sample of over 2,500 Australian citizens in June to July 2020. Our findings provide important and timely research insights into the public’s trust and attitudes towards AI and lay out a pathway for strengthening trust and acceptance of AI systems.Key findings include:              - Trust is central to the acceptance of AI, and is influenced by four key drivers;              - Australians have low trust in AI systems but generally ‘accept’ or ‘tolerate’ AI;              - Australians expect AI to be regulated and carefully managed;              - Australians expect organisations to uphold the principles of trustworthy AI;              - Australians feel comfortable with some but not all uses of AI at work;              - Australians want to know more about AI but currently have low awareness and understanding of AI and its uses.We draw out the implications of the findings for government, business and NGOs and provide a roadmap to enhancing public trust in AI highlighting three key actions:              - Live up to Australian’s expectations of trustworthy AI              - Strengthen the regulatory framework for governing AI              - Strengthen Australia’s AI literacy","",""

METHODS A retrospective review was conducted of otoscopic images analysed using transfer learning with Google's Inception-V3 convolutional neural network architecture. The 'gold standard' 'ground truth' was defined by otolaryngologists. Perforation size was categorised as less than one-third (small), one-third to two-thirds (medium), or more than two-thirds (large) of the total tympanic membrane diameter.   RESULTS A total of 233 tympanic membrane images were used (183 for training, 50 for testing). The algorithm correctly identified intact and perforated tympanic membranes (overall accuracy = 76.0 per cent, 95 per cent confidence interval = 62.1-86.0 per cent); the area under the curve was 0.867 (95 per cent confidence interval = 0.771-0.963).   CONCLUSION A proof-of-concept image-classification artificial intelligence algorithm can be used to detect tympanic membrane perforations and, with further development, may prove to be a valuable tool for ear disease screening.

However, despite its importance, only a few studies have investigated how the explanations of an XAI system should be designed. This study investigates how people attribute the perceived ability of XAI systems based on perceived attributional qualities and how the power status of the XAI and anthropomorphism affect the attribution process. In a laboratory experiment, participants (N = 500) read a scenarios of using an XAI system with either lower or higher power status and reported their perceptions of the system. Results indicated that an XAI system with a higher power status caused users to perceive the outputs of the XAI system to be more controllable by intention, and higher perceived stability and uncontrollability resulted in greater confidence in the system’s ability. The effect of perceived controllability on perceived ability was moderated by the extent to which participants anthropomorphised the system. Several design implications for XAI systems are suggested based on our findings.","",""

However, high rates of image interpretation error mean that novel solutions such as artificial intelligence (AI) are being explored. Objectives To determine patient confidence in clinician-led radiograph interpretation, the perception of AI-assisted interpretation and management, and to identify factors which might influence these views. Methods A novel questionnaire was distributed to patients attending fracture clinic in a large inner-city teaching hospital. Categorical and Likert scale questions were used to assess participant demographics, daily electronics use, pain score and perceptions towards AI used to assist in interpretation of their radiographs, and guide management. Results 216 questionnaires were included (M=126, F=90). Significantly higher confidence in clinician rather than AI-assisted interpretation was observed (clinician=9.20, SD=1.27 vs AI=7.06, SD=2.13), 95.4% reported favouring clinician over AI-performed interpretation in the event of disagreement. Small positive correlations were observed between younger age/educational achievement and confidence in AI-assistance. Students demonstrated similarly increased confidence (8.43, SD 1.80), and were over-represented in the minority who indicated a preference for AI-assessment over their clinicians (50%). Conclusions Participant’s held the clinician’s assessment in the highest regard and expressed a clear preference for it over the hypothetical AI assessment. However, robust confidence scores for the role of AI-assistance in interpreting skeletal imaging suggest patients view the technology favourably. Findings indicate that younger, more educated patients are potentially more comfortable with a role for AI-assistance however further research is needed to overcome the small number of responses on which these observations are based.","",""

Stage 3 will be virtual consensus meetings to consolidate and prioritise key items to be included in TRIPOD-AI and PROBAST-AI. Stage 4 will involve developing the TRIPOD-AI checklist and the PROBAST-AI tool, and writing the accompanying explanation and elaboration papers. In the final stage, stage 5, we will disseminate TRIPOD-AI and PROBAST-AI via journals, conferences, blogs, websites (including TRIPOD, PROBAST and EQUATOR Network) and social media. TRIPOD-AI will provide researchers working on prediction model studies based on machine learning with a reporting guideline that can help them report key details that readers need to evaluate the study quality and interpret its findings, potentially reducing research waste.

One version of the model populated partly by a survey of global catastrophic risk researchers finds the confidence that resilient foods is more cost effective than artificial general intelligence safety is ~86% and ~99% for the 100 millionth dollar spent on resilient foods at the margin now, respectively. Another version of the model based on one of the authors produced ~95% and ~99% confidence, respectively.

We attempt to solve this problem by employing two approaches, first, by detecting adversarial input and, second, by developing a confidence metric that can indicate when a DNN system has reached its limits and is not performing to the desired specifications. The effectiveness of our method at detecting adversarial input is demonstrated against the popular DeepFool adversarial image generation method. On a benchmark of 50,000 randomly chosen ImageNet adversarial images generated for CaffeNet and GoogLeNet DNNs, our method can recover the correct label with 95.76% and 97.43% accuracy, respectively.

The attribution based approach removes the need to store training or test data or to train an ensemble of models to obtain confidence scores. Hence, the ABC metric can be used when only the trained DNN is available during inference. We test the effectiveness of the ABC metric against both adversarial and out-of-distribution input. We experimental demonstrate that the ABC metric is high for ImageNet input and low for adversarial input generated by FGSM, PGD, DeepFool, CW, and adversarial patch methods.

Here, tailoring ligand chemistry can alter preferred spin or oxidation states as well as electronic structure properties and reactivity, creating vast regions of chemical space to explore when designing new materials atom by atom. Although first-principles density functional theory (DFT) remains the workhorse of computational chemistry in mechanism deduction and property prediction, it is of limited use here. DFT is both far too computationally costly for widespread exploration of transition-metal chemical space and also prone to inaccuracies that limit its predictive performance for localized d electrons in transition-metal complexes. These challenges starkly contrast with the well-trodden regions of small-organic-molecule chemical space, where the analytical forms of molecular mechanics force fields and semiempirical theories have for decades accelerated the discovery of new molecules, accurate DFT functional performance has been demonstrated, and gold-standard methods from correlated wavefunction theory can predict experimental results to chemical accuracy.The combined promise of transition-metal chemical space exploration and lack of established tools has mandated a distinct approach. In this Account, we outline the path we charted in exploration of transition-metal chemical space starting from the first machine learning (ML) models (i.e., artificial neural network and kernel ridge regression) and representations for the prediction of open-shell transition-metal complex properties. The distinct importance of the immediate coordination environment of the metal center as well as the lack of low-level methods to accurately predict structural properties in this coordination environment first motivated and then benefited from these ML models and representations. Once developed, the recipe for prediction of geometric, spin state, and redox potential properties was straightforwardly extended to a diverse range of other properties, including in catalysis, computational ""feasibility"", and the gas separation properties of periodic metal-organic frameworks. Interpretation of selected features most important for model prediction revealed new ways to encapsulate design rules and confirmed that models were robustly mapping essential structure-property relationships. Encountering the special challenge of ensuring that good model performance could generalize to new discovery targets motivated investigation of how to best carry out model uncertainty quantification. Distance-based approaches, whether in model latent space or in carefully engineered feature space, provided intuitive measures of the domain of applicability. With all of these pieces together, ML can be harnessed as an engine to tackle the large-scale exploration of transition-metal chemical space needed to satisfy multiple objectives using efficient global optimization methods. In practical terms, bringing these artificial intelligence tools to bear on the problems of transition-metal chemical space exploration has resulted in ML-model assessments of large, multimillion compound spaces in minutes and validated new design leads in weeks instead of decades.","",""

In this paper, we propose backdoor trigger patterns--hidden malicious functionalities that cause misclassification--to automate the evaluation of saliency explanations. Our key observation is that triggers provide ground truth for inputs to evaluate whether the regions identified by an XAI method are truly relevant to its output. Since backdoor triggers are the most important features that cause deliberate misclassification, a robust XAI method should reveal their presence at inference time. We introduce three complementary metrics for the systematic evaluation of explanations that an XAI method generates. We evaluate seven state-of-the-art model-free and model-specific post-hoc methods through 36 models trojaned with specifically crafted triggers using color, shape, texture, location, and size.

Materials and Methods A deep learning AI system was developed to identify suspicious soft-tissue and calcified lesions in DBT images. A reader study compared the performance of 24 radiologists (13 of whom were breast subspecialists) reading 260 DBT examinations (including 65 cancer cases) both with and without AI. Readings occurred in two sessions separated by at least 4 weeks. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), reading time, sensitivity, specificity, and recall rate were evaluated with statistical methods for multireader, multicase studies.   Results Radiologist performance for the detection of malignant lesions, measured by mean AUC, increased 0.057 with the use of AI (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.028, 0.087; P < .01), from 0.795 without AI to 0.852 with AI. Reading time decreased 52.7% (95% CI: 41.8%, 61.5%; P < .01), from 64.1 seconds without to 30.4 seconds with AI. Sensitivity increased from 77.0% without AI to 85.0% with AI (8.0%; 95% CI: 2.6%, 13.4%; P < .01), specificity increased from 62.7% without to 69.6% with AI (6.9%; 95% CI: 3.0%, 10.8%; noninferiority P < .01), and recall rate for noncancers decreased from 38.0% without to 30.9% with AI (7.2%; 95% CI: 3.1%, 11.2%; noninferiority P < .01).   Conclusion The concurrent use of an accurate DBT AI system was found to improve cancer detection efficacy in a reader study that demonstrated increases in AUC, sensitivity, and specificity and a reduction in recall rate and reading time.© RSNA, 2019See also the commentary by Hsu and Hoyt in this issue.","",""

Systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX), an experimental approach for aptamer screening, allows the selection and identification of in vitro aptamers with high affinity and specificity. However, the SELEX process is time consuming and characterization of the representative aptamer candidates from SELEX is rather laborious. Artificial intelligence (AI) could help to rapidly identify the potential aptamer candidates from a vast number of sequences. This review discusses the advancements of AI pipelines/methods, including structure-based and machine/deep learning-based methods, for predicting the binding ability of aptamers to targets. Structure-based methods are the most used in computer-aided drug design.

We also performed analysis to compare the accuracy of different secondary and tertiary structure prediction methods for aptamers. On the other hand, advanced machine-/deep-learning models have witnessed successes in predicting the binding abilities between targets and ligands in drug discovery and thus potentially offer a robust and accurate approach to predict the binding between aptamers and targets. The research utilizing machine-/deep-learning techniques for prediction of aptamer–target binding is limited currently. Therefore, perspectives for models, algorithms, and implementation strategies of machine/deep learning-based methods are discussed.

SUMMARY ANSWER We have combined computer vision image processing methods and deep learning techniques to create the non-invasive Life Whisperer AI model for robust prediction of embryo viability, as measured by clinical pregnancy outcome, using single static images of Day 5 blastocysts obtained from standard optical light microscope systems. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY Embryo selection following IVF is a critical factor in determining the success of ensuing pregnancy. Traditional morphokinetic grading by trained embryologists can be subjective and variable, and other complementary techniques, such as time-lapse imaging, require costly equipment and have not reliably demonstrated predictive ability for the endpoint of clinical pregnancy. AI methods are being investigated as a promising means for improving embryo selection and predicting implantation and pregnancy outcomes. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION These studies involved analysis of retrospectively collected data including standard optical light microscope images and clinical outcomes of 8886 embryos from 11 different IVF clinics, across three different countries, between 2011 and 2018. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS The AI-based model was trained using static two-dimensional optical light microscope images with known clinical pregnancy outcome as measured by fetal heartbeat to provide a confidence score for prediction of pregnancy. Predictive accuracy was determined by evaluating sensitivity, specificity and overall weighted accuracy, and was visualized using histograms of the distributions of predictions. Comparison to embryologists’ predictive accuracy was performed using a binary classification approach and a 5-band ranking comparison. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE The Life Whisperer AI model showed a sensitivity of 70.1% for viable embryos while maintaining a specificity of 60.5% for non-viable embryos across three independent blind test sets from different clinics. The weighted overall accuracy in each blind test set was >63%, with a combined accuracy of 64.3% across both viable and non-viable embryos, demonstrating model robustness and generalizability beyond the result expected from chance. Distributions of predictions showed clear separation of correctly and incorrectly classified embryos. Binary comparison of viable/non-viable embryo classification demonstrated an improvement of 24.7% over embryologists’ accuracy (P = 0.047, n = 2, Student’s t test), and 5-band ranking comparison demonstrated an improvement of 42.0% over embryologists (P = 0.028, n = 2, Student’s t test). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION The AI model developed here is limited to analysis of Day 5 embryos; therefore, further evaluation or modification of the model is needed to incorporate information from different time points. The endpoint described is clinical pregnancy as measured by fetal heartbeat, and this does not indicate the probability of live birth. The current investigation was performed with retrospectively collected data, and hence it will be of importance to collect data prospectively to assess real-world use of the AI model. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS These studies demonstrated an improved predictive ability for evaluation of embryo viability when compared with embryologists’ traditional morphokinetic grading methods. The superior accuracy of the Life Whisperer AI model could lead to improved pregnancy success rates in IVF when used in a clinical setting. It could also potentially assist in standardization of embryo selection methods across multiple clinical environments, while eliminating the need for complex time-lapse imaging equipment. Finally, the cloud-based software application used to apply the Life Whisperer AI model in clinical practice makes it broadly applicable and globally scalable to IVF clinics worldwide.

Firms that invest in AI experience faster growth in both sales and employment, which translates into analogous growth at the industry level. The positive effects are concentrated among the ex ante largest firms, leading to a positive correlation between AI investments and an increase in industry concentration. However, the increase in concentration is not accompanied by either increased markups or increased productivity. Instead, firms tend to expand into new product and geographic markets.

We aimed to assess the ability of Canon’s AUTOStroke Solution LVO application in properly detecting and locating LVOs in AIS patients. Data from 202 LVO and 101 non-LVO AIS patients who presented with stroke-like symptoms between March 2019 and February 2020 were collected retrospectively. LVO patients had either an internal carotid artery (ICA) (n = 59), M1 middle cerebral artery (MCA) (n = 82) or M2 MCA (n = 61) occlusion. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) scans from each patient were pushed to the automation platform and analyzed. The algorithm’s ability to detect LVOs was assessed using accuracy, sensitivity and Matthews correlation coefficients (MCCs) for each occlusion type. The following results were calculated for each occlusion type in the study (accuracy, sensitivity, MCC): ICA = (0.95, 0.90, 0.89), M1 MCA = (0.89, 0.77, 0.78) and M2 MCA = (0.80, 0.51, 0.59). For the non-LVO cohort, 98% (99/101) of cases were correctly predicted as LVO negative. Processing time for each case was 69.8 ± 1.1 seconds (95% confidence interval). Canon’s AUTOStroke Solution LVO application was able to accurately identify ICA and M1 MCA occlusions in addition to almost perfectly assessing when an LVO was not present. M2 MCA occlusion detection needs further improvement based on the sensitivity results displayed by the LVO detection algorithm.","",""

To meet this need, we developed an interpretable artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm for HFrEF screening using electrocardiography (ECG) and validated its performance. This retrospective cohort study included two hospitals. An AI algorithm based on a convolutional neural network was developed using 39,371 ECG results from 17,127 patients. The internal validation included 3,470 ECGs from 2,908 patients. Furthermore, we conducted external validation using 4,362 ECGs from 4,176 patients from another hospital to verify the applicability of the algorithm across different centers. The end-point was to detect HFrEF, defined as an ejection fraction <40%. We also visualized the regions in 12 lead ECG that affected HFrEF detection in the AI algorithm and compared this to the previously documented literature. During the internal and external validation, the areas under the curves of the AI algorithm using a 12 lead ECG for detecting HFrEF were 0.913 (95% confidence interval, 0.902-0.925) and 0.961 (0.951-0.971), respectively, and the areas under the curves of the AI algorithm using a single-lead ECG were 0.874 (0.859-0.890) and 0.929 (0.911-0.946), respectively. The deep learning-based AI algorithm performed HFrEF detection well using not only a 12 lead but also a single-lead ECG. These results suggest that HFrEF can be screened not only using a 12 lead ECG, as is typical of a conventional ECG machine, but also with a single-lead ECG performed by a wearable device employing the AI algorithm, thereby preventing irreversible disease progression and mortality.","",""

The use of artificial intelligence to detect papilledema and other optic-disk abnormalities from fundus photographs has not been well studied.   METHODS We trained, validated, and externally tested a deep-learning system to classify optic disks as being normal or having papilledema or other abnormalities from 15,846 retrospectively collected ocular fundus photographs that had been obtained with pharmacologic pupillary dilation and various digital cameras in persons from multiple ethnic populations. Of these photographs, 14,341 from 19 sites in 11 countries were used for training and validation, and 1505 photographs from 5 other sites were used for external testing. Performance at classifying the optic-disk appearance was evaluated by calculating the area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity, as compared with a reference standard of clinical diagnoses by neuro-ophthalmologists.   RESULTS The training and validation data sets from 6779 patients included 14,341 photographs: 9156 of normal disks, 2148 of disks with papilledema, and 3037 of disks with other abnormalities. The percentage classified as being normal ranged across sites from 9.8 to 100%; the percentage classified as having papilledema ranged across sites from zero to 59.5%. In the validation set, the system discriminated disks with papilledema from normal disks and disks with nonpapilledema abnormalities with an AUC of 0.99 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.98 to 0.99) and normal from abnormal disks with an AUC of 0.99 (95% CI, 0.99 to 0.99). In the external-testing data set of 1505 photographs, the system had an AUC for the detection of papilledema of 0.96 (95% CI, 0.95 to 0.97), a sensitivity of 96.4% (95% CI, 93.9 to 98.3), and a specificity of 84.7% (95% CI, 82.3 to 87.1).

Objective The purpose of this systematic literature review was to identify and analyze quantitative studies utilizing or integrating AI to address and report clinical-level patient safety outcomes. Methods We restricted our search to the PubMed, PubMed Central, and Web of Science databases to retrieve research articles published in English between January 2009 and August 2019. We focused on quantitative studies that reported positive, negative, or intermediate changes in patient safety outcomes using AI apps, specifically those based on machine-learning algorithms and natural language processing. Quantitative studies reporting only AI performance but not its influence on patient safety outcomes were excluded from further review. Results We identified 53 eligible studies, which were summarized concerning their patient safety subcategories, the most frequently used AI, and reported performance metrics. Recognized safety subcategories were clinical alarms (n=9; mainly based on decision tree models), clinical reports (n=21; based on support vector machine models), and drug safety (n=23; mainly based on decision tree models). Analysis of these 53 studies also identified two essential findings: (1) the lack of a standardized benchmark and (2) heterogeneity in AI reporting. Conclusions This systematic review indicates that AI-enabled decision support systems, when implemented correctly, can aid in enhancing patient safety by improving error detection, patient stratification, and drug management. Future work is still needed for robust validation of these systems in prospective and real-world clinical environments to understand how well AI can predict safety outcomes in health care settings.","",""

Here, we evaluated the performance of Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Networks for automated image analysis, using a global coral reef monitoring dataset. The study demonstrates the advantages of automated image analysis for coral reef monitoring in terms of error and repeatability of benthic abundance estimations, as well as cost and benefit. We found unbiased and high agreement between expert and automated observations (97%). Repeated surveys and comparisons against existing monitoring programs also show that automated estimation of benthic composition is equally robust in detecting change and ensuring the continuity of existing monitoring data. Using this automated approach, data analysis and reporting can be accelerated by at least 200x and at a fraction of the cost (1%).

We examined the model performance of atomic convolutional neural network (ACNN) on the PDBbind core set and achieved a Pearson R2 of 0.73 between experimental and predicted binding affinities. Strikingly, the ACNN models did not require learning the essential protein-ligand interactions in complex structures and achieved similar performance even on datasets containing only ligand structures or only protein structures, while data splitting based on similarity clustering (protein sequence or ligand scaffold) significantly reduced the model performance. We also identified the property and topology biases in the DUD-E dataset which led to the artificially increased enrichment performance of virtual screening. The property bias in DUD-E was reduced by enforcing the more stringent ligand property matching rules, while the topology bias still exists due to the use of molecular fingerprint similarity as a decoy selection criterion.

We focus on two aspects of clinical artificial intelligence used for decision-making: moral accountability for harm to patients; and safety assurance to protect patients against such harm. Artificial intelligence-based tools are challenging the standard clinical practices of assigning blame and assuring safety. Human clinicians and safety engineers have weaker control over the decisions reached by artificial intelligence systems and less knowledge and understanding of precisely how the artificial intelligence systems reach their decisions. We illustrate this analysis by applying it to an example of an artificial intelligence-based system developed for use in the treatment of sepsis. The paper ends with practical suggestions for ways forward to mitigate these concerns. We argue for a need to include artificial intelligence developers and systems safety engineers in our assessments of moral accountability for patient harm. Meanwhile, none of the actors in the model robustly fulfil the traditional conditions of moral accountability for the decisions of an artificial intelligence system. We should therefore update our conceptions of moral accountability in this context. We also need to move from a static to a dynamic model of assurance, accepting that considerations of safety are not fully resolvable during the design of the artificial intelligence system before the system has been deployed.","",""

First, while the discipline is still young, the analysis indicates a growing acceptance of XAI in PHM. Second, XAI offers dual advantages, where it is assimilated as a tool to execute PHM tasks and explain diagnostic and anomaly detection activities, implying a real need for XAI in PHM. Third, the review shows that PHM-XAI papers provide interesting results, suggesting that the PHM performance is unaffected by the XAI.

Screening mammograms were processed using a detection algorithm based on deep learning.

Although AI is a broad discipline, machine learning is a specific branch of AI that uses computer algorithms capable of “learning” through the simulation of human intelligence. Machine learning algorithms have been applied to the medical field since the 1970s,1 and since that time have proven useful in computerassisted diagnosis, screening, and prognostication of disease.2–7 Ophthalmology is uniquely capable of capitalizing on the promise of AI. Ophthalmologists, during routine clinical encounters, generate robust data sources capable of supporting machine learning algorithms including multimodal ophthalmic images and quantifiable metrics such as visual acuity (VA), intraocular pressure, and cup to disk ratio. To date, AI techniques have been applied to ophthalmology to screen for and diagnose diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy (DR), age-related macular degeneration (AMD), macular edema (ME), glaucoma, keratoconus, postlaserassisted in situ keratomileusis corneal ectasia, retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), and cataracts, as well as predict the prognosis of various ophthalmic diseases. Advances in ophthalmology-specific AI stand to increase patient access to clinical screening and diagnosis as well as decrease health care costs, especially when applied to high-risk populations, low-resource communities, or when combined with telemedicine initiatives. This review provides an introduction to AI andmachine learning, as well as an overview of current applications in the field of ophthalmology.","",""

Generally, it is believed that a huge number of ECGs are necessary for developing an AI-enabled ECG to be adequate to correspond to a lot of minor variations of ECGs. For example, structural heart diseases have typical ECG characteristics, but they could be a noise for the purpose of detecting the small signs of electrocardiographic signature of AF. We hypothesized that when patients with structural heart diseases are excluded, AI-enabled ECG for identifying patients with AF can be developed with a small number of ECGs.        We developed an AI-enabled ECG using a convolutional neural network to detect the electrocardiographic signature of AF present during normal sinus rhythm (NSR) using a digital, standard 10-second, 12-lead ECGs. We included all patients who newly visited the Cardiovascular Institute with at least one NSR ECG between Feb 1, 2010, and March 31, 2018. We classified patients with at least one ECG with a rhythm of AF as positive for AF (AF label) and others as negative for AF (SR label). We allocated ECGs to the training, internal validation, and testing datasets in a 7:1:2 ratio. We calculated the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curve for the internal validation dataset to select a probability threshold, which we applied to the testing dataset. We evaluated model performance on the testing dataset by calculating the AUC and the sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, and accuracy with two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs).        We totally included 19170 patients with 12-lead ECG. After excluding patients with structural heart diseases, 12825 patients with NSR ECGs at the initial visit were identified (1262 were clinically diagnosed as AF anytime during the time course and 11563 were never diagnosed as AF). Of 11563 non-AF patients, 1818 patients who were followed over 1095 days were selected for the analysis with the SR label, to secure the robustness for maintaining SR. Of 1262 AF patients, 251 patients were selected for the analysis with the AF label, of whom a NSR ECG within 31 days before or after the index AF ECG (the first AF ECG during the time course) could be obtained. In the patients with AF label, the NSR ECG of which the date was the nearest to the index AF ECG was selected for the analysis. The AI-enabled ECG showed an AUC of 0.88 (0.84–0.92) with sensitivity 81% (72–88), specificity 80% (77–83), F1 score 50% (43–57), and overall accuracy 80% (78–83).        An AI-enabled ECG acquired during NSR allowed identification of patients with AF in a small population without structural heart diseases.        Type of funding sources: None. ","",""

AI systems can be used as tools to create algorithms identifying asymptomatic women with short cervical length who are at risk of preterm birth. Additionally, the benefits of using the vast data capacity of AI storage can assist in determining the risk factors for preterm labor using multiomics and extensive genomic data. In the field of gynecological surgery, the use of augmented reality helps surgeons detect vital structures, thus decreasing complications, reducing operative time, and helping surgeons in training to practice in a realistic setting. Using three-dimensional (3D) printers can provide materials that mimic real tissues and also helps trainees to practice on a realistic model. Furthermore, 3D imaging allows better depth perception than its two-dimensional (2D) counterpart, allowing the surgeon to create preoperative plans according to tissue depth and dimensions. Although AI has some limitations, this new technology can improve the prognosis and management of patients, reduce healthcare costs, and help OB/GYN practitioners to reduce their workload and increase their efficiency and accuracy by incorporating AI systems into their daily practice. AI has the potential to guide practitioners in decision-making, reaching a diagnosis, and improving case management. It can reduce healthcare costs by decreasing medical errors and providing more dependable predictions. AI systems can accurately provide information on the large array of patients in clinical settings, although more robust data is required.","",""

As the first step, the AVI trace is segregated into observation pairs using the Maximum Likelihood Estimation and then it is further joined with GPS co-ordinates to tackle the sparse issues. As the next step, the heterogeneity and correlation between the various pairs are determined using Mixed Logit model. As the final step, a relationship between the likelihood function and route choice model is established using Maximum to log-likelihood function. Based on the observations, the results are recorded and the proposed work shows significant improvement in the accuracy in route determination.

One extensively used method to minimize the cost and time for the drug development process is computer-aided drug design (CADD). CADD allows better focusing on experiments, which can reduce the time and cost involved in researching new drugs. In this context, structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) is robust and useful and is one of the most promising in silico techniques for drug design. SBVS attempts to predict the best interaction mode between two molecules to form a stable complex, and it uses scoring functions to estimate the force of non-covalent interactions between a ligand and molecular target. Thus, scoring functions are the main reason for the success or failure of SBVS software. Many software programs are used to perform SBVS, and since they use different algorithms, it is possible to obtain different results from different software using the same input. In the last decade, a new technique of SBVS called consensus virtual screening (CVS) has been used in some studies to increase the accuracy of SBVS and to reduce the false positives obtained in these experiments. An indispensable condition to be able to utilize SBVS is the availability of a 3D structure of the target protein. Some virtual databases, such as the Protein Data Bank, have been created to store the 3D structures of molecules. However, sometimes it is not possible to experimentally obtain the 3D structure. In this situation, the homology modeling methodology allows the prediction of the 3D structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence. This review presents an overview of the challenges involved in the use of CADD to perform SBVS, the areas where CADD tools support SBVS, a comparison between the most commonly used tools, and the techniques currently used in an attempt to reduce the time and cost in the drug development process. Finally, the final considerations demonstrate the importance of using SBVS in the drug development process.","",""

Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms have been used to decrease subjectivity in medical image interpretation. One out of 2 women over the age of 50 years may have a thyroid nodule and at present the only way to exclude malignancy is through invasive procedures. Hence, there exists a need for noninvasive objective classification of thyroid nodules. Some cancers have benign appearance on ultrasonogram. Hence, we decided to create an image similarity algorithm rather than image classification algorithm. Methods Ultrasound images of thyroid nodules from patients who underwent either biopsy or thyroid surgery from February 2012 through February 2017 in our institution were used to create AI models. Nodules were excluded if there was no definitive diagnosis of it being benign or malignant. A total of 482 nodules met the inclusion criteria and all available images from these nodules were used to create the AI models. Later, these AI models were used to test 103 thyroid nodules which underwent biopsy or surgery from March 2017 through July 2018.

Using Monte Carlo (probabilistic) models, we analyze the long-term cost-effectiveness of resilient foods (alternative foods) - roughly those independent of sunlight such as mushrooms. One version of the model populated partly by a survey of global catastrophic risk researchers finds the confidence that resilient foods is more cost effective than artificial general intelligence safety is the 100 millionth on resilient the margin now, respectively. Another version of the model based on one of the authors produced and ∼ 99% confidence, respectively. Considering uncertainty represented within our models, our result is robust: reverting the conclusion required simultaneously changing the 3-5 most important parameters to the pessimistic ends. However, as predicting the long-run trajectory of human civilization is extremely difficult, and model and theory uncertainties are very large, this significantly reduces our overall confidence. Because the agricultural catastrophes could happen immediately and because existing expertise relevant to resilient foods could be co-opted by charitable giving, it is likely optimal to spend most of the money for resilient foods in the next few years. Both cause areas generally save expected current lives inexpensively and should attract greater investment.","",""

However, AI implication remains intricate for researchers/clinicians lacking specific training in computational tools and informatics. Cancer is a major cause of death worldwide, accounting for an estimated 9.6 million deaths in 2018. Certain cancers, such as pancreatic and gastric cancers, are detected only after they have reached their advanced stages with frequent relapses. Cancer is one of the most complex diseases affecting a range of organs with diverse disease progression mechanisms and the effectors ranging from gene-epigenetics to a wide array of metabolites. Hence a comprehensive study, including genomics, epi-genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, along with the medical/mass-spectrometry imaging, patient clinical history, treatments provided, genetics, and disease endemicity, is essential. Cancer Moonshot℠ Research Initiatives by NIH National Cancer Institute aims to collect as much information as possible from different regions of the world and make a cancer data repository. AI could play an immense role in (a) analysis of complex and heterogeneous data sets (multi-omics and/or inter-omics), (b) data integration to provide a holistic disease molecular mechanism, (c) identification of diagnostic and prognostic markers, and (d) monitor patient’s response to drugs/treatments and recovery. AI enables precision disease management well beyond the prevalent disease stratification patterns, such as differential expression and supervised classification. This review highlights critical advances and challenges in omics data analysis, dealing with data variability from lab-to-lab, and data integration. We also describe methods used in data mining and AI methods to obtain robust results for precision medicine from “big” data.

Methods DERM was trained and tested using 7,102 dermoscopic images of both histologically confirmed melanoma (24%) and benign pigmented lesions (76%). A meta-analysis was conducted of studies examining the accuracy of naked-eye examination, with or without dermoscopy, by specialist and general physicians whose clinical diagnosis was compared to histopathology. The meta-analysis was based on evaluation of 32,226 pigmented lesions including 3,277 histopathology-confirmed malignant melanoma cases. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to examine and compare the diagnostic accuracy.   Results DERM achieved a ROC area under the curve (AUC) of 0.93 (95% confidence interval: 0.92-0.94), and sensitivity and specificity of 85.0% and 85.3%, respectively. Avoidance of false-negative results is essential, so different decision thresholds were examined.

In this context, the authors provide evidence of a novel “word-of-machine” effect, the phenomenon by which utilitarian/hedonic attribute trade-offs determine preference for, or resistance to, AI-based recommendations compared with traditional word of mouth, or human-based recommendations. The word-of-machine effect stems from a lay belief that AI recommenders are more competent than human recommenders in the utilitarian realm and less competent than human recommenders in the hedonic realm. As a consequence, importance or salience of utilitarian attributes determine preference for AI recommenders over human ones, and importance or salience of hedonic attributes determine resistance to AI recommenders over human ones (Studies 1–4). The word-of machine effect is robust to attribute complexity, number of options considered, and transaction costs. The word-of-machine effect reverses for utilitarian goals if a recommendation needs matching to a person’s unique preferences (Study 5) and is eliminated in the case of human–AI hybrid decision making (i.e., augmented rather than artificial intelligence; Study 6).

Formation bulk density (RHOB) logging data greatly assist in identifying downhole formations. These data are measured in the field while drilling by using a density log tool in the form of either a logging while drilling (LWD) technique or (more often) by wireline logging after the formations are drilled. This is due to operational limitations during the drilling process. Therefore, the objective of this study was to develop a predictive tool for estimating RHOB while drilling using an adaptive network-based fuzzy interference system (ANFIS), functional network (FN), and support vector machine (SVM). The proposed model uses the mechanical drilling constraints as feeding input parameters, and the conventional RHOB log data as an output parameter. These mechanical drilling parameters are usually measured while drilling, and their responses vary with different formations. A dataset of 2400 actual datapoints, obtained from a horizontal well in the Middle East, were used to build the proposed models. The obtained dataset was divided into a 70/30 ratio for model training and testing, respectively. The optimized ANFIS-based model outperformed the FN- and SVM-based models with a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.93, and average absolute percentage error (AAPE) of 0.81% between the predicted and measured RHOB values. These results demonstrate the reliability of the developed ANFIS model for predicting RHOB while drilling, based on the mechanical drilling parameters. Subsequently, the ANFIS-based model was validated using unseen data from another well within the same field. The validation process yielded an AAPE of 0.97% between the predicted and actual RHOB values, which confirmed the robustness of the developed model as an effective predictive tool for RHOB.","",""

Our results apply to general multi-class classifiers that map from an input space into a decision space, including artificial neural networks used in deep learning applications. Two classes of attacks are considered. The first class involves adversarial examples and concerns the introduction of small perturbations of the input data that cause misclassification. The second class, introduced here for the first time and named stealth attacks, involves small perturbations to the AI system itself. Here the perturbed system produces whatever output is desired by the attacker on a specific small data set, perhaps even a single input, but performs as normal on a validation set (which is unknown to the attacker).We show that in both cases, i.e., in the case of an attack based on adversarial examples and in the case of a stealth attack, the dimensionality of the AI’s decision-making space is a major contributor to the AI’s susceptibility. For attacks based on adversarial examples, a second crucial parameter is the absence of local concentrations in the data probability distribution, a property known as Smeared Absolute Continuity. According to our findings, robustness to adversarial examples requires either (a) the data distributions in the AI’s feature space to have concentrated probability density functions or (b) the dimensionality of the AI’s decision variables to be sufficiently small. We also show how to construct stealth attacks on high-dimensional AI systems that are hard to spot unless the validation set is made exponentially large.","",""

Sixty-nine studies were split into three categories: AI/ML and HD, PD, and KT, respectively. We identified 43 trials in the first group, 8 in the second, and 18 in the third. Then, studies were classified according to the type of algorithm. Results AI and HD trials covered: (a) dialysis service management, (b) dialysis procedure, (c) anemia management, (d) hormonal/dietary issues, and (e) arteriovenous fistula assessment. PD studies were divided into (a) peritoneal technique issues, (b) infections, and (c) cardiovascular event prediction. AI in transplantation studies were allocated into (a) management systems (ML used as pretransplant organ-matching tools), (b) predicting graft rejection, (c) tacrolimus therapy modulation, and (d) dietary issues. Conclusions Although guidelines are reluctant to recommend AI implementation in daily practice, there is plenty of evidence that AI/ML algorithms can predict better than nephrologists: volumes, Kt/V, and hypotension or cardiovascular events during dialysis.

Therefore, estimation of nonsinusoidal AC loss of high temperature superconducting (HTS) material would be of great interest for designers of large-scale superconducting devices. In this paper, at first nonsinusoidal AC loss of a typical HTS tape was calculated under distorted currents using H-formulation finite element method. Then, a range of artificial intelligence (AI) models were implemented to predict AC loss of a typical HTS tape.

Objective The study aims to investigate relative sensitivity of CCE compared with CTC following incomplete OC, investigate the completion rate when combining results from the incomplete OC and CCE, and develop a forward-tracking algorithm ensuring a safe completeness of combined investigations. Methods In this prospective paired study, patients with indication for CTC following incomplete OC were included for CCE and CTC. Location of CCE abortion and OC abortion were registered to identify complete combined investigations. AI-based algorithm for localization of capsules were developed reconstructing the passage of the colon. Results In 237 individuals with CTC indication; 105 were included, of which 97 underwent both a CCE and CTC. CCE was complete in 66 (68%). Including CCEs which reached most oral point of incomplete OC, 73 (75%) had complete colonic investigations; 78 (80%) had conclusive investigations. Relative sensitivity of CCE compared with CTC was 2.67 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.76;4.04) for polyps >5 mm and 1.91 (95% CI 1.18;3.09) for polyps >9 mm. An AI-based algorithm was developed.

Genetic subtypes uncovered recently are based on distinct genetic alterations in DLBCL, which are different from the COO subtypes defined by gene expression signatures of normal B cells retained in DLBCL. We hypothesize that classifiers incorporating both genome-wide gene-expression and pathogenetic variables can improve the therapeutic significance of DLBCL classification. To develop such refined classifiers, we performed targeted RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) with a commercially available next-generation sequencing (NGS) platform in a large cohort of 418 DLBCLs. Genetic and transcriptional data obtained by RNA-Seq in a single run were explored by state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) to develop a NGS-COO classifier for COO assignment and NGS survival models for clinical outcome prediction. The NGS-COO model built through applying AI in the training set was robust, showing high concordance with COO classification by either Affymetrix GeneChip microarray or the NanoString Lymph2Cx assay in 2 validation sets. Although the NGS-COO model was not trained for clinical outcome, the activated B-cell-like compared with the germinal-center B-cell-like subtype had significantly poorer survival. The NGS survival models stratified 30% high-risk patients in the validation set with poor survival as in the training set. These results demonstrate that targeted RNA-Seq coupled with AI deep learning techniques provides reproducible, efficient, and affordable assays for clinical application. The clinical grade assays and NGS models integrating both genetic and transcriptional factors developed in this study may eventually support precision medicine in DLBCL.","",""

For training, data must be appropriately valued, and deals with AI companies must be centralized. Companies must clearly define anonymization and consent, and patients must be well-informed about their data usage. Data fed into algorithms must be made AI-ready by refining, purification, digitization and centralization. Finally, data must represent various demographics. AI needs to be safely integrated with radiologists-in-the-loop: guiding forming concepts of AI solutions and supervising training and feedback. To be well-regulated, AI systems must be approved by a health authority and agreements must be made upon liability for errors, roles of supervised and unsupervised AI and fair workforce distribution (between AI and radiologists), with a renewal of policy at regular intervals.

Unfortunately, the pursuit and use of such therapies have been hindered by a common challenge: patients with specific rare diseases are difficult to identify, especially if the conditions resemble more prevalent disorders. Cardiac amyloidosis is one such rare disease, which is characterized by deposition of misfolded proteins within the heart muscle resulting in heart failure and death. In recent years, specific therapies have emerged for cardiac amyloidosis and several more are under investigation, but because cardiac amyloidosis is mistaken for common forms of heart failure, it is typically diagnosed late in its course. As a possible solution, artificial intelligence methods could enable automated detection of rare diseases, but model performance must address low disease prevalence. Here we present an automated multi-modality pipeline for cardiac amyloidosis detection using two neural-network models; one using electrocardiograms (ECG) and the second using echocardiographic videos as input. These models were trained and validated on 3 and 5 academic medical centers (AMC), respectively, in the United States and Japan. Both models had excellent accuracy for detecting cardiac amyloidosis with C-statistics of 0.85-0.92 and 0.91-1.00 for the ECG and echocardiography models, respectively, with the latter outperforming expert diagnosis. Simulating deployment on 13,906 and 7775 patients with ECG-echocardiography paired data for AMC2 and AMC3 indicated a positive predictive value (PPV) for the ECG model of 4% and 3% at 61% and 54% recall, respectively. Pre-screening with ECG enhanced the echocardiography model performance from PPV 23% and 20% to PPV 58% and 53% at 64% recall, respectively for AMC2 and AMC3. In conclusion, we have developed a robust pipeline to augment detection of cardiac amyloidosis, which should serve as a generalizable strategy for other rare and intermediate frequency cardiac diseases with established or emerging therapies.","",""

Five hundred and forty-five secondary school students who have completed at least one cycle of AI course were recruited to participate in this study. Based on the theory of planned behavior, the students’ AI literacy, subjective norms, and anxiety were identified as background factors. These background factors were hypothesized to influence the students’ attitudes towards AI, their perceived behavioral control, and their intention to learn AI. To provide more nuanced understanding, the students’ attitude towards AI was further delineated as constituted by their perception of the usefulness of AI, the potential of AI technology to promote social good, and their attitude towards using AI technology. Similarly, the perceived behavioral control was operationalized as students’ confidence towards learning AI knowledge and optimistic outlook of an AI infused world. Relationships between the factors were theoretically illustrated as a model that depicts how students’ intention to learn AI was constituted. Two research questions were then formulated. Confirmatory factor analysis was employed to validate that multi-factor survey, followed by structural equational modelling to ascertain the significant associations between the factors. The confirmatory factor analysis supports the construct validity of the questionnaire. Twenty-five out of the thirty-three hypotheses were supported through structural equation modelling.

Methods and Results: An independent comprehensive search of the PubMed and Google Scholar database was conducted for articles dealing with the ability of AI to predict HF based on ECG signals. Only original articles published in peer-reviewed journals were considered. A total of five reports including 57,027 patients and 579,134 ECG datasets were identified including two sets of patient-level data and three with ECG-based datasets. The AI-processed ECG data yielded areas under the receiver operator characteristics curves between 0.92 and 0.99 to identify HF with higher values in ECG-based datasets. Applying a random-effects model, an sROC of 0.987 was calculated. Using the contingency tables led to diagnostic odds ratios ranging from 3.44 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 3.12–3.76] to 13.61 (95% CI = 13.14–14.08) also with lower values in patient-level datasets.

Using a systematic mapping, the articles were analyzed using quantitative and qualitative methods. It was observed that artificial intelligent methods have made remarkable contributions to combating cybercrimes with significant improvement in intrusion detection systems. It was also observed that there is a reduction in computational complexity, model training times and false alarms. However, there is a significant skewness within the domain. Most studies have focused on intrusion detection and prevention systems, and the most dominant technique used was support vector machines. The findings also revealed that majority of the studies were published in two journal outlets. It is therefore suggested that to enhance research in artificial intelligence for CyberSec, researchers need to adopt newer techniques and also publish in other related outlets.","",""

The student performance data taken over a six-year period in multiple courses ranging from the mid- to the advanced level and a diverse course offering mode (i.e., on-campus, ONC, and online, ONL) are modelled by ELM and further benchmarked against competing models: random forest (RF) and Volterra. With the assessments and examination marks as key predictors of WS (leading to a grade in the mid-level course), ELM (with respect to RF and Volterra) outperformed its counterpart models both for the ONC and the ONL offer. This generated relative prediction error in the testing phase, of only 0.74%, compared to about 3.12% and 1.06%, respectively, while for the ONL offer, the prediction errors were only 0.51% compared to about 3.05% and 0.70%. In modelling the student performance in advanced engineering mathematics course, ELM registered slightly larger errors: 0.77% (vs. 22.23% and 1.87%) for ONC and 0.54% (vs. 4.08% and 1.31%) for the ONL offer. This study advocates a pioneer implementation of a robust AI methodology to uncover relationships among student learning variables, developing teaching and learning intervention and course health checks to address issues related to graduate outcomes, and student learning attributes in the higher education sector.","",""
