Selectivity in the reflection and transmission spectra is manipulated by tailoring the geometrical parameters of the metasurface. Due to the immense number of possible metasurface configurations, we train deep neural networks capable of exploring all possible designs within the working parameter space.

We understand trustworthiness as the combination of explainability and robustness. Generative classifiers (GCs) are a promising class of models that are said to naturally accomplish these qualities. However, this has mostly been demonstrated on simple datasets such as MNIST, SVHN and CIFAR in the past. In this work, we firstly develop an architecture and training scheme that allows for GCs to be trained on the ImageNet classification task, a more relevant level of complexity for practical computer vision. The resulting models use an invertible neural network architecture and achieve a competetive ImageNet top-1 accuracy of up to 76.2%. Secondly, we show the large potential of GCs for trustworthiness. Explainability and some aspects of robustness are vastly improved compared to standard feed-forward models, even when the GCs are just applied naively. While not all trustworthiness problems are solved completely, we argue from our observations that GCs are an extremely promising basis for further algorithms and modifications, as have been developed in the past for feedforward models to increase their trustworthiness. We release our trained model for download in the hope that it serves as a starting point for various other generative classification tasks in much the same way as pretrained ResNet models do for discriminative classification.","",""

The characteristics of existing one-class labels lead to a dilemma: it is hard to directly use a multiple classifier based on deep neural networks to solve one-class classification problems. Therefore, in this article, we propose a novel DeepOC neural network, termed as DeepOC, which can simultaneously learn compact feature representations and train a DeepOC classifier. Only with the given normal samples, we use the stacked convolutional encoder to generate their low-dimensional high-level features and train a one-class classifier to make these features as compact as possible. Meanwhile, for the sake of the correct mapping relation and the feature representations’ diversity, we utilize a decoder in order to reconstruct raw samples from these low-dimensional feature representations. This structure is gradually established using an adversarial mechanism during the training stage. This mechanism is the key to our model. It organically combines two seemingly contradictory components and allows them to take advantage of each other, thus making the model robust and effective. Unlike methods that use handcrafted features or those that are separated into two stages (extracting features and training classifiers), DeepOC is a one-stage model using reliable features that are automatically extracted by neural networks. Experiments on various benchmark data sets show that DeepOC is feasible and achieves the state-of-the-art anomaly detection results compared with a dozen existing methods.","",""

However, various working requirements and the oceanic environment may cause some uncertain and unfavorable factors for ship-mounted crane control. In particular, to accomplish different control tasks, some plant parameters (e.g., boom lengths, payload masses, and so on) frequently change; hence, most existing model-based controllers cannot ensure satisfactory control performance any longer. For example, inaccurate gravity compensation may result in positioning errors. Additionally, due to ship roll motions caused by sea waves, residual payload swing generally exists, which may result in safety risks in practice. To solve the above-mentioned issues, this paper designs a neural network-based adaptive control method that can provide effective control for both actuated and unactuated state variables based on the original nonlinear ship-mounted crane dynamics without any linearizing operations. In particular, the proposed update law availably compensates parameter/structure uncertainties for ship-mounted crane systems. Based on a 2-D sliding surface, the boom and rope can arrive at their preset positions in finite time, and the payload swing can be completely suppressed. Furthermore, the problem of nonlinear input dead zones is also taken into account. The stability of the equilibrium point of all state variables in ship-mounted crane systems is theoretically proven by a rigorous Lyapunov-based analysis. The hardware experimental results verify the practicability and robustness of the presented control approach.","",""

Furthermore, for steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) BCI systems, multiple states (sub-states) exist within the IC state. Existing recognition methods rely on a threshold technique, which is difficult to realize high accuracy, i.e., simultaneously high true positive rate and low false positive rate. To address this issue, we proposed a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect IC and NC states in a SSVEP-BCI system for the first time. Specifically, the steady-state motion visual evoked potentials (SSMVEP) paradigm, which has been shown to induce less visual discomfort, was chosen as the experimental paradigm. Two processing pipelines were proposed for the detection of IC and NC states. The first one was using CNN as a multi-class classifier to discriminate between all the states in IC and NC state (FFT-CNN). The second one was using CNN to discriminate between IC and NC states, and using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to perform classification tasks within the IC (FFT-CNN-CCA). We demonstrated that both pipelines achieved a significant increase in accuracy for low-performance healthy participants when traditional algorithms such as CCA threshold were used. Furthermore, the FFT-CNN-CCA pipeline achieved better performance than the FFT-CNN pipeline based on the stroke patients’ data. In summary, we showed that CNN can be used for robust detection in an asynchronous SSMVEP-BCI with great potential for out-of-lab BCI applications.","",""

To match two key points, two image patches centered at the key points are entered into the proposed network. The network aims to learn discriminative feature representations for patch matching, so that more matching pairs can be obtained on the premise of maintaining higher subpixel matching accuracy.

This is mainly due to the development of Gaussian mixture model-based systems and in particular to the use of i-vectors. These systems handle relatively well noise and channel mismatches and yield a low error rate when confronted with zero-effort impostors, i.e. impostors using their own voice but claiming to be someone else. However, speaker verification systems are vulnerable to more sophisticated attacks, called presentation or spoofing attacks. In that case, the impostors present a fake sample to the system, which can either be generated with a speech synthesis or voice conversion algorithm or can be a previous recording of the target speaker. One way to make speaker recognition systems robust to this type of attack is to integrate a presentation attack detection system. Current methods for speaker recognition and presentation attack detection are largely based on short-term spectral processing. This has certain limitations. For instance, state-of-the-art speaker verification systems use cepstral features, which mainly capture vocal tract system characteristics, although voice source characteristics are also speaker discriminative. In the case of presentation attack detection, there is little prior knowledge that can guide us to differentiate bona fide samples from presentation attacks, as they are both speech signals that carry the same high level information, such as message, speaker identity and information about environment. This thesis focuses on developing speaker verification and presentation attack detection systems that rely on minimal assumptions. Towards that, inspired by recent advances in deep learning, we first develop speaker verification approaches where speaker discriminative information is learned from raw waveforms using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We show that such approaches are capable of learning both voice source related and vocal tract system related speaker discriminative information and yield performance competitive to state of the art systems, namely i-vectors and x-vectors-based systems. We then develop two high performing approaches for presentation attack detection: one based on long-term spectral statistics and the other based on raw speech modeling using CNNs. We show that these two approaches are complementary and make the speaker verification systems robust to presentation attacks. Finally, we develop a visualization method inspired from the computer vision community to gain insight about the task-specific information captured by the CNNs from the raw speech signals.","",""

The origin of this variability is uncertain, but it is usually interpreted as detrimental noise that reduces the computational accuracy of neural circuits. Here we investigate the possibility that such response variability might in fact be beneficial, because it may partially compensate for a decrease in accuracy due to stochastic changes in the synaptic strengths of a network. We study the interplay between two kinds of noise, response (or neuronal) noise and synaptic noise, by analyzing their joint influence on the accuracy of neural networks trained to perform various tasks. We find an interesting, generic interaction: when fluctuations in the synaptic connections are proportional to their strengths (multiplicative noise), a certain amount of response noise in the input neurons can significantly improve network performance, compared to the same network without response noise. Performance is enhanced because response noise and multiplicative synaptic noise are in some ways equivalent. So if the algorithm used to find the optimal synaptic weights can take into account the variability of the model neurons, it can also take into account the variability of the synapses. Thus, the connection patterns generated with response noise are typically more resistant to synaptic degradation than those obtained without response noise. As a consequence of this interplay, if multiplicative synaptic noise is present, it is better to have response noise in the network than not to have it. These results are demonstrated analytically for the most basic network consisting of two input neurons and one output neuron performing a simple classification task, but computer simulations show that the phenomenon persists in a wide range of architectures, including recurrent (attractor) networks and sensorimotor networks that perform coordinate transformations. The results suggest that response variability could play an important dynamic role in networks that continuously learn.","",""

Small perturbations to sensor inputs (from noise or adversarial examples) are often enough to change network-based decisions, which was recently shown to cause an autonomous vehicle to swerve into another lane. In light of these dangers, numerous algorithms have been developed as defensive mechanisms from these adversarial inputs, some of which provide formal robustness guarantees or certificates. This work leverages research on certified adversarial robustness to develop an online certifiably robust for deep reinforcement learning algorithms. The proposed defense computes guaranteed lower bounds on state-action values during execution to identify and choose a robust action under a worst case deviation in input space due to possible adversaries or noise. Moreover, the resulting policy comes with a certificate of solution quality, even though the true state and optimal action are unknown to the certifier due to the perturbations. The approach is demonstrated on a deep Q-network (DQN) policy and is shown to increase robustness to noise and adversaries in pedestrian collision avoidance scenarios, a classic control task, and Atari Pong.

To enhance robustness, we introduce a new adversarial defense called patch replacement, which transforms both the input images and their intermediate features at early layers to make adversarial perturbations behave similarly to random noise. We decompose images/features into small patches and quantize them according to a codebook learned from legitimate training images. This maintains the semantic information of legitimate images, while removing as much as possible the effect of adversarial perturbations. Experiments show that patch replacement improves robustness against both white-box and gray-box attacks, compared with other transformation-based defenses.

However, a single RGB camera may not be able to capture the actual object within the BB even if the CNN detector accuracy is high for the object. In this research, we present a solution to this limitation through the usage of multiple cameras, projective transformation, and a fuzzy logic–based fusion. The proposed algorithm generates a “confidence score” for each frame to check the trustworthiness of the BB generated by the CNN detector. As a first step toward this solution, we created a two-camera setup to detect objects. Agricultural weed is used as objects to be detected. A CNN detector generates BB for each camera when weed is present. Then a projective transformation is used to project one camera’s image plane to another camera’s image plane. The intersect over union (IOU) overlap of the BB is computed when objects are detected correctly. Four different scenarios are generated based on how far the object is from the multi-camera setup, and IOU overlap is calculated for each scenario (ground truth). When objects are detected correctly and bounding boxes are at correct distance, the IOU overlap value should be close to the ground truth IOU overlap value. On the other hand, the IOU overlap value should differ if BBs are at incorrect positions. Mamdani fuzzy rules are generated using this reasoning, and three different confidence scores (“high,” “ok,” and “low”) are given to each frame based on accuracy and position of BBs. The proposed algorithm was then tested under different conditions to check its validity. The confidence score of the proposed fuzzy system for three different scenarios supports the hypothesis that the multi-camera–based fusion algorithm improved the overall robustness of the detection system.","",""

Several proof of concept demonstrations have shown encouraging results, but barriers to clinical translation still remain. In particular, intracortical prostheses must satisfy stringent power dissipation constraints so as not to damage cortex.   APPROACH One possible solution is to use ultra-low power neuromorphic chips to decode neural signals for these intracortical implants. The first step is to explore in simulation the feasibility of translating decoding algorithms for brain-machine interface (BMI) applications into spiking neural networks (SNNs).   MAIN RESULTS Here we demonstrate the validity of the approach by implementing an existing Kalman-filter-based decoder in a simulated SNN using the Neural Engineering Framework (NEF), a general method for mapping control algorithms onto SNNs. To measure this system's robustness and generalization, we tested it online in closed-loop BMI experiments with two rhesus monkeys. Across both monkeys, a Kalman filter implemented using a 2000-neuron SNN has comparable performance to that of a Kalman filter implemented using standard floating point techniques.   SIGNIFICANCE These results demonstrate the tractability of SNN implementations of statistical signal processing algorithms on different monkeys and for several tasks, suggesting that a SNN decoder, implemented on a neuromorphic chip, may be a feasible computational platform for low-power fully-implanted prostheses. The validation of this closed-loop decoder system and the demonstration of its robustness and generalization hold promise for SNN implementations on an ultra-low power neuromorphic chip using the NEF.","",""

The spiking CNN consists of a convolutional/pooling layer followed by a feature discovery layer, both of which undergo bio-inspired learning. Kernels for the convolutional layer are trained using a sparse, spiking auto-encoder representing primary visual features.

Based on many known properties of cortical neurons, hierarchical temporal memory (HTM) sequence memory recently has been proposed as a theoretical framework for sequence learning in the cortex. In this letter, we analyze properties of HTM sequence memory and apply it to sequence learning and prediction problems with streaming data. We show the model is able to continuously learn a large number of variable order temporal sequences using an unsupervised Hebbian-like learning rule. The sparse temporal codes formed by the model can robustly handle branching temporal sequences by maintaining multiple predictions until there is sufficient disambiguating evidence. We compare the HTM sequence memory with other sequence learning algorithms, including statistical methods—autoregressive integrated moving average; feedforward neural networks—time delay neural network and online sequential extreme learning machine; and recurrent neural networks—long short-term memory and echo-state networks on sequence prediction problems with both artificial and real-world data. The HTM model achieves comparable accuracy to other state-of-the-art algorithms. The model also exhibits properties that are critical for sequence learning, including continuous online learning, the ability to handle multiple predictions and branching sequences with high-order statistics, robustness to sensor noise and fault tolerance, and good performance without task-specific hyperparameter tuning. Therefore, the HTM sequence memory not only advances our understanding of how the brain may solve the sequence learning problem but is also applicable to real-world sequence learning problems from continuous data streams.","",""

There are computational models on translation and expansion/contraction perceptions; however, little has been done in the past to create computational models for rotational motion perception. To fill this gap, we proposed a neural network that utilizes a specific spatiotemporal arrangement of asymmetric lateral inhibited direction selective neural networks (DSNNs) for rotational motion perception. The proposed neural network consists of two parts—presynaptic and postsynaptic parts. In the presynaptic part, there are a number of lateral inhibited DSNNs to extract directional visual cues. In the postsynaptic part, similar to the arrangement of the directional columns in the cerebral cortex, these direction selective neurons are arranged in a cyclic order to perceive rotational motion cues. In the postsynaptic network, the delayed excitation from each direction selective neuron is multiplied by the gathered excitation from this neuron and its unilateral counterparts depending on which rotation, clockwise (cw) or counter-cw (ccw), to perceive. Systematic experiments under various conditions and settings have been carried out and validated the robustness and reliability of the proposed neural network in detecting cw or ccw rotational motion.

Unfortunately, the naive trading schemes typically involves potential risks related to copyright and trustworthiness issues, e.g., a sold model can be illegally resold to others without further authorization to reap huge profits. To tackle this problem, various watermarking techniques are proposed to protect the model intellectual property, amongst which the backdoor-based watermarking is the most commonly-used one. However, the robustness of these watermarking approaches is not well evaluated under realistic settings, such as limited in-distribution data availability and agnostic of watermarking patterns.

The proposed WILD removes the watermarks of deep models with only a small portion of training data, and the output model can perform the same as models trained from scratch without watermarks injected. In particular, a novel data augmentation method is utilized to mimic the behavior of watermark triggers. Combining with the distribution alignment between the normal and perturbed (e.g., occluded) data in the feature space, our approach generalizes well on all typical types of trigger contents.

It is based on an architecture of ON and OFF visual pathways underlies a theory of splitting motion signals into parallel channels, encoding brightness increments and decrements separately. To enhance the edge selectivity and speed response to moving objects, we put forth a bio-plausible spatial-temporal network structure with multiple connections of same polarity ON/OFF cells. Each pair-wised combination is filtered with dynamic delay depending on sampling distance. The proposed vision system was challenged against image streams from both synthetic and cluttered real physical scenarios. The results demonstrated three major contributions: first, the neural network fulfilled the characteristics of a postulated physiological map of conveying visual information through different neuropile layers; second, the DSNs model can extract useful directional motion cues from cluttered background robustly and timely, which hits at potential of quick implementation in vision-based micro mobile robots; moreover, it also represents better speed response compared to a state-of-the-art elementary motion detector.","",""

In this paper, the nonparametric neural network-based prediction intervals (PIs) are implemented for forecast uncertainty quantification. Instead of a single level PI, wind power forecast uncertainties are represented in a list of PIs. These PIs are then decomposed into quantiles of wind power. A new scenario generation method is proposed to handle wind power forecast uncertainties. For each hour, an empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) is fitted to these quantile points. The Monte Carlo simulation method is used to generate scenarios from the ECDF. Then the wind power scenarios are incorporated into a stochastic security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) model. The heuristic genetic algorithm is utilized to solve the stochastic SCUC problem. Five deterministic and four stochastic case studies incorporated with interval forecasts of wind power are implemented. The results of these cases are presented and discussed together. Generation costs, and the scheduled and real-time economic dispatch reserves of different unit commitment strategies are compared. The experimental results show that the stochastic model is more robust than deterministic ones and, thus, decreases the risk in system operations of smart grids.","",""

Due to the dynamic feature of the NARMA model, a recurrent neural network (RNN) is online applied to learn it. However, the system performance becomes deteriorated due to the poor learning of the larger variation of system vector functions. In this situation, a simple network is employed to compensate the upper bound of the residue caused by the linear parameterization of the approximation error of RNN. An e-modification learning law with a projection for weight matrix is applied to guarantee its boundedness without persistent excitation.

It can even memorize randomly labeled data, which has little knowledge behind the instance-label pairs. When a deep network continually learns over time by accommodating new tasks, it usually quickly overwrites the knowledge learned from previous tasks. Referred to as the neural variability, it is well known in neuroscience that human brain reactions exhibit substantial variability even in response to the same stimulus. This mechanism balances accuracy and plasticity/flexibility in the motor learning of natural nervous systems. Thus, it motivates us to design a similar mechanism, named artificial neural variability (ANV), that helps artificial neural networks learn some advantages from “natural” neural networks. We rigorously prove that ANV plays as an implicit regularizer of the mutual information between the training data and the learned model. This result theoretically guarantees ANV a strictly improved generalizability, robustness to label noise, and robustness to catastrophic forgetting. We then devise a neural variable risk minimization (NVRM) framework and neural variable optimizers to achieve ANV for conventional network architectures in practice. The empirical studies demonstrate that NVRM can effectively relieve overfitting, label noise memorization, and catastrophic forgetting at negligible costs.","",""

The proposed framework uses the first-order Taylor series approximation to propagate and learn the first two moments (mean and covariance) of the distribution of the model parameters given the training data by maximizing the evidence lower bound. The output consists of two maps: the segmented image and the uncertainty map of the segmentation. The uncertainty in the segmentation decisions is captured by the covariance matrix of the predictive distribution. We evaluate the proposed framework on medical image segmentation data from Magnetic Resonances Imaging and Computed Tomography scans. Our experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework is more robust to noise and adversarial attacks as compared to state-of-the-art segmentation models. Moreover, the uncertainty map of the proposed framework associates low confidence (or equivalently high uncertainty) to patches in the test input images that are corrupted with noise, artifacts or adversarial attacks. Thus, the model can self-assess its segmentation decisions when it makes an erroneous prediction or misses part of the segmentation structures, e.g., tumor, by presenting higher values in the uncertainty map.","",""

However, it is a long-standing challenging problem for artificial agents. Cognitive autonomous robots coping with this problem must solve two essential tasks: 1) understand the environment in terms of what may happen and how I can deal with this and 2) learn successful experiences for their further use in an automatic subconscious way. The recently introduced concept of compact internal representation (CIR) provides the ground for both the tasks. CIR is a specific cognitive map that compacts time-evolving situations into static structures containing information necessary for navigation. It belongs to the class of global approaches, i.e., it finds trajectories to a target when they exist but also detects situations when no solution can be found. Here we extend the concept of situations with mobile targets. Then using CIR as a core, we propose a closed-loop neural network architecture consisting of conscious and subconscious pathways for efficient decision-making. The conscious pathway provides solutions to novel situations if the default subconscious pathway fails to guide the agent to a target. Employing experiments with roving robots and numerical simulations, we show that the proposed architecture provides the robot with cognitive abilities and enables reliable and flexible navigation in realistic time-evolving environments. We prove that the subconscious pathway is robust against uncertainty in the sensory information. Thus if a novel situation is similar but not identical to the previous experience (because of, e.g., noisy perception) then the subconscious pathway is able to provide an effective solution.","",""

We trained an excitatory-inhibitory RNN to learn neural sequences in a supervised manner and studied the representations and dynamic attractors of the trained network. The trained RNN was robust to trigger the sequence in response to various input signals and interpolated a time-warped input for sequence representation. Interestingly, a learned sequence can repeat periodically when the RNN evolved beyond the duration of a single sequence. The eigenspectrum of the learned recurrent connectivity matrix with growing or damping modes, together with the RNN's nonlinearity, were adequate to generate a limit cycle attractor. We further examined the stability of dynamic attractors while training the RNN to learn two sequences. Together, our results provide a general framework for understanding neural sequence representation in the excitatory-inhibitory RNN.","",""

In a BCI-aided epilepsy treatment system, therapic electrical stimulus is delivered in response to the prediction of upcoming seizure onsets, therefore timely and accurate seizure prediction algorithm plays an important role. However, unlike typical signatures such as slow or sharp waves in ictal periods, the signal patterns in preictal periods are usually subtle, and highly individual-dependent. How to extract effective and robust preictal features is still a challenging problem. Most recently, graph convolutional neural network (GCNN) has demonstrated the strength in the electroencephalogram (EEG) and intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) signal modeling, due to its advantages in describing complex relationships among different EEG/iEEG regions. However, current GCNN models are not suitable for seizure prediction. The effectiveness of GCNNs highly relies on prior graphs that describe the underlying relationships in EEG regions. However, due to the complex mechanism of seizure evolution, the underlying relationship in the preictal period can be diverse in different patients, making it almost impossible to build a proper prior graph in general. To deal with this problem, we propose a novel approach to automatically learn a patient-specific graph in a data-driven way, which is called the joint graph structure and representation learning network (JGRN). JGRN constructs a global-local graph convolutional neural network which jointly learns the graph structures and connection weights in a task-related learning process in iEEG signals, thus the learned graph and feature representations can be optimized toward the objective of seizure prediction. Experimental results show that our JGRN outperforms CNN and GCNN models remarkably, and the improvement is more obvious when preictal features are subtle.","",""

In this paper, two learning techniques are independently introduced which use BL for improving robustness to white noise static and adversarial examples. The first method is bidirectional propagation of errors, which the error propagation occurs in backward and forward directions.

Our method allows nonconvex sets for projection operations, and control error does not accumulate over time in the presence of noise.

However, the adoption of data-driven approaches in many clinical settings has been hampered due to their inability to perform in a reliable and safe manner to leverage accurate and trustworthy diagnoses. A critical and challenging usage scenario for AI is aiding the treatment of cancerous conditions. Providing accurate diagnosis for cancer is a challenging problem in precision oncology. Although machine learning (ML)-based approaches are very effective at cancer susceptibility prediction and subsequent treatment recommendations, ML models can be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Since adversarially weak models can lead to wrong clinical recommendations, such vulnerabilities is critical – especially when AI-guided systems are used to aid medical doctors. Therefore, it is indispensable that healthcare professionals employ trustworthy AI tools for predicting and assessing disease risks and progression. In this paper, we propose an adversary-aware multimodal convolutional autoencoder (MCAE) model for cancer susceptibility prediction from multi-omics data consisting of copy number variations (CNVs), miRNA expression, and gene expression (GE). Based on different representational learning techniques, the MCAE model learns multimodal feature representations from multi-omics data, followed by classifying the patient cohorts into different cancer types on multimodal embedding space that exhibit similar characteristics in end-to-end setting. To make the MCAE model robust to adversaries and to provide consistent diagnosis, we formulate robustness as a property, such that predictions remain stable with regard to small variations in the input. We study different adversarial attacks scenarios and take both proactive and reactive measures (e.g., adversarial retraining and identification of adversarial inputs). Experiment results show that the MCAE model based on latent representation concatenation (LRC) exhibits high confidence at predicting cancer types, giving an average precision and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) scores of 0.9625 and 0.8453, respectively and shows higher robustness when compared with state-of-the-art approaches against different attack scenarios w.r.t.

The dynamics, however, are assumed to be corrupted by perturbations modeling the error, which might be incurred due to limitations of the biology, intrinsic neuronal noise, and imperfect measurements. We show that error, and the associated uncertainty surrounding a learned solution, can be controlled in large part by trading off synchronization strength among multiple redundant neural systems against the noise amplitude. The impact of the coupling between such redundant systems is quantified by the spectrum of the network Laplacian, and we discuss the role of network topology in synchronization and in reducing the effect of noise. We discuss range of situations in which the mechanisms we model arise in brain science and draw attention to experimental evidence suggesting that cortical circuits capable of implementing the computations of interest here can be found on several scales.
