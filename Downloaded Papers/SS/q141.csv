Specifically, to improve the capacity of learning transition probability of the network throughput, we adopt a BNN-based predictor that is able to predict the statistical distribution of future throughput from the past throughput by not only considering the aleatoric uncertainty (e.g., noise), but also capturing the epistemic uncertainty incurred by lack of adequate training samples. We further show that by using the negative log-likelihood loss function to train this BNN-based throughput predictor, the generalization error can be minimized with the guarantee of PAC-Bayesian theorem. Rather than a point estimate, the learnt uncertainty can contribute to a confidence region for the future throughput, the lower bound of which then leads to an uncertainty-aware robust MPC strategy to maximize the worst-case user quality-of-experience (QoE) w.r.t. this confidence region. Finally, experimental results on three real-world network trace datasets validate the efficiency of both the proposed BNN-based predictor and uncertainty-aware robust MPC strategy, and demonstrate the superior performance compared to other baselines, in terms of both the overall QoE performance and generalization across all ranges of heterogeneous network and user conditions.","",""

We propose a deep learning strategy for detection and classification of objects on the pipeline right of ways by analyzing aerial images captured by flying aircrafts or drones. Due to the limitation of sufficient aerial datasets for accurately training the deep learning systems, it is necessary to create an efficient methodology for object data augmentation of the training dataset to achieve robust performance in various environmental conditions. Another limitation is the computing hardware that could be installed on the aircraft, especially when it is a drone. Hence a balance between the effectiveness and efficiency of object detector needs to be considered. We propose an efficient weighted IOU NMS (intersection over union non-maxima suppression) method to speed up the post-processing time that satisfies the onboard processing requirement. Weighted IOU NMS utilizes confidence scores of all proposed bounding boxes to regenerate a mean box in parallel. It processes the bounding box score at the same instant without removing the bounding box or decreasing the bounding box score. We perform both quantitative and qualitative evaluations of our network architecture on multiple aerial datasets. The experimental results show that our proposed framework achieves better accuracy than the state-of-the-art methods for aerial object detection in various environmental conditions.","",""

Being trained on proprietary information, these models provide a competitive edge for the owner company. At the same time, these models can be attractive to competitors (or malicious entities), which can employ state-of-the-art security attacks to obtain and use these models for their benefit.

It should be pointed out that the existing training strategies assume that there is a clean dataset for model learning. In elaborately constructed benchmark datasets, deep network has yielded promising performance under the assumption. However, in real-world applications, it is burdensome and expensive to collect sufficient clean training samples. On the other hand, collecting noisy labeled samples is very economical and practical, especially with the rapidly increasing amount of visual data in the web. Unfortunately, the accuracy of current deep models may drop dramatically even with 5%–10% label noise. Therefore, enabling label noise resistant classification has become a crucial issue in the data driven deep learning approaches. In this paper, we propose a DEep COnfiDEnce network (DECODE) to address this issue. In particular, based on the distribution of mislabeled data, we adopt a confidence evaluation module that is able to determine the confidence that a sample is mislabeled. With the confidence, we further use a weighting strategy to assign different weights to different samples so that the model pays less attention to low confidence data, which is more likely to be noise. In this way, the deep model is more robust to label noise. DECODE is designed to be general, such that it can be easily combined with existing studies. We conduct extensive experiments on several datasets, and the results validate that DECODE can improve the accuracy of deep models trained with noisy data.","",""

However, beyond accuracy, the robustness of the learned student network against perturbation is also essential for practical uses. Existing teacher-student learning frameworks mainly focus on accuracy and compression ratios, but ignore the robustness.

However, there is still a need for further demonstration of their ability in flood forecasting in order to build enough confidence for their application in practice. Among the aims of developing forecasting models, is utilizing them as a decision support system. To ensure applicability of the system for real-world application, limitations of the model should be outlined.

The few-shot robustness analysis evaluation of FROB on different image sets and on One-Class Classification (OCC) data shows that FROB achieves competitive state-of-the-art performance and outperforms benchmarks in terms of robustness to the outlier OoD few-shot sample population and variability.","",""

DRL can be naturally formulated as a competitive two-player game between a predictor and an adversary that is allowed to corrupt the labels, subject to certain constraints, and reduces to incorporating a density ratio between the source and target domains (under the standard log loss). This formulation motivates the use of two neural networks that are jointly trained - a discriminative network between the source and target domains for density-ratio estimation, in addition to the standard classification network. The use of a density ratio in DRL prevents the model from being overconfident on target inputs far away from the source domain. Thus, DRL provides conservative confidence estimation in the target domain, even when the target labels are not available. This conservatism motivates the use of DRL in self-training for sample selection, and we term the approach distributionally robust self-training (DRST). In our experiments, DRST generates more calibrated probabilities and achieves state-of-the-art self-training accuracy on benchmark datasets. We demonstrate that DRST captures shape features more effectively, and reduces the extent of distributional shift during self-training.","",""

Further implementations on two probabilistic base classifiers and two large deep learning architecture in vision tasks further confirm that the method is robust and scalable.

Face image forgery detection has made considerable progresses in exposing specific FIM, but it is still in scarcity of a robust fake face detector to expose face image forgeries under complex scenarios. Due to the relatively fixed structure, convolutional neural network (CNN) tends to learn image content representations. However, CNN should learn subtle tampering artifacts for image forensics tasks. We propose an adaptive residuals extraction network (AREN), which serves as pre-processing to suppress image content and highlight tampering artifacts. AREN exploits an adaptive convolution layer to predict image residuals, which are reused in subsequent layers to maximize manipulation artifacts by updating weights during the back-propagation pass. A fake face detector, namely ARENnet, is constructed by integrating AREN with CNN. Experimental results prove that the proposed AREN achieves desirable pre-processing. When detecting fake face images generated by various FIM techniques, ARENnet achieves an average accuracy up to 98.52%, which outperforms the state-of-the-art works. When detecting face images with unknown post-processing operations, the detector also achieves an average accuracy of 95.17%.","",""

In this paper, we show how robust neural networks can be trained using random projection. We show that while random projection acts as a strong regularizer, boosting model accuracy similar to other regularizers, such as weight decay and dropout, it is far more robust to adversarial noise and fooling samples. We further show that random projection also helps to improve the robustness of traditional classifiers, such as Random Forrest and Gradient Boosting Machines.","",""

A plethora of work has demonstrated that it is easy to find or synthesize inputs for which a neural network is highly confident yet wrong. Generative models are widely viewed to be robust to such mistaken confidence as modeling the density of the input features can be used to detect novel, out-of-distribution inputs. In this paper we challenge this assumption. We find that the density learned by flow-based models, VAEs, and PixelCNNs cannot distinguish images of common objects such as dogs, trucks, and horses (i.e. CIFAR-10) from those of house numbers (i.e. SVHN), assigning a higher likelihood to the latter when the model is trained on the former. Moreover, we find evidence of this phenomenon when pairing several popular image data sets: FashionMNIST vs MNIST, CelebA vs SVHN, ImageNet vs CIFAR-10 / CIFAR-100 / SVHN. To investigate this curious behavior, we focus analysis on flow-based generative models in particular since they are trained and evaluated via the exact marginal likelihood. We find such behavior persists even when we restrict the flows to constant-volume transformations. These transformations admit some theoretical analysis, and we show that the difference in likelihoods can be explained by the location and variances of the data and the model curvature. Our results caution against using the density estimates from deep generative models to identify inputs similar to the training distribution until their behavior for out-of-distribution inputs is better understood.","",""

Although mammals basically integrate all sensory inputs, sometimes they ignore a part of the sensory input if the input is very noisy or contradicted from other sensory inputs. Using such adaptive selection strategy, mammals realize robust recognition in any situation. To realize the above in artificial neural networks, we construct a Bayesian method for optimizing the recognition outputs using several sets of forward network and backward network connected to each sensor. In the recognition phase, the system calculates the posterior distribution of the recognition output and the confidence parameter of each sensor, and optimizes the output and the confidence parameter to maximize the posterior distribution function. The repetition of the forward and the backward network calculation realizes the optimization process quickly. The experimental results show that the system yields appropriate recognition results while ignoring the noisy or contradictive sensory inputs by decreasing the corresponding confidence parameter.","",""

We theoretically analyze approximate Gaussian distributions on the weights of ReLU networks and show that they fix the overconfidence problem. Furthermore, we show that even a simplistic, thus cheap, Bayesian approximation, also fixes these issues. This indicates that a sufficient condition for a calibrated uncertainty on a ReLU network is ""to be a bit Bayesian"".

In this way, the image-level labels are iteratively transferred to instance-level labels. We aim to resolve the following two fundamental problems within this paradigm. First, existing proposal generation algorithms are not yet robust, thus the object proposals are often inaccurate. Second, the selected positive instances are sometimes noisy and unreliable, which hinders the training at subsequent iterations. We adopt two separate neural networks, one to focus on each problem, to better utilize the specific characteristic of region proposal refinement and positive instance selection. Further, to leverage the mutual benefits of the two tasks, the two neural networks are jointly trained and reinforced iteratively in a progressive manner, starting with easy and reliable instances and then gradually incorporating difficult ones at a later stage when the selection classifier is more robust.

An obvious advantage of artificial neural networks is that the models are nonlinear and relatively easy to train. Shortcomings of the neural network literature for time series forecasting include (i) the lack of consensus for parameter settings; (ii) a lack of established standards for training neural networks; (iii) a lack of consistent evaluation metrics for time series forecasting; and (iv) a lack of clearly established benchmark problems.

We exhibit the merits of our approach in a number of applications, considering both benchmark datasets and real-world applications, where we show that our method offers a significant enhancement in the dynamical data modeling capabilities of ESNs. Additionally, we also show that our method is orders of magnitude more computationally efficient compared to existing Gaussian process-based methods for dynamical data modeling, without compromises in the obtained predictive performance.","",""

In this paper, four approaches to evidence combination are presented and compared using realistic oceanic data. The first method uses an entropy-based weighting of individual classifier outputs. The second is based on combination of confidence factors in a manner similar to that used in MYCIN. The other two methods are majority voting and averaging, with little extra computational overhead.

Several neural networks were applied and compared to interpret well logs, including layer picking, forward simulation, and inversion.  A modular neural network was trained to extract the layer boundaries from a single unfocused tool response. The network showed the capability to pick layer boundaries but the confidence level was not uniformly high.  Five different networks were trained with multiple tool responses to pick the layer boundaries. The results showed that the modular neural network and resilient back-propagation network could produce the most accurate results. The picked layer boundaries using multiple tool responses were located at a higher confidence level and less noise than using a single response tool.  Fast forward modeling was performed with a modular neural network. The trained neural networks indicated that the modular neural network could predict the forward responses with an average accuracy of above 95%. An error analysis suggested that the neural network errors could be approximately described by a Gaussian distribution. A sensitivity test was also investigated to analyze how the errors would propagate back to the formation resistivity estimations. Larger errors were produced in conductive and thin layers, but smaller errors in thick layers.  A pattern recognition-based fast forward modeling was developed.

The FTM implements a RAM-based neural network, using three knowledge bases. In addition, a majority voting technique is used to improve the confidence level in the recognition step. A number of experiments using a prototype implementation and selected gestures resulted in a rate of 100% true recognition. The system also showed to be robust, and flexible as new gesture patterns can be easily included by means of the on-chip training capabilities.

Safer autonomous navigation might be very challenging if there is a failure in sensing system. Among several sensing systems, image classification plays a major role in understanding the road signs and to regulate the vehicle control based on urban road rules. Hence, a robust classifier algorithm irrespective of camera position, view angles, environmental condition, different vehicle size & type (Car, Bus, Truck, etc.,) of an autonomous platform is of prime importance. In this study, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based classifier algorithm has been implemented to ensure improved robustness for recognizing traffic signs. As training data play a crucial role in supervised learning algorithms, there come an effective dataset requirement which can handle dynamic environmental conditions and other variations caused due to the vehicle motion (will be referred as challenges). Since the collected training data might not contain all the dynamic variations, the model weakness can be identified by exposing it to variations (Blur, Darkness, Shadow, etc.,) faced by the vehicles in real-time as a initial testing sequence. To overcome the weakness caused due to the training data itself, an effective augmentation technique enriching the training data in order to increase the model capacity for withstanding the variations prevalent in urban environment has been proposed. As a major contribution, a framework has been developed to identify model weakness and successively introduce a targeted augmentation methodology for classification improvement. Targeted augmentation is based on estimated weakness caused due to the challenges with difficulty levels, only those necessary for better classification were then augmented further. Predictive Augmentation (PA) and Predictive Multiple Augmentation (PMA) are the two proposed methods to adapt the model based on targeted challenges by delivering with high numerical value of confidence.

Here, we propose two methods to construct a deep learning framework that exhibits superior performance with a small labeled dataset. Results At first, we use transfer learning in encoding protein sequences with a pretrained model, which trains general sequence representations in an unsupervised manner. Second, we use a Bayesian neural network to make a robust model by estimating the data uncertainty. Our resulting model performs better than the previous baselines at predicting interactions between molecules and proteins. We also show that the quantified uncertainty from the Bayesian inference is related to confidence and can be used for screening DPI data points.

This phenomenon is well recognized in recent researches that the model tends to become overparameterized when the networks get more complex. Diverse regularization techniques have been developed such as L2 regularization, Dropout, DisturbLabel (DL) to prevent overfitting. DL, a newcomer on the scene, regularizes the loss layer by flipping a small share of the target labels at random and training the neural network on this distorted data so as to not learn the training data. It is observed that high confidence labels during training cause the overfitting problem and DL selects disturb labels at random regardless of the confidence of labels.

This active regularization makes use of the model behavior during training to regularize it in a more directed manner.

To the best of our knowledge, however, the simultaneous design of proper number of hidden neurons, and specific forms of hidden‐ and output‐layer transfer functions has not yet been reported in terms of the Bayesian neural network. It is even more challenging when the transfer functions of both layers are parameterized instead of using fixed shape forms. This paper proposes a tailor‐made algorithm for efficiently designing the appropriate architecture of Bayesian neural network with simultaneously optimized hidden neuron number and custom transfer functions in both hidden and output layers. To cooperate with the proposed algorithm, both the Jacobian of the network function and Hessian of the negative logarithm of weight posterior are derived analytically by matrix calculus. This is much more accurate and efficient than the finite difference approximation, and also vital for properly designing the Bayesian neural network architecture as well as further quantifying the confidence interval of network prediction. The validity and efficiency of the proposed methodology is verified through probabilistic finite element (FE) model updating of a pedestrian bridge by using the field measurement data.","",""

Samples with high confidence of each classification result will be used as the training samples of the next training. Then, a semi-supervised model is obtained for PolSAR image classification. This model is independent of the dependence of supervised classification on manual calibration samples. Furthermore, the model is an end-to-end classification framework based on discriminative feature learning which can learn the spatial texture features of polarized SAR images automatically while performing convolution operations in CNN. In addition, this model tries to learn features that are beneficial to classification from highly confident samples. There are three advantages of the proposed model: firstly, the problem of small samples is solved by increasing the training samples from each iterative classification result. Secondly, the low confidence samples are removed in each iteration to reduce the impact of noise samples on the robustness of the model. Finally, the initialization of CNN parameters in each iteration process is based on the results of the previous learning. As a result, the parameters will be set more and more robustly, so that the entire model will not have poor performance due to random initialization.","",""

Two key issues are discovered: (1) Self LC is the most appealing as it exploits its own knowledge and requires no extra models. However, how to automatically decide the trust degree of a learner as training goes is not well answered in the literature? (2) Some methods penalise while the others reward low-entropy predictions, prompting us to ask which one is better?To resolve the first issue, taking two well-accepted propositions–deep neural networks learn meaningful patterns before fitting noise [3] and minimum entropy regularisation principle [10]–we propose a novel end-to-end method named ProSelfLC, which is designed according to learning time and entropy. Specifically, given a data point, we progressively increase trust in its predicted label distribution versus its annotated one if a model has been trained for enough time and the prediction is of low entropy (high confidence). For the second issue, according to ProSelfLC, we empirically prove that it is better to redefine a meaningful low-entropy status and optimise the learner toward it. This serves as a defence of entropy minimisation.We demonstrate the effectiveness of ProSelfLC through extensive experiments in both clean and noisy settings.

It consists of training an undirected neural network to map input to output and vice-versa; therefore it can produce a classifier in one direction, and a generator in the opposite direction for the same data. The learning process of BL tries to reproduce the neuroplasticity stated in Hebbian theory using only backward propagation of errors. In this paper, two learning techniques are independently introduced which use BL for improving robustness to white noise static and adversarial examples. The first method is bidirectional propagation of errors, which the error propagation occurs in backward and forward directions. Motivated by the fact that its generative model receives as input a constant vector per class, we introduce as a second method the novel hybrid adversarial networks (HAN). Its generative model receives a random vector as input and its training is based on generative adversarial networks (GAN). To assess the performance of BL, we perform experiments using several architectures with fully and convolutional layers, with and without bias. Experimental results show that both methods improve robustness to white noise static and adversarial examples, and even increase accuracy, but have different behavior depending on the architecture and task, being more beneficial to use the one or the other. Nevertheless, HAN using a convolutional architecture with batch normalization presents outstanding robustness, reaching state-of-the-art accuracy on adversarial examples of hand-written digits.","",""

Posterior confidence has been widely used and was verified to be effective. In some previous works, the optimization of posterior confidence has been proposed, which linearly transforms the phone-level confidence into the word-level confidence. On this basis, we propose a neural network based method that make a non-linear transformation. In addition, a sparse activation and back-propagation strategy is proposed to make this method feasible and work fast. In the experiments, the proposed method is compared to other two previous methods. To evaluate performance, two most commonly used measures are considered: AUC and EER. The experimental result shows that the proposed method is effective and achieved the best performance among three methods.","",""

Unfortunately, they are unlikely to have a sufficiently flexible functional form to be able to adequately model realworld phenomena, and their usage may therefore result in biased estimates and invalid inference. Unfortunately, whilst non-parametric machine learning models may provide the needed flexibility to adapt to the complexity of realworld phenomena, they do not readily facilitate statistical inference, and may still exhibit residual bias. We explore the potential for semiparametric theory (in particular, the Influence Function) to be used to improve neural networks and machine learning algorithms in terms of (a) improving initial estimates without needing more data (b) increasing the robustness of our models, and (c) yielding confidence intervals for statistical inference. We propose a new neural network method ‘MultiNet’, which seeks the flexibility and diversity of an ensemble using a single architecture. Results on causal inference tasks indicate that MultiNet yields better performance than other approaches, and that all considered methods are amenable to improvement from semiparametric techniques under certain conditions. In other words, with these techniques we show that we can improve existing neural networks for ‘free’, without needing more data, and without needing to retrain them. Finally, we provide the expression for deriving influence functions for estimands from a general graph, and the code to do so automatically.","",""

In the era of industrial big data, numerous deep learning (DL)-based methods have been proposed to achieve these goals. However, in complex and dynamic manufacturing processes, practical concerns such as uncertainty quantification and anti-noise capabilities of the DL-based methods are rarely considered. Thus, in this study, a novel multi-branch Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) is developed for the reliable and robust online health monitoring of Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machine tools. With the proposed model, the heterogeneous fault information extracted from multiple sensors can be simultaneously integrated in a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN)-multiple layer perceptron (MLP)-based multi-branch neural network to enhance the health monitoring accuracy and robustness. Furthermore, the proposed multi-branch neural network is extended into a BNN to improve its uncertainty quantification capabilities. The proposed method is evaluated on the tool wear tests of three cutting tools. Tool wear estimation results indicate that the proposed method outperforms comparative methods and achieves the best prediction accuracy and robustness on all three health monitoring tasks investigated in this study. We also found that the proposed method can accurately classify tool wear stages and reach up to 95% mean classification accuracy, which is the best among comparative methods. Also, measures, such as coverage probability of estimation interval (EICP) and normalized mean estimation interval width (NMEIW), are used to assess the capability of quantifying the confidence intervals (CIs) of the tool wear estimations. Results show that the proposed method achieves superior CIs quantification performance with the average EICP and NMEIW values of 95.77% and 0.27 on all three health monitoring tasks.","",""

In this work, we introduce two new techniques based on Bayesian theory (knowledge-driven) and artificial neural network (data-driven) for fault diagnosis in nuclear power plants. The first approach exploits an integrated technique, Bayesian Neural Network (BNN), which introduces Bayesian theory into the neural network to provide confidence in diagnosis. The second approach, denoted as Simplified Bayesian Network-Artificial Neural Network (SBN-ANN), adopts a hierarchical diagnosis idea, which firstly uses a simplified Bayesian network to diagnose fault types and then a neural network to diagnose the severity of faults. The two new techniques are implemented and verified with simulated faults data of a typical pressurized water reactor. Compared with single-algorithmic diagnostic approaches such as Bayesian network and neural network, the new combinatorial techniques show better performance in diagnostic precision. The results suggest the feasibility to develop the data and knowledge dual-drive technologies for fault diagnosis.","",""
