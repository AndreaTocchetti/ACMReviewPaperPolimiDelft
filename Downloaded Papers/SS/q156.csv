Classification of electroencephalography (EEG)-based motor imagery (MI) is a crucial non-invasive application in brain–computer interface (BCI) research. This paper proposes a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for accurate and robust EEG-based MI classification that outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Approach. The proposed CNN model, namely EEG-inception, is built on the backbone of the inception-time network, which has showed to be highly efficient and accurate for time-series classification. Also, the proposed network is an end-to-end classification, as it takes the raw EEG signals as the input and does not require complex EEG signal-preprocessing. Furthermore, this paper proposes a novel data augmentation method for EEG signals to enhance the accuracy, at least by 3%, and reduce overfitting with limited BCI datasets. Main results. The proposed model outperforms all state-of-the-art methods by achieving the average accuracy of 88.4% and 88.6% on the 2008 BCI Competition IV 2a (four-classes) and 2b datasets (binary-classes), respectively. Furthermore, it takes less than 0.025 s to test a sample suitable for real-time processing. Moreover, the classification standard deviation for nine different subjects achieves the lowest value of 5.5 for the 2b dataset and 7.1 for the 2a dataset, which validates that the proposed method is highly robust. Significance. From the experiment results, it can be inferred that the EEG-inception network exhibits a strong potential as a subject-independent classifier for EEG-based MI tasks.","",""

To simultaneously enhance the convergence performance and robustness, this article proposes a new ZNN model by using a supertwisting (ST) algorithm, termed STZNN model, for the tracking control of mobile robot manipulators. The proposed STZNN model inherently possesses the advantages of finite-time convergence and robustness making the control process fast and robust. The bridge from the sliding mode control to the ZNN is built, and the essential connection between the ST algorithm and ZNN is explored by constructing a unified design process.

APPROACH A Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) deep neural network has been trained to deal with time-dependent information within brain signals during locomotion. The EEG signals have been preprocessed by means of Artifacts Subspace Reconstruction (ASR) and Reliable Independent Component Analysis (RELICA) to ensure that classification performance was not affected by movement-related artifacts.   MAIN RESULT The network was evaluated on the dataset of 11 healthy subjects walking on a treadmill. The proposed decoding approach shows a robust reconstruction (AUC>90%) of gait patterns (i.e., swing and stance states) of both legs together, or of each leg independently.   SIGNIFICANCE Our results support for the first time the use of a memory-based deep learning classifier to decode walking activity from non-invasive brain recordings. We suggest that this classifier, exploited in real time, can be a more effective input for devices restoring locomotion in impaired people.","",""

However, current GCNN models are not suitable for seizure prediction. The effectiveness of GCNNs highly relies on prior graphs that describe the underlying relationships in EEG regions. However, due to the complex mechanism of seizure evolution, the underlying relationship in the preictal period can be diverse in different patients, making it almost impossible to build a proper prior graph in general. To deal with this problem, we propose a novel approach to automatically learn a patient-specific graph in a data-driven way, which is called the joint graph structure and representation learning network (JGRN). JGRN constructs a global-local graph convolutional neural network which jointly learns the graph structures and connection weights in a task-related learning process in iEEG signals, thus the learned graph and feature representations can be optimized toward the objective of seizure prediction. Experimental results show that our JGRN outperforms CNN and GCNN models remarkably, and the improvement is more obvious when preictal features are subtle.","",""

The characteristics of existing one-class labels lead to a dilemma: it is hard to directly use a multiple classifier based on deep neural networks to solve one-class classification problems. Therefore, in this article, we propose a novel DeepOC neural network, termed as DeepOC, which can simultaneously learn compact feature representations and train a DeepOC classifier. Only with the given normal samples, we use the stacked convolutional encoder to generate their low-dimensional high-level features and train a one-class classifier to make these features as compact as possible. Meanwhile, for the sake of the correct mapping relation and the feature representations’ diversity, we utilize a decoder in order to reconstruct raw samples from these low-dimensional feature representations. This structure is gradually established using an adversarial mechanism during the training stage. This mechanism is the key to our model. It organically combines two seemingly contradictory components and allows them to take advantage of each other, thus making the model robust and effective. Unlike methods that use handcrafted features or those that are separated into two stages (extracting features and training classifiers), DeepOC is a one-stage model using reliable features that are automatically extracted by neural networks. Experiments on various benchmark data sets show that DeepOC is feasible and achieves the state-of-the-art anomaly detection results compared with a dozen existing methods.","",""

However, various working requirements and the oceanic environment may cause some uncertain and unfavorable factors for ship-mounted crane control. In particular, to accomplish different control tasks, some plant parameters (e.g., boom lengths, payload masses, and so on) frequently change; hence, most existing model-based controllers cannot ensure satisfactory control performance any longer. For example, inaccurate gravity compensation may result in positioning errors. Additionally, due to ship roll motions caused by sea waves, residual payload swing generally exists, which may result in safety risks in practice. To solve the above-mentioned issues, this paper designs a neural network-based adaptive control method that can provide effective control for both actuated and unactuated state variables based on the original nonlinear ship-mounted crane dynamics without any linearizing operations. In particular, the proposed update law availably compensates parameter/structure uncertainties for ship-mounted crane systems. Based on a 2-D sliding surface, the boom and rope can arrive at their preset positions in finite time, and the payload swing can be completely suppressed. Furthermore, the problem of nonlinear input dead zones is also taken into account. The stability of the equilibrium point of all state variables in ship-mounted crane systems is theoretically proven by a rigorous Lyapunov-based analysis.

In this way, a portable student network with significantly fewer parameters can achieve considerable accuracy, which is comparable to that of a teacher network. However, beyond accuracy, the robustness of the learned student network against perturbation is also essential for practical uses. Existing teacher-student learning frameworks mainly focus on accuracy and compression ratios, but ignore the robustness. In this paper, we make the student network produce more confident predictions with the help of the teacher network, and analyze the lower bound of the perturbation that will destroy the confidence of the student network. Two important objectives regarding prediction scores and gradients of examples are developed to maximize this lower bound, to enhance the robustness of the student network without sacrificing the performance. Experiments on benchmark data sets demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach to learning robust student networks that have satisfying accuracy and compact sizes.","",""

Existing recognition methods rely on a threshold technique, which is difficult to realize high accuracy, i.e., simultaneously high true positive rate and low false positive rate. To address this issue, we proposed a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect IC and NC states in a SSVEP-BCI system for the first time. Specifically, the steady-state motion visual evoked potentials (SSMVEP) paradigm, which has been shown to induce less visual discomfort, was chosen as the experimental paradigm. Two processing pipelines were proposed for the detection of IC and NC states. The first one was using CNN as a multi-class classifier to discriminate between all the states in IC and NC state (FFT-CNN). The second one was using CNN to discriminate between IC and NC states, and using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to perform classification tasks within the IC (FFT-CNN-CCA). We demonstrated that both pipelines achieved a significant increase in accuracy for low-performance healthy participants when traditional algorithms such as CCA threshold were used. Furthermore, the FFT-CNN-CCA pipeline achieved better performance than the FFT-CNN pipeline based on the stroke patients’ data.

It is worth noting that there exist few results about FNNs with discontinuous activation functions, which is mainly because classical solutions and theories of differential equations cannot be applied in this case. Especially, there is no relevant finite-time stabilization research for such system, and this paper makes up for the gap. The existence of global solution under the framework of Filippov for such system is guaranteed by limiting discontinuous activation functions. According to set-valued analysis and Kakutani’s fixed point theorem, we obtain the existence of equilibrium point. In particular, based on differential inclusion theory and fractional Lyapunov stability theory, several new sufficient conditions are given to ensure finite-time stabilization via a novel discontinuous controller, and the upper bound of the settling time for stabilization is estimated. In addition, we analyze the finite-time stabilization of FNNs with Lipschitz-continuous activation functions under uncertainty. The results of this paper improve corresponding ones of integer-order neural networks with discontinuous and continuous activation functions. Finally, three numerical examples are given to show the effectiveness of the theoretical results.","",""

It is known that the disadvantages of robust control for the NARMA model are as follows: 1) suitable control parameters for larger time delay are more sensitive to achieving desirable performance; 2) it only deals with bounded uncertainty; and 3) the nominal NARMA model must be learned in advance. Due to the dynamic feature of the NARMA model, a recurrent neural network (RNN) is online applied to learn it. However, the system performance becomes deteriorated due to the poor learning of the larger variation of system vector functions. In this situation, a simple network is employed to compensate the upper bound of the residue caused by the linear parameterization of the approximation error of RNN. An e-modification learning law with a projection for weight matrix is applied to guarantee its boundedness without persistent excitation. Under suitable conditions, the semiglobally ultimately bounded tracking with the boundedness of estimated weight matrix is obtained by the proposed RNN-based multivariable adaptive control.

We also used white moving bars in order to localize the spatial position of the recorded cells. Then recorded spikes were smoothed with a Gaussian kernel and used as the output target when training a 3D CNN in a supervised way.

The spiking CNN consists of a convolutional/pooling layer followed by a feature discovery layer, both of which undergo bio-inspired learning. Kernels for the convolutional layer are trained using a sparse, spiking auto-encoder representing primary visual features. The feature discovery layer uses a probabilistic spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) learning rule. This layer represents complex visual features using WTA-thresholded, leaky, integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons. The new model is evaluated on the MNIST digit dataset using clean and noisy images. Intermediate results show that the convolutional layer is stack-admissible, enabling it to support a multi-layer learning architecture. The recognition performance for clean images is above 98%. This performance is accounted for by the independent and informative visual features extracted in a hierarchy of convolutional and feature discovery layers. The performance loss for recognizing the noisy images is in the range 0.1% to 8.5%. This level of performance loss indicates that the network is robust to additive noise.","",""

The recognition of these patterns is made difficult by their substantial variation in cadence and duration. The neural circuit behaviors used are similar to those associated with brain neural integrators. In the larger context described here, this kind of circuit becomes a building block of an entirely different computational algorithm for solving complex problems. While the network behavior is simulated in detail, a collective view is essential to understanding the results. A closed equation of motion for the collective variable describes an algorithm that quantitatively accounts for many aspects of the emergent network computation.

Based on many known properties of cortical neurons, hierarchical temporal memory (HTM) sequence memory recently has been proposed as a theoretical framework for sequence learning in the cortex. In this letter, we analyze properties of HTM sequence memory and apply it to sequence learning and prediction problems with streaming data. We show the model is able to continuously learn a large number of variable order temporal sequences using an unsupervised Hebbian-like learning rule. The sparse temporal codes formed by the model can robustly handle branching temporal sequences by maintaining multiple predictions until there is sufficient disambiguating evidence. We compare the HTM sequence memory with other sequence learning algorithms, including statistical methods—autoregressive integrated moving average; feedforward neural networks—time delay neural network and online sequential extreme learning machine; and recurrent neural networks—long short-term memory and echo-state networks on sequence prediction problems with both artificial and real-world data. The HTM model achieves comparable accuracy to other state-of-the-art algorithms. The model also exhibits properties that are critical for sequence learning, including continuous online learning, the ability to handle multiple predictions and branching sequences with high-order statistics, robustness to sensor noise and fault tolerance, and good performance without task-specific hyperparameter tuning. Therefore, the HTM sequence memory not only advances our understanding of how the brain may solve the sequence learning problem but is also applicable to real-world sequence learning problems from continuous data streams.","",""

In biological vision systems, scientists have found that specific types of visual neurons have specific preferences to each of the three motion elements. There are computational models on translation and expansion/contraction perceptions; however, little has been done in the past to create computational models for rotational motion perception. To fill this gap, we proposed a neural network that utilizes a specific spatiotemporal arrangement of asymmetric lateral inhibited direction selective neural networks (DSNNs) for rotational motion perception. The proposed neural network consists of two parts—presynaptic and postsynaptic parts. In the presynaptic part, there are a number of lateral inhibited DSNNs to extract directional visual cues. In the postsynaptic part, similar to the arrangement of the directional columns in the cerebral cortex, these direction selective neurons are arranged in a cyclic order to perceive rotational motion cues. In the postsynaptic network, the delayed excitation from each direction selective neuron is multiplied by the gathered excitation from this neuron and its unilateral counterparts depending on which rotation, clockwise (cw) or counter-cw (ccw), to perceive. Systematic experiments under various conditions and settings have been carried out and validated the robustness and reliability of the proposed neural network in detecting cw or ccw rotational motion. This research is a critical step further toward dynamic visual information processing.","",""

We show how these algorithms can be exploited to successfully identify the nonlinearity in the system using neural-network models. By embedding the original problem in one with noise-perturbed state measurements, we present a class of identifiers (under L1 and L2 cost criteria) which secure a good approximant for the system nonlinearity provided that some global optimization technique is used. In this respect, many available learning algorithms in the current neural-network literature, e.g., the backpropagation scheme and the genetic algorithms-based scheme, with slight modifications, can ensure the identification of the system nonlinearity.

Understanding how configuration reflects on the coupled behavior in a system of dynamic nodes can be of great importance, for example, in the context of how the brain connectome is affecting brain function. However, the effect of connectivity patterns on network dynamics is far from being fully understood. We study the connections between edge configuration and dynamics in a simple oriented network composed of two interconnected cliques (representative of brain feedback regulatory circuitry). In this article our main goal is to study the spectra of the graph adjacency and Laplacian matrices, with a focus on three aspects in particular: (1) the sensitivity and robustness of the spectrum in response to varying the intra- and intermodular edge density, (2) the effects on the spectrum of perturbing the edge configuration while keeping the densities fixed, and (3) the effects of increasing the network size. We study some tractable aspects analytically, then simulate more general results numerically, thus aiming to motivate and explain our further work on the effect of these patterns on the network temporal dynamics and phase transitions. We discuss the implications of such results to modeling brain connectomics. We suggest potential applications to understanding synaptic restructuring in learning networks and the effects of network configuration on function of regulatory neural circuits.","",""

By the so‐called command filter method in the controller design procedure, the implementation complexity is reduced in the proposed backstepping method. Moreover, a radial basis function neural network is deployed to reconstruct the unknown nonlinear functions. In addition, the gains of all radial basis function neural networks are updated through one updating law leading to a minimal learning parameter which is independent of the number of neural nodes and the order of the system. Comparing with the existing results, the proposed approach can stabilize a constrained stochastic system more effectively and with less computational burden.

With these interfaces, it is very important to decode a user’s movement intention, to properly control the external devices. However, improving the performance of these interfaces is difficult due to the high variations in the EMG signal patterns caused by intra-user variability. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel subject-transfer framework for decoding hand movements, which is robust in terms of intra-user variability. In the proposed framework, supportive convolutional neural network (CNN) classifiers, which are pre-trained using the EMG data of several subjects, are selected and fine-tuned for the target subject via single-trial analysis. Then, the target subject’s hand movements are classified by voting the outputs of the supportive CNN classifiers. The feasibility of the proposed framework is validated with NinaPro databases 2 and 3, which comprise 49 hand movements of 40 healthy and 11 amputee subjects, respectively. The experimental results indicate that, when compared to the self-decoding framework, which uses only the target subject’s data, the proposed framework can successfully decode hand movements with improved performance in both healthy and amputee subjects.

Some of these principles have been scattered in the literature, but the others are introduced in this paper for the first time. Under the guidance of these six principles, we propose a defense framework to enhance the robustness of deep neural networks against adversarial malware evasion attacks. By conducting experiments with the Drebin Android malware dataset, we show that the framework can achieve a 98.49% accuracy (on average) against grey-box attacks, where the attacker knows some information about the defense and the defender knows some information about the attack, and an 89.14% accuracy (on average) against the more capable white-box attacks, where the attacker knows everything about the defense and the defender knows some information about the attack. The framework wins the AICS'2019 challenge by achieving a 76.02% accuracy, where neither the attacker (i.e., the challenge organizer) knows the framework or defense nor we (the defender) know the attacks.

The trained RNN was robust to trigger the sequence in response to various input signals and interpolated a time-warped input for sequence representation. Interestingly, a learned sequence can repeat periodically when the RNN evolved beyond the duration of a single sequence. The eigenspectrum of the learned recurrent connectivity matrix with growing or damping modes, together with the RNN's nonlinearity, were adequate to generate a limit cycle attractor.

It can even memorize randomly labeled data, which has little knowledge behind the instance-label pairs. When a deep network continually learns over time by accommodating new tasks, it usually quickly overwrites the knowledge learned from previous tasks. Referred to as the neural variability, it is well known in neuroscience that human brain reactions exhibit substantial variability even in response to the same stimulus. This mechanism balances accuracy and plasticity/flexibility in the motor learning of natural nervous systems. Thus, it motivates us to design a similar mechanism, named artificial neural variability (ANV), that helps artificial neural networks learn some advantages from “natural” neural networks. We rigorously prove that ANV plays as an implicit regularizer of the mutual information between the training data and the learned model. This result theoretically guarantees ANV a strictly improved generalizability, robustness to label noise, and robustness to catastrophic forgetting. We then devise a neural variable risk minimization (NVRM) framework and neural variable optimizers to achieve ANV for conventional network architectures in practice. The empirical studies demonstrate that NVRM can effectively relieve overfitting, label noise memorization, and catastrophic forgetting at negligible costs.","",""

This idea is typically framed in terms of top-down influences within a cortical control hierarchy, where prefrontal-basal ganglia loops gate multiple input-output channels, which in turn can activate or sequence motor primitives expressed in (pre-)motor cortices. Here we advance a new hypothesis, based on the notion of programmability and an interpreter-programmer computational scheme, on how the PFC can flexibly bias the selection of sensorimotor patterns depending on internal goal and task contexts. In this approach, multiple elementary behaviors representing motor primitives are expressed by a single multi-purpose neural network, which is seen as a reusable area of ""recycled"" neurons (interpreter). The PFC thus acts as a ""programmer"" that, without modifying the network connectivity, feeds the interpreter networks with specific input parameters encoding the programs (corresponding to network structures) to be interpreted by the (pre-)motor areas. Our architecture is validated in a standard test for executive function: the 1-2-AX task. Our results show that this computational framework provides a robust, scalable and flexible scheme that can be iterated at different hierarchical layers, supporting the realization of multiple goals.
