Unlike the conventional coarse-to-fine approaches which likely lead to bias prediction due to poor initialization, our approach aims to learn a policy by leveraging raw pixels to reason a subset of shape candidates, sequentially making plausible decisions to remove outliers for robust initialization. To achieve this, we formulate face alignment as a Markov decision process by defining an agent, which typically interacts with a trajectory of states, actions, state transitions and rewards. The agent seeks an optimal shape searching policy over the whole shape space by maximizing a discounted sum of the received values. To further improve the alignment performance, we develop an LSTM-based value function to evaluate the shape quality. During the training procedure, we adjust the gradient of our value function in directions of the policy gradient. This prevents our training goal from being trapped into local optima entangled by both the pose deformations and appearance variations especially in unconstrained environments. Experimental results show that our proposed RDN consistently outperforms most state-of-the-art approaches on four widely-evaluated challenging datasets.","",""

I do research in the field of artificial intelligence, with the long-term goal of building machines that reason precisely, systematically, in ways that are interpretable and robust to ambiguity in real-world environments. My research advances towards this goal by attempting to combine the complementary strengths of machine learning and symbolic reasoning. My graduate research has focused on developing machine learning models that represent reasoning via symbolic proofs. They show the promise of new learning paradigms that I envision to be more robust, interpretable, and trustworthy for deployment in real-world high-stake applications. Symbolic reasoning is precise and generalizes systematically to unseen scenarios. But it has been restricted to domains amenable to rigid formalization. In contrast, machine learning has the flexibility to handle noisy and ambiguous domains that are hard to formalize. But predominant machine learning models, such as deep neural networks, are notoriously uninterpretable, data-hungry, and incapable of generalizing outside the training data distribution. Integrating the strengths of both approaches is essential for building flexible reasoning machines with precise and systematic generalization. However, due to the discrete nature of symbolic reasoning, such integration may require a radical departure from the predominant paradigm of gradient-based learning. And my research tries to answer what that alternative form of learning might look like.","",""

One way to resolve this issue is to endow the algorithms with higher-level, human-like reasoning abilities - e.g., an awareness that houses are connected to roads with driveways, that roads connect towns, and that bridges cast shadows - and the mechanism for tracking such objects across larger areas in order to resolve ambiguity.

We build spatial ensembles of land cover models with weak supervision and treat them as a hypothesis space.

Methods: A case-based reasoning approach built upon autoencoder deep learning architecture is applied to classify COVID-19 from other non-COVID-19 as well as normal subjects from chest x-ray images. The system integrates the interpretation and decision-making together by producing a set of profiles that in appearance resemble the training samples and hence explain the outcome of classifications. Three classes are studied, which are COVID-19 (n=250), other non-COVID-19 diseases (NCD) (n=384), including TB and ARDS, and normal (n=327). Results: This COVID-CBR system sustains the average sensitivity and specificity of 93.1±3.58% and 96.1±4.10% respectively for classification of these three classes. In comparison with the current state of the art, including COVID-Net, VGG-16 and other explainable AI systems, the developed COVID-CBR system appears to perform similar or better when classifying multi-class categories. Conclusion: This paper presents a case-based reasoning deep learning system for detection of COVID19 from chest x-ray images. Comparison with several state of the art systems is conducted. Although the improvement tends to be marginal, especially for VGG-16, the novelty of this work manifests its interpretable feature building upon case-based reasoning, leading to revealing this viral insight and hence ascertaining more effective treatment and drugs while maintaining being transparent. Furthermore, different from several other current explainable networks that highlight key regions or the points of an input that activate the network, i.e. heat maps, this work is constructed upon whole training images, i.e. case-based, whereby each training image belongs to one of the case clusters.","",""

These rankings provide explorers with an additional line of reasoning to complement conventional, geophysical and geochemical interpretation workflows. The approach shows potential to aid in identifying important criteria for distinguishing geological map units during early stage exploration. This can assist in directing subsequent expenditure towards the acquisition and further development of datasets which will be the most productive for mapping. In this case study, we use Random Forests to classify the lithology of a project in the Central African Copper-Belt, Zambia. The project area boasts extensive magnetic, radiometric, electromagnetic and multi-element geochemical coverage but only sparse geological observations. Under various training data paradigms, Random Forests produced a series of varying but closely related lithological maps. In this study, training data were restricted to outcrop, simulating the data available at the early stages of the project. Variable ranking highlighted those datasets which were of greatest importance to the result. Both geophysical and geochemical datasets were well represented in the highest ranking variables, reinforcing the importance of access to both data types. Further analysis showed that in many cases, the importance of high ranking datasets had a plausible geological explanation, often consistent with conventional interpretation. In other cases the method provides new insights, identifying datasets which may not have been considered from the outset of a new project.","",""

In most applications, the state of the world changes with time. Sensors are employed to measure part or whole of the world’s state. However, sensors often fail amidst operation; feeding as such decision-making with wrong information about the world. Moreover, hardware degradation may alter dynamic behaviour, and subsequently the capabilities, of an autonomous system; rendering the original mission infeasible. This thesis applies machine learning to yield powerful and robust tools that can facilitate autonomy in modern systems. Incremental kernel regression is used for dynamic modelling. Algorithms of this sort are easy to train and are highly adaptive. Adaptivity allows for model adjustments, whenever the environment of operation changes. Bayesian reasoning provides a rigorous framework for addressing uncertainty. Moreover, using Bayesian Networks, complex inference regarding hardware degradation can be answered. Specifically, adaptive modelling is combined with Bayesian reasoning to yield recursive estimation algorithms that are robust to sensor failures. Two solutions are presented by extending existing recursive estimation algorithms from the robotics literature. The algorithms are deployed on an underwater vehicle and the performance is assessed in real-world experiments. A comparison against standard filters is also provided. Next, the previous algorithms are extended to consider sensor and actuator failures jointly. An algorithm that can detect thruster failures in an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle has been developed. Moreover, the algorithm adapts the dynamic model online to compensate for the detected fault. The performance of this algorithm was also tested in a real-world application. One step further than hardware fault detection, prognostics predict how much longer can a particular hardware component operate normally. Ubiquitous sensors in modern systems render data-driven prognostics a viable solution. However, training is based on skewed datasets; datasets where the samples from the faulty region of operation are much fewer than the ones from the healthy region of operation.

Attaining human-level robust reasoning requires combining sound symbolic reasoning with robust connectionist learning. However, connectionist learning uses low-level representations–such as embeddings–rather than symbolic representations. This challenge constitutes what is referred to as the Neuro-Symbolic gap. A field of study to bridge this gap between the two paradigms has been called neuro-symbolic integration or neuro-symbolic computing. This chapter aims to present approaches that contribute towards bridging the Neuro-Symbolic gap specifically in the Semantic Web field, RDF Schema (RDFS) and EL+ reasoning and to discuss the benefits and shortcomings of neuro-symbolic reasoning.","",""

Machine Learning offers an alternative approach to exploiting LOD’s data with the advantages that Machine Learning algorithms are typically robust to both noise and data inconsistencies and are able to efficiently utilize nondeterministic dependencies in the data. From a Machine Learning point of view, LOD is challenging due to its relational nature and its scale. Here, we present an efficient approach to relational learning on LOD data, based on the factorization of a sparse tensor that scales to data consisting of millions of entities, hundreds of relations and billions of known facts. Furthermore, we show how ontological knowledge can be incorporated in the factorization to improve learning results and how computation can be distributed across multiple nodes. We demonstrate that our approach is able to factorize the YAGO 2 core ontology and globally predict statements for this large knowledge base using a single dual-core desktop computer. Furthermore, we show experimentally that our approach achieves good results in several relational learning tasks that are relevant to Linked Data.

Although deep neural networks (DNN) have shown remarkable successes in many tasks, they are also criticized for the lack of interpretability and transparency. Interpreting a shared DNN model faces two additional challenges compared with interpreting a general model. (1) Limited training data can be disclosed to users. (2) The internal structure of the models may not be available. These two challenges impede the application of most existing interpretability approaches, such as saliency maps or influence functions, for DNN models. Case-based reasoning methods have been used for interpreting decisions; however, how to select and organize the data points under the constraints of shared DNN models is not discussed. Moreover, simply providing cases as explanations may not be sufficient for supporting instance level interpretability. Meanwhile, existing interpretation methods for DNN models generally lack the means to evaluate the reliability of the interpretation. In this article, we propose a framework named Shared Model INTerpreter (SMINT) to address the above limitations. We propose a new data structure called a boundary graph to organize training points to mimic the predictions of DNN models. We integrate local features, such as saliency maps and interpretable input masks, into the data structure to help users to infer the model decision boundaries. We show that the boundary graph is able to address the reliability issues in many local interpretation methods. We further design an algorithm named hidden-layer aware p-test to measure the reliability of the interpretations. Our experiments show that SMINT is able to achieve above 99% fidelity to corresponding DNN models on both MNIST and ImageNet by sharing only a tiny fraction of training data to make these models interpretable. The human pilot study demonstrates that SMINT provides better interpretability compared with existing methods. Moreover, we demonstrate that SMINT is able to assist model tuning for better performance on different user data.","",""

As causal reasoning has an instinct for modeling distribution change, we propose to incorporate causality into mitigating adversarial vulnerability. However, causal formulations of the intuition of adversarial attack and the development of robust DNNs are still lacking in the literature. To bridge this gap, we construct a causal graph to model the generation process of adversarial examples and define the adversarial distribution to formalize the intuition of adversarial attacks. From a causal perspective, we find that the label is spuriously correlated with the style (content-independent) information when an instance is given. The spurious correlation implies that the adversarial distribution is constructed via making the statistical conditional association between style information and labels drastically different from that in natural distribution. Thus, DNNs that fit the spurious correlation are vulnerable to the adversarial distribution. Inspired by the observation, we propose the adversarial distribution alignment method to eliminate the difference between the natural distribution and the adversarial distribution. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method. Our method can be seen as the first attempt to leverage causality for mitigating adversarial vulnerability.","",""

To demonstrate these two approaches and their integration for effective explainable generalized detection, COVID-19 misinformation is considered a case study. We experimented with two datasets, namely CoAID and MiSoVac, and compared results with and without DANN implementation. DANN significantly improves the accuracy measure F1 classification score and increases the accuracy and AUC performance. The results obtained show that the proposed framework performs well in the case of domain shift and can learn domain-invariant features while explaining the target labels with LIME implementation enabling trustworthy information processing and extraction to combat misinformation effectively.","",""

An UAV has shown promising results in dangerous conditions such as forest fires, search and rescue, medical deliveries, wildlife monitoring and geophysical scanning. Some external conditions like slow or no internet connection areas such as rural, farm, forest, ocean, etc. may affect the performance of the UAVs. These conditions can be considered as lost-link problems. Several approaches have been conducted to resolve such issues by implementing robust on-board architecture, machine learning approaches and developing knowledge based reasoning systems. However, much of software architecture research has concentrated on UAV implementation in normal network condition. Thus, we propose a model for considering lost-link problems in software architecture. In this paper, we describe two interconnected architectures for client and server. The UAV as a client is controlled by microkernel based architecture and the server is developed using microservice architecture. Both of them are connected using a synchronizer component to collect, filter, analyze, predict, and mitigate an UAV when a lost-link problem occurs. Therefore, the UAV can still find an appropriate action to complete a mission as far as the sensor and actuator are not in a critical condition.

Several conventional data mining methods have been adapted for direct application to relational data representation. Relational Bayesian Networks (RBNs) extend Bayesian networks (BNs) to a relational data mining context. To use this model, it is first necessary to build it: the structure and parameters of a RBN must be set manually or learned from a relational observational dataset. Learning the structure remains the most complicated issue as it is a NP-hard problem. Existing approaches for RBNs structure learning are inspired from classical methods of learning the structure of BNs. The evaluation of learning approaches requires testing datasets and evaluation measurements. For BNs, datasets are usually sampled from real known networks. Otherwise, processes to randomly generate the model and the data are already established. Both practices are almost absent for RBR. Moreover, metrics to evaluate a RBN structure learning algorithm are not yet proposed.    This thesis provides two major contributions. I) A synthetic approach allowing to generate random RBNs from scratch. The proposed method allows to generate RBNs as well as synthetic relational data from a randomly generated relational schema and a random set of probabilistic dependencies. Also, we discuss the adaptation of the evaluation metrics of BNs structure learning algorithms to the relational context and we propose new relational evaluation measurements.

Yet what exactly this entails in theory and in practice is not immediately apparent. Theoretically, this declarative statement subtly implies a commitment to a consequentialist ethics. Practically, some of the more promising machine learning techniques to create a robust AI, and perhaps even an artificial general intelligence (AGI) also commit one to a form of utilitarianism. In both dimensions, the logic of the beneficial AI movement may not in fact create ""beneficial AI"" in either narrow applications or in the form of AGI if the ethical assumptions are not made explicit and clear. Additionally, as it is likely that reinforcement learning (RL) will be an important technique for machine learning in this area, it is also important to interrogate how RL smuggles in a particular type of consequentialist reasoning into the AI: particularly, a brute form of hedonistic act utilitarianism. Since the mathematical logic commits one to a maximization function, the result is that an AI will inevitably be seeking more and more rewards. We have two conclusions that arise from this. First, is that if one believes that a beneficial AI is an ethical AI, then one is committed to a framework that posits 'benefit' is tantamount to the greatest good for the greatest number. Second, if the AI relies on RL, then the way it reasons about itself, the environment, and other agents, will be through an act utilitarian morality.

Fuzzy-SVM rule bases are built, which require simple evaluation data rather than thousands of input-output training data. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by a series of simulations and implemented with a microcontroller for navigation.

The overall architecture aims to support a meta-learning strategy, for which multiple learning models are trained together and used for the inference. The meta framework is highly advantageous for developing a robust learning model, which is suitable for complicated nature of machine reasoning attempted by memory augmented network models. For the required computational scalability, our framework is designed to drive an ensemble of training models and multiple inference agents dynamically, leveraging parallel and distributed task and memory management. In this work, we focus on developing an optimized implementation of a computing environment for multi-node systems, specifically with the two high-end cluster systems (XSEDE Comet and Bridges) which are equipped with multiple GPUs along with a local runtime environment using an HPC container (Singularity).

Case based reasoning (CBR) is known to provide helpful and generic guidelines for practitioners as well as for the design of medical expert systems dealing with such non-standard diagnostic problems. Single example learning (SEL) algorithms offer more formal machine learning framework for classification of rare and novel classes. However, both CBR and SEL approaches require significant number of wellstudied examples and a set of objective features capable to provide robust matching of novel examples with the previous ones. In practice, data sets for well-defined abnormalities suited for quantification with existing indicators are often limited. However, significant amount of valuable clinical information from cases labeled only as normal or abnormal without particular diagnosis remains underutilized. Recently, we have demonstrated that this information can be effectively employed to produce powerful normal-abnormal meta-classifiers using ensemble learning techniques applied to existing physiological indicators. This is achieved by an optimal weighted combination of complementary indicators which are experts in different regimes of the considered biological complex system. Therefore, partial information of wide variety of dynamical regimes becomes implicitly encoded in the obtained ensemble of classifiers, while only aggregated output is used. Extraction of this underutilized knowledge could be formalized in terms of ensemble decomposition learning (EDL) and used for representation of complex and rare cases in terms of intrinsic dynamical regimes. Such representation could prove to be more accurate and robust compared to traditional CBR and SEL approaches. Illustrative application of the EDL approach to cardiac diagnostics based on HRV analysis is presented and discussed.","",""

When humans perform this task, they are able to do it in a flexible and robust manner, integrating modularly any novel visual capability with diverse options for various elaborations of the task. In contrast, current approaches to solve this problem by a machine are based on casting the problem as an end-to-end learning problem, which lacks such abilities.  We present a different approach, inspired by the aforementioned human capabilities. The approach is based on the compositional structure of the question. The underlying idea is that a question has an abstract representation based on its structure, which is compositional in nature. The question can consequently be answered by a composition of procedures corresponding to its substructures. The basic elements of the representation are logical patterns, which are put together to represent the question. These patterns include a parametric representation for object classes, properties and relations. Each basic pattern is mapped into a basic procedure that includes meaningful visual tasks, and the patterns are composed to produce the overall answering procedure.  The UnCoRd (Understand Compose and Respond) system, based on this approach, integrates existing detection and classification schemes for a set of object classes, properties and relations. These schemes are incorporated in a modular manner, providing elaborated answers and corrections for negative answers.

There is accordingly a growing demand for decision support systems (DSSs) to assist humans in their tasks. To provide accurate and reliable decision support, a DSS needs not only to be robust in the face of the uncertainty but also to model the decision-making logic in a form that is understandable. Compared with other machine learning methods, fuzzy rule-based systems possess the merits of providing strong approximate reasoning in the presence of imprecise data while representing domain knowledge as a set of interpretable semantic rules. Using them to realize DSSs is thus a most suitable approach yielding powerful fuzzy decision support systems (FDSSs). However, the synthesis of an optimal FDSS with well-balanced accuracy and interpretability is an arduous task. Experience shows that it is very difficult for human experts to manually design its two most important components, the fuzzy membership functions and fuzzy rule base, which directly affect system performance. Ad-hoc architectures, which must be redesigned anew for every application, and improperly chosen parameters typically introduce unwanted biases and unavoidably result in suboptimal systems. Ideally, the decision-making logic should therefore be induced automatically from example and further optimized for the problem at hand. To achieve this goal, a generic approach is needed that can automatically synthesize an accurate and interpretable FDSS, while requiring minimal or no human effort.

These estimators achieve optimal rates of convergence under minimal assumptions on the dataset. The dataset may also have been corrupted by outliers on which no assumption is granted. We also analyze these new estimators with standard tools from robust statistics. In particular, we revisit the concept of breakdown point. We modify the original definition by studying the number of outliers that a dataset can contain without deteriorating the estimation properties of a given estimator. This new notion of breakdown number, that takes into account the statistical performances of the estimators, is non-asymptotic in nature and adapted for machine learning purposes. We proved that the breakdown number of our estimator is of the order of (number of observations)*(rate of convergence). For instance, the breakdown number of our estimators for the problem of estimation of a d-dimensional vector with a noise variance sigma^2 is sigma^2d and it becomes sigma^2 s log(d/s) when this vector has only s non-zero component. Beyond this breakdown point, we proved that the rate of convergence achieved by our estimator is (number of outliers) divided by (number of observation).  Besides these theoretical guarantees, the major improvement brought by these new estimators is that they are easily computable in practice. In fact, basically any algorithm used to approximate the standard Empirical Risk Minimizer (or its regularized versions) has a robust version approximating our estimators. As a proof of concept, we study many algorithms for the classical LASSO estimator. A byproduct of the MOM algorithms is a measure of depth of data that can be used to detect outliers.","",""

Despite its current success, there are two major challenges for machine learning algorithms: limited robustness and generalizability. The robustness of a neural network is defined as the influence that input perturbations have on its final prediction. It has been shown that neural networks are very sensitive to input perturbations. For convolutional neural networks, its prediction can be totally different for input images that are visually indistinguishable to human eyes. Based on such property, hackers can reversely engineer the input to trick machine learning systems in targeted ways. These adversarial attacks have shown to be surprisingly effective, which has raised serious concerns over safety-critical applications like autonomous driving. In the meantime, how to improve the robustness of neural networks is still an open question. The generalizability of a neural network refers to its ability to be effective across a range of different inputs. On one hand, machine learning algorithms require a large number of samples from the data distribution in order to generalize well. It brings a big need for labeled data to perform supervised learning, and over-fitting on training data needs to be avoided for better generalization. On the other hand, machine learning models often fail to carry out reliable generalizations whenever there is a scarcity of supervised data. Many techniques have been proposed to improve the model generalizability; however, generalization with a few samples is still a challenging task. In this dissertation, we are thus motivated to improve the robustness and generalizability of neural networks. Firstly, unlike traditional bottom-up classifiers, we use a pre-trained generative model to perform top-down reasoning and infer the label information. The proposed generative classifier has shown to be promising in handling challenging classification tasks like adversarial attacks and input distribution shifts. Secondly, we focus on improving the network robustness and propose an extension to adversarial training by considering the transformation invariance. Proposed method improves the robustness over state-of-the-art methods by 2.5\% on MNIST, 3.7\% on CIFAR-10, and 1.1\% on restricted ImageNet. Thirdly, we focus on designing networks that generalize well at predicting physics response. Our physics prior knowledge is used to guide the designing of the network architecture, which enables efficient learning and inference.

The problems caused by this task-based nature necessitated flexibility and robustness for certain broader subfields of AI, such as L5 self-driving, domestic robotics, or personal assistants; there is even increasing interest in generality itself (e.g., developmental robotics, artificial general intelligence) (2, 3). The first and most important step to take in order to offer an approach that is closer to human intelligence is to examine the concept of intelligence and to define it in the most useful way. Various definitions have been made for intelligence in the past. Legg and Hutter summarized the definitions made in the context of artificial intelligence research as follows: ""Intelligence measures a person's ability to achieve goals in a wide and varied environment (4)."" Two main characteristics are emphasized here: a task-goal focus and generalizability to a wide range of environments. Accordingly, while human intelligence can perform tasks with its high ability, these abilities can also be generalized for new tasks in new environments (skill acquisition). This feature is a mechanism that human nature has developed in line with evolutionary psychology to solve new unknown tasks and problems (5, 6). In the direction of the development of AI, many approaches have emerged to develop and evaluate AI models. One of them is the human observational approach that examines, judges, and scores the system’s inputs and outputs. This is a highly subjective, difficult, and expensive method to automate. White-box analysis, on the other hand, is inspecting the implementation of the system to determine its input-output response and score it (e.g., an algorithm that plays “Connect Four”) (7). Peer confrontation, for example, is having the system compete against either other AIs or humans. This is the preferred mode of evaluation for player-versus-player games, such as chess. The benchmarking approach, which is based on enabling the system through algorithms to produce outputs for a ""test set"" of inputs (or environments) for which the desired outcome is known (solvable by humans), is another of the most valuable approaches for the evaluation of artificial intelligence. In particular, it is reproducible (test set fixed), scalable (cheap to run the evaluation multiple times), easy to set up, and flexible enough to be applied to a wide variety of possible tasks (8).

However, there is a lack of quantitative evidence regarding the lifespan, architecture, frequency, and complexity of these pipelines to understand how data management research can be used to make them more efficient, effective, robust, and reproducible. To that end, we analyze the provenance graphs of 3000 production ML pipelines at Google, comprising over 450,000 models trained, spanning a period of over four months, in an effort to understand the complexity and challenges underlying production ML. Our analysis reveals the characteristics, components, and topologies of typical industry-strength ML pipelines at various granularities. Along the way, we introduce a specialized data model for representing and reasoning about repeatedly run components in these ML pipelines, which we call model graphlets. We identify several rich opportunities for optimization, leveraging traditional data management ideas.

The TCAV algorithm achieves a degree of global interpretability for DNNs through human-defined concepts as explanations. This project introduces Robust TCAV, which builds on TCAV and experimentally determines best practices for this method. The objectives for Robust TCAV are 1) Making TCAV more consistent by reducing variance in the TCAV score distribution and 2) Increasing CAV and TCAV score resistance to perturbations. A difference of means method for CAV generation was determined to be the best practice to achieve both objectives. Many areas of the TCAV process are explored including CAV visualization in low dimensions, negative class selection, and activation perturbation in the direction of a CAV. Finally, a thresholding technique is considered to remove noise in TCAV scores. This project is a step in the direction of making TCAV, an already impactful algorithm in interpretability, more reliable and useful for practitioners.","",""

HMD methods apply Machine Learning (ML) classifiers on microarchitectural events monitored by built-in Hardware Performance Counter (HPC) registers available in modern microprocessors to recognize the patterns of anomalies (e.g., signatures of malicious applications). Existing hardware malware detection solutions have mainly focused on utilizing standard ML algorithms to detect the existence of malware without considering an adaptive and cost-efficient approach for online malware detection. Our comprehensive analysis across a wide range of malicious software applications and different branches of machine learning algorithms indicates that the type of adopted ML algorithm to detect malicious applications at the hardware level highly correlates with the type of the examined malware, and the ultimate performance evaluation metric (F-measure, robustness, latency, detection rate/cost, etc.) to select the most efficient ML model for distinguishing the target malware from benign program.

Adaptive-HMD is equipped with a lightweight tree-based decision-making algorithm that accurately selects the most efficient ML model to be used for the inference in online malware detection according to the users' preference and optimal performance vs. cost (hardware overhead and latency) criteria.

Traditional machine learning models are no longer robust and reliable when they are under attack. The action and reaction between machine learning systems and the adversary can be modeled as a game between two or more players. Under well‐defined attack models, game theory can provide robustness guarantee for machine learning models that are otherwise vulnerable to application‐time data corruption. We review two cases of game theory‐based machine learning techniques: in one case, players play a zero sum game by following a minimax strategy, while in the other case, players play a sequential game with one player as the leader and the rest as the followers. Experimental results on e‐mail spam and web spam datasets are presented. In the zero sum game, we demonstrate that an adversarial SVM model built upon the minimax strategy is much more resilient to adversarial attacks than standard SVM and one‐class SVM models. We also show that optimal learning strategies derived to counter overly pessimistic attack models can produce unsatisfactory results when the real attacks are much weaker. In the sequential game, we demonstrate that the mixed strategy, allowing a player to randomize over available strategies, is the best solution in general without knowing what types of adversaries machine learning applications are facing in the wild.

All of them had 21 biomarkers (antigen concentration) as features. The positive effect means that the patient responded to therapy. The features data has quantitative (continuous) values, but we made it categorical by determining the 6 intervals, so each of the biomarkers was replaced with 6 encoding (‘dummy’) variables with possible values 1 or 0, depending on if the patient’s biomarker value belongs to this interval. Methods: The machine learning algorithm for response prediction is called JSM method for automatic support of scientific research (JSM method ASSR). It allows conducting a plausible reasoning that is realized in hypotheses generating and keeping only those that remain after each database enlargement. The reasoning is based on the similarity of the objects, that can be obtained with patients’ (objects’) features intersection using the statements from the set theory. According to it, the object is representing by a set of features, and hypotheses about its belongings to a class are also sets of features, that are specific for the current class. So, for each class there is a separate amount of hypotheses is generating. On the prediction stage each object given for the prediction is being checked for how many hypotheses are entering into it, or, in other words – is a subset of this object. Based on this information prediction is making: it depends on which hypotheses (of which class) are prevailing in entering in the object. This kind of machine learning approach also allows us to get the reasons why the particular object is classified into his class. So it can be used not only for the classification problem but also for the knowledge discovery about effects’ reasons. We divided the database into 2 batches: source base (18 objects) and first enlargement (17 objects) for the learning, and the rest 4 objects were left for testing. The source base and its enlargement are being permutated during the learning process for more reliability and robustness. We applied a cross-validation, according to which each object was at least 1 time in the test group. So it was 10 learning launches with predictions: 9 with 4 test examples and the rest 1 - with 3 test examples. Results: On all 10 cross-validation launches, there were 26 correct predictions. Also were 5 cases with a failure, 5 false-positive predictions, and 3 false-negative ones. Recall of the model was 85%, and precision is 77%, F1 score = 0.81. We also obtained reasons, which were common for all the database permutation. It meant that patients who will not respond to therapy should have CD8 value at interval 39.9-54.1 and IRI at interval 0.29-0.7. Discussion: Actually 39 samples are a small amount of data even for the JSM method ASSR, but we showed the suitability of described approach for the quantity data predicting and the reasons extracting. With the enlargement of the source database, it will be possible to get higher results. Citation Format: Dmitrii K. Chebanov, Irina N. Mikhaylova, Nadezhda S. Tatevosova.

Unlike classical RTM parametrization schemes based on ANN, in this method the resulting ANN can be used for arbitrary geometry and layer optical thicknesses. In the second method, the IO is trained by using the real measurements (preprocessed Level-2 TROPOMI data) to improve the stability of the inverse operator.

Adequately concatenating these modules and fine tuning the resulting system can be viewed as an algebraic operation in a space of models.

This observation suggests a conceptual continuity between algebraically rich inference systems, such as logical or probabilistic inference, and simple manipulations, such as the mere concatenation of trainable learning systems.

In this paper, we take inspiration from specifications used in formal methods, expressing functional-correctness properties by reasoning about k different executions—socalled k-safety properties. Considering a credit-screening model of a bank, the expected property that ""if a person is denied a loan and their income decreases, they should still be denied the loan"" is a 2-safety property. Here, we show the wide applicability of k-safety properties for machine-learning models and present the first specification language for expressing them. We also operationalize the language in a framework for automatically validating such properties using metamorphic testing. Our experiments show that our framework is effective in identifying property violations, and that detected bugs could be used to train better models.","",""

Given that the ML mechanism forces the model uncertainties to remain within the ILC robust tolerance, an ILC update law is proposed to deal with non-repetitive TVSs.

The recent attention to causal fairness, however, has been accompanied with great skepticism due to practical and epistemological challenges with applying current causal fairness approaches in the literature. Motivated by the long-standing empirical work on causality in econometrics, social sciences, and biomedical sciences, in this paper we lay out the conditions for appropriate application of causal fairness under the""potential outcomes framework.""We highlight key aspects of causal inference that are often ignored in the causal fairness literature. In particular, we discuss the importance of specifying the nature and timing of interventions on social categories such as race or gender. Precisely, instead of postulating an intervention on immutable attributes, we propose a shift in focus to their perceptions and discuss the implications for fairness evaluation. We argue that such conceptualization of the intervention is key in evaluating the validity of causal assumptions and conducting sound causal analysis including avoiding post-treatment bias. Subsequently, we illustrate how causality can address the limitations of existing fairness metrics, including those that depend upon statistical correlations. Specifically, we introduce causal variants of common statistical notions of fairness, and we make a novel observation that under the causal framework there is no fundamental disagreement between different notions of fairness. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments where we demonstrate our approach for evaluating and mitigating unfairness, specially when post-treatment variables are present.","",""

When there are several criteria involved, it makes the supplier assessment process more complicated. For a comprehensive and robust assessment process, we propose the use of supervised machine learning algorithms to classify various suppliers into four categories: excellent, good, satisfactory, and unsatisfactory. In this paper, supervised learning (classification) algorithms are applied for a supplier assessment problem where a model is trained based on the previous historical data and then tested on the new unseen data set. This method will provide an efficient way for supplier assessment that is more effective in terms of accuracy and time when compared to MCDM approach. Classification algorithms such as support vector machines (with linear, polynomial and radial basis kernels), logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, and naïve Bayes methods are used to train the model and their performance is assessed against a test data.

Complex event processing (CEP) and machine learning (ML) have been developed actively in the last years in IIoT to identify patterns in heterogeneous data streams and fuse raw data into tangible facts. In a traditional compute-centric paradigm, the raw field data are continuously sent to the cloud and processed centrally. As IIoT devices become increasingly pervasive, concerns are raised since transmitting such an amount of data is energy-intensive, vulnerable to be intercepted, and subjected to high latency. Decentralized on-device ML and CEP provide a solution where data is processed primarily on edge devices. Thus communications can be minimized. However, this is no mean feat because most IIoT edge devices are resource-constrained with low power consumption. This paper proposes a framework that exploits ML and CEP's synergy at the edge in distributed sensor networks. By leveraging tiny ML and μCEP, we now shift the computation from the cloud to the resource-constrained IIoT devices and allow users to adapt on-device ML models and CEP reasoning rules flexibly on the fly.

However, the spatial distribution of feature is not considered in standard SSVM-based trackers, therefore leading to limited performance. To obtain a robust discriminative classifier, this paper proposes a novel tracking framework that spatially regularizes SSVM, which yields a new spatially regularized SSVM (SRSSVM). We utilize the spatial regularization prior to penalize the learning classifier with the same size as the target region. The location of classifier spatially located far from the center of region is assigned large weight and vice versa. Then, it is introduced into the SSVM model as a regularization factor to learn the robust discriminative model. Furthermore, an optimizing algorithm with dual coordination descent is presented to efficiently solve the SRSSVM tracking model. Our proposed SRSSVM tracking method has low computational cost like the traditional linear SSVM tracker while can significantly improve the robustness of the discriminative classifier.

For some cases, the models achieved statistical equivalence, but relying on a highly reduced set of features. Indeed, by using explicit feature selection, simpler models such as Naive Bayes became statistically equivalent to robust models such as Random Forest.

However, deep learning is often criticized for its lack of robustness in adversarial settings (e.g., vulnerability to adversarial inputs) and general inability to rationalize its predictions. In this work, we exploit the structure of deep learning to enable new learning-based inference and decision strategies that achieve desirable properties such as robustness and interpretability. We take a first step in this direction and introduce the Deep k-Nearest Neighbors (DkNN). This hybrid classifier combines the k-nearest neighbors algorithm with representations of the data learned by each layer of the DNN: a test input is compared to its neighboring training points according to the distance that separates them in the representations. We show the labels of these neighboring points afford confidence estimates for inputs outside the model's training manifold, including on malicious inputs like adversarial examples--and therein provides protections against inputs that are outside the models understanding. This is because the nearest neighbors can be used to estimate the nonconformity of, i.e., the lack of support for, a prediction in the training data. The neighbors also constitute human-interpretable explanations of predictions. We evaluate the DkNN algorithm on several datasets, and show the confidence estimates accurately identify inputs outside the model, and that the explanations provided by nearest neighbors are intuitive and useful in understanding model failures.","",""

NN and CBR can be directly applied to the classification and regression problem without additional transform mechanisms. However, they all have disadvantages. The knowledge representation of NN is unreadable and this black box property restricts the application of NN to areas which needs proper explanations. Meanwhile CBR suffers from the feature-weighting problem, when CBR measures the distance between cases, some input features should be treated more importantly than others. This paper, we propose a hybrid prediction system of extreme learning machine (ELM) and Case-based reasoning (ELM-CBR). In our hybrid system, the feature weight set calculated from the trained ELM network plays the core role in connecting both the learning strategies, and the explanation on prediction can be given by presenting the most similar cases from the case base. Moreover, the prediction value of the Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine also utilized in conjunction with the neighborhood information. This provides extended information for the query with most similar cases in the database. Finally, we present an application in the sugarcane juice clarification, experiments show that the hybrid system has a better recognition rate compared the k-NN and GA-CBR method.","",""

Given an image, we first predict a probabilistic graph that represents its underlying semantics and serves as a structured world model. Then, we perform sequential reasoning over the graph, iteratively traversing its nodes to answer a given question or draw a new inference. In contrast to most neural architectures that are designed to closely interact with the raw sensory data, our model operates instead in an abstract latent space, by transforming both the visual and linguistic modalities into semantic concept-based representations, thereby achieving enhanced transparency and modularity. We evaluate our model on VQA-CP and GQA, two recent VQA datasets that involve compositionality, multi-step inference and diverse reasoning skills, achieving state-of-the-art results in both cases. We provide further experiments that illustrate the model's strong generalization capacity across multiple dimensions, including novel compositions of concepts, changes in the answer distribution, and unseen linguistic structures, demonstrating the qualities and efficacy of our approach.","",""

High-accuracy real-time forecasting of traffic flow is extremely difficult due to the effect of noise or outliers from complex traffic conditions. In this study, a novel probabilistic learning system, probabilistic regularized extreme learning machine combined with ANFIS (probabilistic R-ELANFIS), is proposed to capture the correlations among traffic flow data and, thereby, improve the accuracy of traffic flow forecasting. The new learning system adopts a fantastic objective function that minimizes both the mean and the variance of the model bias. The results from an experiment based on real-world traffic flow data showed that, compared with some kernel-based approaches, neural network approaches, and conventional ANFIS learning systems, the proposed probabilistic R-ELANFIS achieves competitive performance in terms of forecasting ability and generalizability.","",""

Most FS methods rank the features in order of their scores based on a specific criterion and then select the <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$k$ </tex-math></inline-formula> top-ranked features, where <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$k$ </tex-math></inline-formula> is the number of desired features. However, these features are usually not the top-<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$k$ </tex-math></inline-formula> features and may present a suboptimal choice. To address this issue, we propose a novel FS framework in this article to select the exact top-<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$k$ </tex-math></inline-formula> features in the unsupervised, semisupervised, and supervised scenarios. The new framework utilizes the <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\ell _{0,2}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-norm as the matrix sparsity constraint rather than its relaxations, such as the <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\ell _{1,2}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-norm. Since the <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\ell _{0,2}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-norm constrained problem is difficult to solve, we transform the discrete <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\ell _{0,2}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-norm-based constraint into an equivalent 0–1 integer constraint and replace the 0–1 integer constraint with two continuous constraints.

Unsupervised and semisupervised FS methods are developed based on the proposed framework, and extensive experiments on real-world data sets are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed FS framework.","",""
