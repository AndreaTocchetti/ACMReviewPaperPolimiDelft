A gully inventory map of 208 gullies was prepared through field survey and Google earth imageries. Following the 70/30 ratio, three randomly sampled groups of altered training and validation gully sets G1, G2 and G3 were prepared for modelling gully erosion susceptibility. Using information gain ratio and multi-collinearity analysis, 14 gully conditioning factors (GCF) were selected. The discrimination ability and reliability of the models were measured through Kappa coefficient, efficiency, receiver operating characteristic curve, root-mean-square-error (RMSE) and mean-absolute-error (MAE). The stability of the machine learning models was estimated by comparing the accuracy statistics and the departure in areal outcomes among intra-model and inter-model. RF model was found as the most consistent. With the highest mean AUC (0.903), efficiency (91.17), Kappa coefficient (0.835) and lowest RMSE (0.192) and MAE (0.081), RF was found to be more consistent when the training and validation data sets were altered. The effectiveness of each input GCFs was determined using map removal sensitivity analysis technique. This study could be supportive in ascertaining model deployment for mapping gully erosion and managing the land resource.","",""

In this critical review, we used hypothetical reverse mutations to evaluate the performance of five representative algorithms and found all of them suffer from the problem of overfitting. This approach is based on the fact that if a wild-type protein is more stable than a mutant protein, then the same mutant is less stable than the wild-type protein. We analyzed the underlying issues and suggest that the main causes of the overfitting problem include that the numbers of training cases were too small, and the features used in the models were not sufficiently informative for the task. We make recommendations on how to avoid overfitting in this important research area and improve the reliability and robustness of ML-based algorithms in general.","",""

A conventional assumption in the existing research is that empirical training data do not contain any noise but this may not be satisfied in some practical circumstances. Consequently the existing convergence results do not provide a guarantee as to whether empirical risks based on empirical data are reliable or not when the data contain some noise. In this paper, we fill out the gap in a few steps. First, we derive moderate sufficient conditions under which the expected risk changes stably (continuously) against small perturbation of the probability distribution of the underlying random variables and demonstrate how the cost function and kernel affect the stability. Second, we examine the difference between laws of the statistical estimators of the expected optimal loss based on pure data and contaminated data using Prokhorov metric and Kantorovich metric and derive some qualitative and quantitative statistical robustness results. Third, we identify appropriate metrics under which the statistical estimators are uniformly asymptotically consistent. These results provide theoretical grounding for analysing asymptotic convergence and examining reliability of the statistical estimators in a number of well-known machine learning models.","",""

An important aspect of this is evaluating how robust a model is to changes in setting or population, which typically requires applying the model to multiple, independent datasets. Since the cost of collecting such datasets is often prohibitive, in this paper, we propose a framework for analyzing this type of stability using the available data. We use the original evaluation data to determine distributions under which the algorithm performs poorly, and estimate the algorithm’s performance on the “worst-case” distribution. We consider shifts in user defined conditional distributions, allowing some distributions to shift while keeping other portions of the data distribution fixed. For example, in a healthcare context, this allows us to consider shifts in clinical practice while keeping the patient population fixed. To address the challenges associated with estimation in complex, high-dimensional distributions, we derive a “debiased” estimator which maintains p N -consistency even when machine learning methods with slower convergence rates are used to estimate the nuisance parameters. In experiments on a real medical risk prediction task, we show this estimator can be used to analyze stability and accounts for realistic shifts that could not previously be expressed. The proposed framework allows practitioners to proactively evaluate the safety of their models without requiring additional data collection.

The adaptive recursive integral terminal sliding mode (ARITSM) control is adopted in the upper controller for guaranteeing the convergence performance of both the actual sideslip angle and the yaw rate with strong robustness and fast convergence rate. Then, a fast nonsingular terminal sliding mode (FNTSM) control with extreme learning machine (ELM) estimator to estimate its equivalent control is designed in the lower controller to track the desired front wheel steering angle calculated from the upper controller for driving the sideslip angle and the yaw rate to converge ideal value. It is shown that the upper controller takes two controlled variables (vehicle sideslip angle and yaw rate) and only one control input (front steering angle) into consideration, which can obtain a better performance compared with the case of using only one of these values. Since using the ELM technique in the lower controller to estimate the equivalent control of the FNTSM, not only the dependence of SbW system dynamics can be alleviated in the process of designing controller but also the excellent steering control performance can be achieved. Comparative simulations are carried out by utilizing Carsim and Matlab software to validate the excellent performance of the proposed control strategy for different steering maneuvers.","",""

First, a multi-objective, multi-modal particle swarm optimization (MOMM-PSO) algorithm was employed to suggest the appropriate initial conditions for a given biped walker model to be stable. The MOMM-PSO with ring topology and special crowding distance (SCD) used in this study can find multiple local minima under multiple objective functions by limiting each agent’s search area properly without determining a large number of parameters. Second, the robustness of stability under external disturbances was studied, considering an impact in the angular displacement sampled from the probabilistic distribution. The proposed systematic approach based on MOMM-PSO can find multiple initial conditions that lead the biped walker in the periodic gait, which could not be found by heuristic approaches in previous literature. In addition, the results from the proposed study showed that the robustness of stability might change depending on the location on a limit cycle where immediate angular displacement perturbation occurs. The observations of this study imply that the symmetry of the stable region about the limit cycle will break depending on the accelerating direction of inertia. We believe that the systematic approach developed in this study significantly increased the efficiency of finding the appropriate initial conditions of a given biped walker and the understanding of robustness of stability under the unexpected external disturbance. Furthermore, a novel methodology proposed for biped walkers in the present study may expand our understanding of human locomotion, which in turn may suggest clinical strategies for gait rehabilitation and help develop gait rehabilitation robotics.","",""

There is a significant need in continual/lifelong learning applications for parameter update algorithms which can be proven stable in the presence of adversarial time-varying regressors. In such settings, the learning algorithm must continually adapt to changes in the regressors. In this paper, we propose a new discrete time algorithm which: 1) provides stability and asymptotic convergence guarantees in the presence of adversarial regressors by leveraging insights from adaptive control theory and 2) provides non-asymptotic accelerated learning guarantees leveraging insights from convex optimization. In particular, our algorithm reaches an $\epsilon$ sub-optimal point in at most $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\sqrt{\epsilon})$ iterations when regressors are constant - matching lower bounds due to Nesterov of $\Omega(1/\sqrt{\epsilon})$, up to a $\log(1/\epsilon)$ factor and provides guaranteed bounds for stability when regressors are time-varying.

The presented control algorithm was based on the machine learning and sliding mode control (SMC) methods. The control compensator used neural networks to estimate the actuator’s dead zone and eliminate its effects. The robust SMC compensator acted as an auxiliary controller to guarantee the system’s stability and robustness under circumstances with model uncertainties, approximation errors, and friction forces. The stability of the closed-loop system and the asymptotic convergence of tracking errors were evaluated using Lyapunov theory. The simulation results showed that the dead zone’s non-linearity can be estimated correctly, and satisfactory trajectory tracking performance can be obtained in this way, since the influences of the actuator’s dead zone were eliminated. The convergence time of the system was reduced from 1.1 to 0.8 s, and the maximum steady-state error was reduced from 0.06 to 0.015 rad.

These methods primarily rely on the gradient of the loss function to estimate descent direction. However, they have a number of drawbacks, including converging to saddle points (as opposed to minima), slow convergence, and sensitivity to parameter tuning. In contrast, second order methods that use curvature information in addition to the gradient, have been shown to achieve faster convergence rates, theoretically. When used in the context of machine learning applications, they offer faster (quadratic) convergence, stability to parameter tuning, and robustness to problem conditioning. In spite of these advantages, first order methods are commonly used because of their simplicity of implementation and low per-iteration cost. The need to generate and use curvature information in the form of a dense Hessian matrix makes each iteration of second order methods more expensive.   In this work, we address three key problems associated with second order methods – (i) what is the best way to incorporate curvature information into the optimization procedure; (ii) how do we reduce the operation count of each iteration in a second order method, while maintaining its superior convergence property; and (iii) how do we leverage high-performance computing platforms to significant accelerate second order methods. To answer the first question, we propose and validate the use of Fisher information matrices in second order methods to significantly accelerate convergence. The second question is answered through the use of statistical sampling techniques that suitably sample matrices to reduce per-iteration cost without impacting convergence. The third question is addressed through the use of graphics processing units (GPUs) in distributed platforms to deliver state of the art solvers.

The ability of Machine-Learning (ML) based model components to generalize to the previously unseen inputs, and the resulting stability of the models that use these components, has been receiving a lot of recent attention, especially when it comes to ML-based parameterizations. At the same time, ML-based emulators of existing parameterizations can be stable, accurate, and fast when used in the model they were specifically designed for. In this work we show that shallow-neural-network-based emulators of radiative transfer parameterizations developed almost a decade ago for a state-of-the-art GCM are robust with respect to the substantial structural and parametric change in the host model: when used in two seven month-long experiments with the new model, they not only remain stable, but generate realistic output. Aspects of neural network architecture and training set design potentially contributing to stability of ML-based model components are discussed. ","",""

We then introduce a formally sound data-independent stability analysis for decision trees and decision tree ensembles, which we experimentally assess on public datasets and we leverage for resilience verification.

Neural networks lack adversarial robustness -- they are vulnerable to adversarial examples that through small perturbations to inputs cause incorrect predictions. Further, trust is undermined when models give miscalibrated or unstable uncertainty estimates, i.e. the predicted probability is not a good indicator of how much we should trust our model and could vary greatly over multiple independent runs. In this paper, we study the connection between adversarial robustness, predictive uncertainty (calibration) and model uncertainty (stability) on multiple classification networks and datasets. We find that the inputs for which the model is sensitive to small perturbations (are easily attacked) are more likely to have poorly calibrated and unstable predictions. Based on this insight, we examine if calibration and stability can be improved by addressing those adversarially unrobust inputs. To this end, we propose Adversarial Robustness based Adaptive Label Smoothing (AR-AdaLS) that integrates the correlations of adversarial robustness and uncertainty into training by adaptively softening labels conditioned on how easily it can be attacked by adversarial examples. We find that our method, taking the adversarial robustness of the in-distribution data into consideration, leads to better calibration and stability over the model even under distributional shifts. In addition, AR-AdaLS can also be applied to an ensemble model to achieve the best calibration performance.","",""

However, most of the existing literature lacks a proper selection of learning models and feature engineering. A hybrid learning model is developed based on the joint operation of various machine learning techniques empowered by ensemble learning mechanisms in the proposed work. Suitable data preparation and feature engineering are performed, and five important meteorological time-series features were selected to train the proposed hybrid model. The study outcome and performance assessment confirms the potential of the proposed solar energy forecasting model. The proposed hybrid model has been shown to predict solar radiation with an accuracy of 93%, which exhibits the robustness and stability of the proposed hybrid prediction system.","",""

However, existing methods mostly construct ambiguity sets by treating all variables equally regardless of the stability of their correlations with the target, resulting in the overwhelmingly-large uncertainty set and low confidence of the learner. In this paper, we propose a novel Stable Adversarial Learning (SAL) algorithm that leverages heterogeneous data sources to construct a more practical uncertainty set and conduct differentiated robustness optimization, where covariates are differentiated according to the stability of their correlations with the target. We theoretically show that our method is tractable for stochastic gradient-based optimization and provide the performance guarantees for our method.

Rather than purely fitting the observed training data, stable learning tries to learn a model with uniformly good performance under non-stationary and agnostic testing data. The key challenge of stable learning in practice is that we do not have any knowledge about the true model and test data distribution as a priori. Under such condition, we cannot expect a faithful estimation of model parameters and its stability over wild changing environments. Previous methods resort to a reweighting scheme to remove the correlations between all the variables through a set of new sample weights. However, we argue that such aggressive decorrelation between all the variables may cause the over-reduced sample size, which leads to the variance inflation and possible underperformance. In this paper, we incorporate the unlabled data from multiple environments into the variable decorrelation framework and propose a Differentiated Variable Decorrelation (DVD) algorithm based on the clustering of variables. Specifically, the variables are clustered according to the stability of their correlations and the variable decorrelation module learns a set of sample weights to remove the correlations merely between the variables of different clusters. Empirical studies on both synthetic and real world datasets clearly demonstrate the efficacy of our DVD algorithm on improving the model parameter estimation and the prediction stability over changing distributions.","",""

In general, learning-based predictive control (LPC) is promising to build data-driven models and solve the online optimization problem with lower computational costs. However, the robustness of LPC is difficult to be guaranteed since there will be uncertainties due to function approximation used in machine learning algorithms. In this paper, a novel robust learning-based predictive control (r-LPC) scheme is proposed for constrained nonlinear systems with unknown dynamics. In r-LPC, the Koopman operator is used to form a global linear representation of the unknown dynamics, and an incremental actor-critic algorithm is presented for receding horizon optimization. To realize the satisfaction of system constraints, soft logarithmic barrier functions are designed within the learning predictive framework. The recursive feasibility and stability of the closed-loop system are discussed under the convergence arguments of the approximation algorithms adopted. Also, the robustness property of r-LPC is analyzed theoretically by taking into consideration the existence of perturbations on the controller due to possible approximation errors. Simulation results with the proposed learning control approach for the data-driven regulation of a Van der Pol oscillator system have been reported, including the comparisons with a classic MPC and an infinite-horizon Dual Heuristic Programming (DHP) algorithm. The results show that the r-LPC significantly outperforms the DHP algorithm in terms of control performance and can be comparative to the MPC in terms of regulating control as well as energy consumption. Moreover, its average computational cost is much smaller than that with the MPC in the adopted environment.","",""

First, we present a generalization of the classical theory of integral quadratic constraints.

Second, we present non-asymptotic lower and upper bounds for core problems in the field of system identification.

The specific contribution of this paper is to advance the formulation robustness and algorithmic scalability of the Operator Inference approach. Regularisation is introduced to the formulation to avoid over-fitting. The task of determining an optimal regularisation is posed as an optimisation problem that balances training error and stability of long-time integration dynamics. A scalable algorithm and open-source implementation are presented, then demonstrated for a single-injector rocket combustion example. This example exhibits rich dynamics that are difficult to capture with state-of-the-art reduced models. With appropriate regularisation and an informed selection of learning variables, the reduced-order models exhibit high accuracy in re-predicting the training regime and acceptable accuracy in predicting future dynamics, while achieving close to a million times speedup in computational cost. When compared to a state-of-the-art model reduction method, the Operator Inference models provide the same or better accuracy at approximately one thousandth of the computational cost.","",""

These rely on the identification of a basis that reduces the dimensionality of the problem and the subsequent use of time series and sequential learning methods to forecast the evolution of the reduced state. Often, however, machine-learned predictions after reduced-basis projection are plagued by issues of stability stemming from incomplete capture of multiscale processes as well as due to error growth for long forecast durations.

Selecting software metrics that are important for software quality classification is a necessary and critical step before the model training process. Recently, the robustness (e.g., stability) of feature selection techniques has been studied, to examine the sensitivity of these techniques to changes (adding/removing program modules to/from their dataset). This work provides an empirical study regarding the stability of feature selection techniques across six software metrics datasets with varying levels of class balance.

Moreover, three factors, feature subset size, degree of perturbation, and class balance of datasets, are considered in this study to evaluate stability of feature selection techniques. Experimental results show that these factors affect the stability of feature selection techniques as one might expect. We found that with few exceptions, feature ranking based on highly imbalanced datasets are less stable than based on slightly imbalanced data. Results also show that making smaller changes to the datasets has less impact on the stability of feature ranking techniques.

An important novelty of LBMPC lies in the fact that its robustness and stability properties are independent of the type of online learning used. This allows the use of advanced statistical or machine learning methods to provide the adaptation for the controller. This paper is concerned with providing practical comparisons of different optimization algorithms for implementing the LBMPC method, for the special case where the dynamic model of the system is linear and the online learning provides linear updates to the dynamic model. For comparison purposes, we have implemented a primal-dual infeasible start interior point method that exploits the sparsity structure of LBMPC. Our open source implementation (called LBmpcIPM) is available through a BSD license and is provided freely to enable the rapid implementation of LBMPC on other platforms. This solver is compared to the dense active set solvers LSSOL and qpOASES using a quadrotor helicopter platform. Two scenarios are considered: The first is a simulation comparing hovering control for the quadrotor, and the second is on-board control experiments of dynamic quadrotor flight. Though the LBmpcIPM method has better asymptotic computational complexity than LSSOL and qpOASES, we find that for certain integrated systems (like our quadrotor testbed) these methods can outperform LBmpcIPM.

PID controllers perform well on linear and near-linear systems but their simplicity is at odds with the robustness required to reliably control complex processes. Modern machine learning techniques offer a way to extend PID controllers beyond their linear control capabilities by using neural networks. However, such an extension comes at the cost of losing stability guarantees and controller interpretability. In this paper, we examine the utility of extending PID controllers with recurrent neural networks—–namely, General Dynamic Neural Networks (GDNN); we show that GDNN (neural) PID controllers perform well on a range of complex control systems and highlight how they can be a scalable and interpretable option for modern control systems. To do so, we provide an extensive study using four benchmark systems that represent the most common control engineering benchmarks. All control environments are evaluated with and without noise as well as with and without disturbances. The neural PID controller performs better than standard PID control in 15 of 16 tasks and better than model-based control in 13 of 16 tasks. As a second contribution, we address the lack of interpretability that prevents neural networks from being used in real-world control processes. We use bounded-input bounded-output stability analysis to evaluate the parameters suggested by the neural network, making them understandable for engineers. This combination of rigorous evaluation paired with better interpretability is an important step towards the acceptance of neural-network-based control approaches for real-world systems.

As a result, many machine learning techniques are still limited to being used in situations where safety and robustness are not critical for success. One way to overcome this difficulty is by using reachability analysis, which can be used to compute regions of the state space, known as reachable sets, from which the system can be guaranteed to remain safe over some time horizon regardless of the disturbances. In this paper we show how reachability analysis can be combined with machine learning in a scenario in which an aerial robot is attempting to learn the dynamics of a ground vehicle using a camera with a limited field of view. The resulting simulation data shows that by combining these two paradigms, one can create robotic systems that feature the best qualities of each, namely high performance and guaranteed safety.","",""
