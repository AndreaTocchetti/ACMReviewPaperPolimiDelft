Foolbox is a popular Python library to benchmark the robustness of machine learning models against these adversarial perturbations. It comes with a huge collection of state-of-the-art adversarial attacks to find adversarial perturbations and thanks to its framework-agnostic design it is ideally suited for comparing the robustness of many different models implemented in different frameworks. Foolbox 3 aka Foolbox Native has been rewritten from scratch to achieve native performance on models developed in PyTorch (Paszke et al., 2019), TensorFlow (Abadi et al., 2016), and JAX (Bradbury et al., 2018), all with one codebase without code duplication.","",""

We evaluate seven widely used machine-learning methods using a series of two large-scale field experiments. The first field experiment generates a common pool of training data for each of the seven methods. We then validate the seven optimized policies provided by each method together with uniform benchmark policies in a second field experiment. The findings not only compare the performance of the targeting methods, but also demonstrate how well the methods address common data challenges. Our results reveal that when the training data are ideal, model-driven methods perform better than distance-driven methods and classification methods. However, the performance advantage vanishes in the presence of challenges that affect the quality of the training data, including the extent to which the training data captures details of the implementation setting. The challenges we study are covariate shift, concept shift, information loss through aggregation, and imbalanced data. Intuitively, the model-driven methods make better use of the information available in the training data, but the performance of these methods is more sensitive to deterioration in the quality of this information. The classification methods we tested performed relatively poorly. We explain the poor performance of the classification methods in our setting and describe how the performance of these methods could be improved.

Due to de-identification requirements, however, current experimental practices for public EHR benchmarks (such as the MIMIC-III critical care dataset) are time agnostic, assigning care records to train or test sets without regard for the actual dates of care. As a result, current benchmarks cannot assess how well models trained on one year generalise to another. In this work, we obtain a Limited Data Use Agreement to access year of care for each record in MIMIC and show that all tested state-of-the-art models decay in prediction quality when trained on historical data and tested on future data, particularly in response to a system-wide record-keeping change in 2008 (0.29 drop in AUROC for mortality prediction, 0.10 drop in AUROC for length-of-stay prediction with a random forest classifier). We further develop a simple yet effective mitigation strategy: by aggregating raw features into expert-defined clinical concepts, we see only a 0.06 drop in AUROC for mortality prediction and a 0.03 drop in AUROC for length-of-stay prediction. We demonstrate that this aggregation strategy outperforms other automatic feature preprocessing techniques aimed at increasing robustness to data drift.

Conversely, AM techniques require no or minimal training, hence exhibiting the potential for supporting prompt instantiation of the performance model of the target system. However, in order to ensure their tractability, they typically rely on a set of simplifying assumptions. Consequently, AM's accuracy can be seriously challenged in scenarios (e.g., workload conditions) in which such assumptions are not matched.

We analyzed the underlying issues and suggest that the main causes of the overfitting problem include that the numbers of training cases were too small, and the features used in the models were not sufficiently informative for the task.

This article provides clinical examples in which machine learning and artificial intelligence are already in use in health care and appear to deliver benefit. Three key bottlenecks toward increasing the pace of diffusion and adoption are methodological issues in evaluation of artificial intelligence-based interventions, reporting standards to enable assessment of model performance, and issues that need to be addressed for an institution to adopt these interventions. Methodological best practices will include external validation, ideally at a different site; use of proactive learning algorithms to correct for site-specific biases and increase robustness as algorithms are deployed across multiple sites; addressing subgroup performance; and communicating to providers the uncertainty of predictions. Regarding reporting, especially important issues are the extent to which implementing standardized approaches for introducing clinical decision support has been followed, describing the data sources, reporting on data assumptions, and addressing biases. Although most health care organizations in the United States have adopted electronic health records, they may be ill prepared to adopt machine learning and artificial intelligence. Several steps can enable this: preparing data, developing tools to get suggestions to clinicians in useful ways, and getting clinicians engaged in the process.

We apply Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM), a domain generalization algorithm that employs a causal discovery inspired method to find robust predictors, to the task of fairly predicting the toxicity of internet comments. We show that IRM achieves better out-of-distribution accuracy and fairness than Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) methods, and analyze both the difficulties that arise when applying IRM in practice and the conditions under which IRM will likely be effective in this scenario.

In this paper, we introduce the notion of the boundary thickness of a classifier, and we describe its connection with and usefulness for model robustness. Thick decision boundaries lead to improved performance, while thin decision boundaries lead to overfitting (e.g., measured by the robust generalization gap between training and testing) and lower robustness. We show that a thicker boundary helps improve robustness against adversarial examples (e.g., improving the robust test accuracy of adversarial training) as well as so-called out-of-distribution (OOD) transforms, and we show that many commonly-used regularization and data augmentation procedures can increase boundary thickness. On the theoretical side, we establish that maximizing boundary thickness during training is akin to the so-called mixup training. Using these observations, we show that noise-augmentation on mixup training further increases boundary thickness, thereby combating vulnerability to various forms of adversarial attacks and OOD transforms. We can also show that the performance improvement in several lines of recent work happens in conjunction with a thicker boundary.","",""

To address this deficiency, a novel activation function with an affine transformation (AT) on its input is introduced into the ELM, which leads to an improved ELM algorithm that is referred to as an AT-ELM in this paper. The scaling and translation parameters of the AT activation function are computed based on the maximum entropy principle in such a way that the hidden layer outputs approximately obey a uniform distribution. Application of the AT-ELM algorithm in nonlinear function regression shows its robustness to the range scaling of the network inputs. Experiments on nonlinear function regression, real-world data set classification, and benchmark image recognition demonstrate better performance for the AT-ELM compared with the original ELM, the regularized ELM, and the kernel ELM.

Here we ask: Are we making progress in closing the gap between human and machine vision? To answer this question, we tested human observers on a broad range of out-ofdistribution (OOD) datasets, recording 85,120 psychophysical trials across 90 participants. We then investigated a range of promising machine learning developments that crucially deviate from standard supervised CNNs along three axes: objective function (self-supervised, adversarially trained, CLIP language-image training), architecture (e.g. vision transformers), and dataset size (ranging from 1M to 1B). Our findings are threefold. (1.) The longstanding distortion robustness gap between humans and CNNs is closing, with the best models now exceeding human feedforward performance on most of the investigated OOD datasets. (2.) There is still a substantial image-level consistency gap, meaning that humans make different errors than models. In contrast, most models systematically agree in their categorisation errors, even substantially different ones like contrastive self-supervised vs. standard supervised models. (3.) In many cases, human-to-model consistency improves when training dataset size is increased by one to three orders of magnitude. Our results give reason for cautious optimism: While there is still much room for improvement, the behavioural difference between human and machine vision is narrowing.

In fact, the 3D model retrieval algorithm consists of feature extraction and similarity measurement, and the robust features play a decisive role in the similarity measurement. Although deep learning has achieved comprehensive success in the field of computer vision, deep learning features are used for 3D model retrieval only in a small number of works. To the best of our knowledge, there is no benchmark to evaluate these deep learning features. To tackle this problem, in this work we systematically evaluate the performance of deep learning features in view-based 3D model retrieval on four popular datasets (ETH, NTU60, PSB, and MVRED) by different kinds of similarity measure methods. In detail, the performance of hand-crafted features and deep learning features are compared, and then the robustness of deep learning features is assessed. Finally, the difference between single-view deep learning features and multi-view deep learning features is also evaluated. By quantitatively analyzing the performances on different datasets, it is clear that these deep learning features can consistently outperform all of the hand-crafted features, and they are also more robust than the hand-crafted features when different degrees of noise are added into the image. The exploration of latent relationships among different views in multi-view deep learning network architectures shows that the performance of multi-view deep learning outperforms that of single-view deep learning features with low computational complexity.","",""

The commonly adopted static hypothesis testing for physical layer authentication faces significant challenges in time-varying communication channels due to the changing propagation and interference conditions, which are typically unknown at the design stage. To circumvent this impediment, we propose an adaptive physical layer authentication scheme based on machine-learning as an intelligent process to learn and utilize the complex time-varying environment, and hence to improve the reliability and robustness of physical layer authentication. Explicitly, a physical layer attribute fusion model based on a kernel machine is designed for dealing with multiple attributes without requiring the knowledge of their statistical properties. By modeling the physical layer authentication as a linear system, the proposed technique directly reduces the authentication scope from a combined  $N$ -dimensional feature space to a single-dimensional (scalar) space, hence leading to reduced authentication complexity. By formulating the learning (training) objective of the physical layer authentication as a convex problem, an adaptive algorithm based on kernel least mean square is then proposed as an intelligent process to learn and track the variations of multiple attributes, and therefore to enhance the authentication performance. Both the convergence and the authentication performance of the proposed intelligent authentication process are theoretically analyzed. Our simulations demonstrate that our solution significantly improves the authentication performance in time-varying environments.","",""

However, recent research on DNNs has indicated ever-increasing concern on the robustness to adversarial examples, especially for security-critical tasks such as traffic sign identification for autonomous driving. Studies have unveiled the vulnerability of a well-trained DNN by demonstrating the ability of generating barely noticeable (to both human and machines) adversarial images that lead to misclassification. Furthermore, researchers have shown that these adversarial images are highly transferable by simply training and attacking a substitute model built upon the target model, known as a black-box attack to DNNs. Similar to the setting of training substitute models, in this paper we propose an effective black-box attack that also only has access to the input (images) and the output (confidence scores) of a targeted DNN. However, different from leveraging attack transferability from substitute models, we propose zeroth order optimization (ZOO) based attacks to directly estimate the gradients of the targeted DNN for generating adversarial examples. We use zeroth order stochastic coordinate descent along with dimension reduction, hierarchical attack and importance sampling techniques to efficiently attack black-box models. By exploiting zeroth order optimization, improved attacks to the targeted DNN can be accomplished, sparing the need for training substitute models and avoiding the loss in attack transferability. Experimental results on MNIST, CIFAR10 and ImageNet show that the proposed ZOO attack is as effective as the state-of-the-art white-box attack (e.g., Carlini and Wagner's attack) and significantly outperforms existing black-box attacks via substitute models.","",""

Hence, the current study compared between cut-off point and machine learning algorithms, for optimal quantification of sedentary behaviour and physical activity intensities in the elderly. Thus, in a heterogeneous sample of forty participants (aged ≥60 years, 50% female) energy expenditure during laboratory-based activities (ranging from sedentary behaviour through to moderate-to-vigorous physical activity) was estimated by indirect calorimetry, whilst wearing triaxial thigh-mounted accelerometers. Three cut-off point algorithms and a Random Forest machine learning model were developed and cross-validated using the collected data. Detailed analyses were performed to check algorithm robustness, and examine and benchmark both overall and participant-specific balanced accuracies. This revealed that the four models can at least be used to confidently monitor sedentary behaviour and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. Nevertheless, the machine learning algorithm outperformed the cut-off point models by being robust for all individual’s physiological and non-physiological characteristics and showing more performance of an acceptable level over the whole range of physical activity intensities. Therefore, we propose that Random Forest machine learning may be optimal for objective assessment of sedentary behaviour and physical activity in older adults using thigh-mounted triaxial accelerometry.","",""

Support vector machine (SVM) classifiers are widely applied to hyperspectral image (HSI) classification and provide significant advantages in terms of accuracy, simplicity, and robustness. SVM is a well-known learning algorithm that maximizes the minimum margin. However, recent theoretical results pointed out that maximizing the minimum margin leads to a lower generalization performance than optimizing the margin distribution, and proved that the margin distribution is more important. In this paper, a large margin distribution machine (LDM) is applied to HSI classification, and optimizing the margin distribution achieves a better generalization performance than SVM. Since the raw HSI feature space is not the most effective space for representing HSI, we adopt factor analysis to learn an effective HSI feature and the learned features are further filtered by a structure-preserved filter to fully exploit the spatial structure information of HSI. The spatial structure information is integrated in the feature learning process to obtain a better HSI feature. Then we propose a multiclass LDM to classify the filtered HSI feature. Experimental results show that the proposed LDM with feature learning method achieves the classification performance of the state-of-the-art methods in terms of visual quality and three quantitative evaluations and indicates that LDM has a high generalization performance.","",""

Our approach requires neither an explicit body model nor prior labeling of body parts in the image. Instead, it recovers pose by direct nonlinear regression against shape descriptor vectors extracted automatically from image silhouettes. For robustness against local silhouette segmentation errors, silhouette shape is encoded by histogram-of-shape-contexts descriptors. We evaluate several different regression methods: ridge regression, relevance vector machine (RVM) regression, and support vector machine (SVM) regression over both linear and kernel bases. The RVMs provide much sparser regressors without compromising performance, and kernel bases give a small but worthwhile improvement in performance. The loss of depth and limb labeling information often makes the recovery of 3D pose from single silhouettes ambiguous. To handle this, the method is embedded in a novel regressive tracking framework, using dynamics from the previous state estimate together with a learned regression value to disambiguate the pose. We show that the resulting system tracks long sequences stably. For realism and good generalization over a wide range of viewpoints, we train the regressors on images resynthesized from real human motion capture data. The method is demonstrated for several representations of full body pose, both quantitatively on independent but similar test data and qualitatively on real image sequences. Mean angular errors of 4-6/spl deg/ are obtained for a variety of walking motions.","",""

The Doppler shift correlation value is used as classification features, which is extracted by using the correlation of the WiFi device’s antennas. Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is utilized for activity data classification because of its strong generalization ability and fast learning speed. We implement the WiAct prototype using commercial WiFi equipment and evaluate its performance in real-world environments. In the evaluation, WiAct achieves an average accuracy of 94.2% for distinguishing ten actions. We compare different experimental conditions and classification methods, and the results demonstrate its robustness.","",""

The objective of this paper is the relative comparison of six acquisition setups on an identical hand movement classification task, in order to help the researchers to choose the proper acquisition setup for their requirements. The acquisition setups are based on four different sEMG electrodes (including Otto Bock, Delsys Trigno, Cometa Wave + Dormo ECG and two Thalmic Myo armbands) and they were used to record more than 50 hand movements from intact subjects with a standardized acquisition protocol. The relative performance of the six sEMG acquisition setups is compared on 41 identical hand movements with a standardized feature extraction and data analysis pipeline aimed at performing hand movement classification. Comparable classification results are obtained with three acquisition setups including the Delsys Trigno, the Cometa Wave and the affordable setup composed of two Myo armbands. The results suggest that practical sEMG tests can be performed even when costs are relevant (e.g. in small laboratories, developing countries or use by children). All the presented datasets can be used for offline tests and their quality can easily be compared as the data sets are publicly available.","",""

On the other hand, Bayesian regression has rather automatic and robust methods to set learning parameters, but becomes quickly computationally infeasible for big and high-dimensional data sets. By reducing the complexity of Bayesian regression in the spirit of local model learning through variational approximations, we arrive at a novel algorithm that is computationally efficient and easy to initialize for robust learning.

The proposed models for river flow include support vector regression (SVR), a hybrid of SVR with a fruit fly optimization algorithm (FOA) (so-called FOASVR), and an M5 model tree (M5). Additionally, the influence of periodicity (π) on the forecasting enactment was examined. To assess the performance of the proposed models, different statistical meters were implemented, including root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), correlation coefficient (R), and Bayesian information criterion (BIC). Results showed that the FOASVR with RMSE (4.36 and 6.33 m3/s), MAE (2.40 and 3.71 m3/s) and R (0.82 and 0.81) values had the best performance in forecasting river flows at Babarud and Vaniar stations, respectively.

Overall findings indicated that, although both the FOASVR and M5 predicted the river flows in suitable accordance with observed river flows, the performance of the FOASVR was moderately better than the M5 and periodicity noticeably increased the performance of the models; consequently, FOASVR can be suggested as the most accurate method for forecasting river flows.","",""

Within classifier ensemble concept, decision tree based ensemble learners such as random forest (RF) (i.e. decision forest) and rotation forest (RotFor) have gained a great interest due to their robustness against conventional statistical methods. This study proposes canonical correlation forest (CCF), a new member of ensemble learning family, in the prediction of landslide susceptibility for Yenice district of Karabuk in Turkey. To test the robustness and suitability of the CCF method, its prediction performance was compared to two well-known machine learning ensemble algorithms, RF and RotFor, and a commonly used statistical method, the logistic regression (LR). Furthermore, the effects of variations in ratio of training/testing datasets were assessed on the performances of RF, CCF, RotFor and LR models using the root-mean square error (RMSE). The quality of resulting landslide susceptibility maps was evaluated using overall accuracy (OA), Kappa coefficient (KC), success rate curves and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Wilcoxon’s signed rank test was also applied to measure the statistical differences of the accuracies of susceptibility maps. The estimated area under curve (AUC) values for RF, CCF, RotFor and LR models were 0.982, 0.970, 0.966 and 0.826, respectively. It was clear that ensemble learning algorithms outperformed the LR method. The results also showed that selection of sampling ratio had significant effect on model performance of RF, CCF, RotFor and LR models, and the lowest RMSE values were estimated with the use of 70:30 ratio for training and test datasets.","",""

For robustness against local silhouette segmentation errors, silhouette shape is encoded by histogram-of-shape-contexts descriptors. For the main regression, we evaluate both regularized least squares and relevance vector machine (RVM) regressors over both linear and kernel bases. The RVM's provide much sparser regressors without compromising performance, and kernel bases give a small but worthwhile improvement in performance. For realism and good generalization with respect to viewpoints, we train the regressors on images resynthesized from real human motion capture data, and test it both quantitatively on similar independent test data, and qualitatively on a real image sequence.

In order to over come this shortcoming, the following work indicates a new architecture based on multilayer network framework. The significant contribution of this paper are as follows: 1) unlike existing multilayer ELM, in which hidden nodes are obtained randomly, in this paper all hidden layers with invertible functions are calculated by pulling the network output back and putting it into hidden layers. Thus, the feature learning is enriched by additional information, which results in better performance; 2) in contrast to the existing multilayer network methods, which are usually efficient for classification applications, the proposed architecture is implemented for dimension reduction and image reconstruction; and 3) unlike other iterative learning-based deep networks (DL), the hidden layers of the proposed method are obtained via four steps.

This brings two key problems - construction of good high-dimensional features and machine learning that scales well with respect to dimensionality. Depending on the classifier, high dimensionality may lead to problems with the lack of training data, infeasibly high complexity of training, degradation of generalization abilities, lack of robustness to cover source, and saturation of performance below its potential.

We present experimental results that demonstrate the merit of our frameworks in achieving significant robustness to outliers in noisy data classification where mislabeled training instances are in abundance. Experimental evaluation shows that the proposed approaches yield a more scalable online SVM algorithm with sparser models and less computational running time, both in the training and recognition phases, without sacrificing generalization performance.

First, the classical approach of image-based visual servoing (IBVS) for fixed-base manipulators is extended to WMRs and a control law with Lyapunov stability is determined. Second, in order to guarantee visibility of visual features, an innovative controller with machine learning using Q-learning is proposed, which can learn its behavior policy and autonomously improve its performance. Third, a hybrid controller for robust mobile manipulation is developed to integrate the IBVS controller and the Q-learning controller through a rule-based arbitrator. This is thought to be the first paper that integrates reinforcement learning or Q-learning with visual servoing to achieve robust operation. Experiments are carried out to validate the approaches developed in this paper.

Despite a few differences between the AUC values, the BN model with an AUC value of 0.96 was dominant over the other models in predicting future fires. The second best was the DT model (AUC = 0.94), followed by the NB (AUC = 0.939), and MLR (AUC = 0.937) models. Our robust analysis demonstrated that these models are sufficiently robust in response to the training and validation datasets change. Further, the results revealed that moderate to high levels of fire susceptibilities are associated with ~19% of the Pu Mat National Park where human activities are numerous. This study and the resultant susceptibility maps provide a basis for developing more efficient fire-fighting strategies and reorganizing policies in favor of sustainable management of forest resources.","",""

Therefore, the future of human movement analysis requires procedures that enhance the classification of movement patterns into relevant groups and support practitioners in their decisions. In this regard, the use of data-driven techniques seems to be particularly suitable to generate classification models. Recently, an increasing emphasis on machine-learning applications has led to a significant contribution, e.g., in increasing the classification performance. In order to ensure the generalizability of the machine-learning models, different data preprocessing steps are usually carried out to process the measured raw data before the classifications. In the past, various methods have been used for each of these preprocessing steps. However, there are hardly any standard procedures or rather systematic comparisons of these different methods and their impact on the classification performance. Therefore, the aim of this analysis is to compare different combinations of commonly applied data preprocessing steps and test their effects on the classification performance of gait patterns. A publicly available dataset on intra-individual changes of gait patterns was used for this analysis. Forty-two healthy participants performed 6 sessions of 15 gait trials for 1 day. For each trial, two force plates recorded the three-dimensional ground reaction forces (GRFs). The data was preprocessed with the following steps: GRF filtering, time derivative, time normalization, data reduction, weight normalization and data scaling. Subsequently, combinations of all methods from each preprocessing step were analyzed by comparing their prediction performance in a six-session classification using Support Vector Machines, Random Forest Classifiers, Multi-Layer Perceptrons, and Convolutional Neural Networks. The results indicate that filtering GRF data and a supervised data reduction (e.g., using Principal Components Analysis) lead to increased prediction performance of the machine-learning classifiers. Interestingly, the weight normalization and the number of data points (above a certain minimum) in the time normalization does not have a substantial effect. In conclusion, the present results provide first domain-specific recommendations for commonly applied data preprocessing methods and might help to build more comparable and more robust classification models based on machine learning that are suitable for a practical application.","",""

Background: Modern causal inference methods allow machine learning to be used to weaken parametric modeling assumptions. However, the use of machine learning may result in complications for inference. Doubly robust cross-fit estimators have been proposed to yield better statistical properties. Methods: We conducted a simulation study to assess the performance of several different estimators for the average causal effect. The data generating mechanisms for the simulated treatment and outcome included log-transforms, polynomial terms, and discontinuities. We compared singly robust estimators (g-computation, inverse probability weighting) and doubly robust estimators (augmented inverse probability weighting, targeted maximum likelihood estimation). We estimated nuisance functions with parametric models and ensemble machine learning separately. We further assessed doubly robust cross-fit estimators. Results: With correctly specified parametric models, all of the estimators were unbiased and confidence intervals achieved nominal coverage. When used with machine learning, the doubly robust cross-fit estimators substantially outperformed all of the other estimators in terms of bias, variance, and confidence interval coverage. Conclusions: Due to the difficulty of properly specifying parametric models in high-dimensional data, doubly robust estimators with ensemble learning and cross-fitting may be the preferred approach for estimation of the average causal effect in most epidemiologic studies. However, these approaches may require larger sample sizes to avoid finite-sample issues.","",""

The aim of the present work is to make an attempt of providing a review of existing and also new approaches within this field as well as to present some known results in a unified framework; no claim of completeness is made. As a concrete example of machine learning enhanced DDMs, an approach is presented which uses neural networks to reduce the computational effort in adaptive DDMs while retaining their robustness. More precisely, deep neural networks are used to predict the geometric location of constraints which are needed to define a robust coarse space. Additionally, two recently published deep domain decomposition approaches are presented in a unified framework. Both approaches use physics‐constrained neural networks to replace the discretization and solution of the subdomain problems of a given decomposition of the computational domain. Finally, a brief overview is given of several further approaches which combine machine learning with ideas from DDMs to either increase the performance of already existing algorithms or to create completely new methods.","",""

As such, numerous authors have advocated for ML methods to estimate causal effects. Unfortunately, ML algorithmscan perform worse than parametric regression. We demonstrate the performance of ML-based single- and double-robust estimators. We use 100 Monte Carlo samples with sample sizes of 200, 1200, and 5000 to investigate bias and confidence interval coverage under several scenarios. In a simple confounding scenario, confounders were related to the treatment and the outcome via parametric models. In a complex confounding scenario, the simple confounders were transformed to induce complicated nonlinear relationships. In the simple scenario, when ML algorithms were used, double-robust estimators were superior to single-robust estimators. In the complex scenario, single-robust estimators with ML algorithms were at least as biased as estimators using misspecified parametric models. Double-robust estimators were less biased, but coverage was well below nominal. The use of sample splitting, inclusion of confounder interactions, reliance on a richly specified ML algorithm, and use of doubly robust estimators was the only explored approach that yielded negligible bias and nominal coverage. Our results suggest that ML based singly robust methods should be avoided.","",""

While machine learning algorithms offer a proven way of modeling non-linearities in time series, their advantages against common stochastic models in the domain of financial market prediction are largely based on limited empirical results. The same holds true for determining advantages of certain machine learning architectures against others. This study surveys more than 150 related articles on applying machine learning to financial market forecasting. Based on a comprehensive literature review, we build a table across seven main parameters describing the experiments conducted in these studies. Through listing and classifying different algorithms, we also introduce a simple, standardized syntax for textually representing machine learning algorithms. Based on performance metrics gathered from papers included in the survey, we further conduct rank analyses to assess the comparative performance of different algorithm classes. Our analysis shows that machine learning algorithms tend to outperform most traditional stochastic methods in financial market forecasting. We further find evidence that, on average, recurrent neural networks outperform feed forward neural networks as well as support vector machines which implies the existence of exploitable temporal dependencies in financial time series across multiple asset classes and geographies.","",""

Low-cost sensing strategies hold the promise of denser air quality monitoring networks, which could significantly improve our understanding of personal air pollution exposure. Additionally, low-cost air quality sensors could be deployed to areas where limited monitoring exists. However, low-cost sensors are frequently sensitive to environmental conditions and pollutant cross-sensitivities, which have historically been poorly addressed by laboratory calibrations, limiting their utility for monitoring. In this study, we investigated different calibration models for the Real-time Affordable Multi-Pollutant (RAMP) sensor package, which measures CO, NO2, O3, and CO2. We explored three methods: (1) laboratory univariate linear regression, (2) empirical multiple linear regression, and (3) machine-learning-based calibration models using random forests (RF). Calibration models were developed for 16–19 RAMP monitors (varied by pollutant) using training and testing windows spanning August 2016 through February 2017 in Pittsburgh, PA, US. The random forest models matched (CO) or significantly outperformed (NO2, CO2, O3) the other calibration models, and their accuracy and precision were robust over time for testing windows of up to 16 weeks. Following calibration, average mean absolute error on the testing data set from the random forest models was 38 ppb for CO (14 % relative error), 10 ppm for CO2 (2 % relative error), 3.5 ppb for NO2 (29 % relative error), and 3.4 ppb for O3 (15 % relative error), and Pearson r versus the reference monitors exceeded 0.8 for most units. Model performance is explored in detail, including a quantification of model variable importance, accuracy across different concentration ranges, and performance in a range of monitoring contexts including the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and the US EPA Air Sensors Guidebook recommendations of minimum data quality for personal exposure measurement. A key strength of the RF approach is that it accounts for pollutant cross-sensitivities. This highlights the importance of developing multipollutant sensor packages (as opposed to single-pollutant monitors); we determined this is especially critical for NO2 and CO2. The evaluation reveals that only the RF-calibrated sensors meet the US EPA Air Sensors Guidebook recommendations of minimum data quality for personal exposure measurement. We also demonstrate that the RF-model-calibrated sensors could detect differences in NO2 concentrations between a near-road site and a suburban site less than 1.5 km away. From this study, we conclude that combining RF models with carefully controlled state-of-the-art multipollutant sensor packages as in the RAMP monitors appears to be a very promising approach to address the poor performance that has plagued low-cost air quality sensors.","",""
