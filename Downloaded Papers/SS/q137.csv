The multivariable nonlinear systems under consideration have both matched and mismatched uncertainties, which satisfy the semiglobal Lipschitz condition. The nonlinear uncertainties are approximated by a Gaussian radial basis function (GRBF)‐based neural network incorporated with a piecewise constant adaptive law, where the adaptive law will generate adaptive parameters by solving the error dynamics between the real system and the state predictor with the neglection of unknowns. The combination of GRBF‐based neural network and piecewise constant adaptive law relaxes hardware limitations (CPU). A filtering control law is designed to handle the nonlinear uncertainties and deliver a good tracking performance with guaranteed robustness. The matched uncertainties are cancelled directly by adopting their opposite in the control signal, whereas a dynamic inversion of the system is required to eliminate the effect of the mismatched uncertainties on the output. Since the virtual reference system defines the best performance that can be achieved by the closed‐loop system, the uniform performance bounds are derived for the states and control signals via comparison. To validate the theoretical findings, comparisons between the model reference adaptive control method and the proposed filtering adaptive neural network control architecture with the implementation of different sampling time are carried out.","",""

Traditional ARA controllers need the availability of a high-precision model to avoid high control chattering. Furthermore, in practical applications of aerial object manipulation, the payloads that ARAs can handle vary, depending on the nature of the task. The high uncertainties due to modeling errors and an unknown payload are inversely proportional to the stability of ARAs. To address the issue of stability, a new adaptive robust controller, based on the Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural network, is proposed. A three-tier approach is also followed. Firstly, a detailed new model for the ARA is derived using the Lagrange–d'Alembert principle. Secondly, an adaptive robust controller, based on a sliding mode, is designed to manipulate the problem of uncertainties, including modeling errors. Last, a higher stability controller, based on the RBF neural network, is implemented with the adaptive robust controller to stabilize the ARAs, avoiding modeling errors and unknown payload issues. The novelty of the proposed design is that it takes into account high nonlinearities, coupling control loops, high modeling errors, and disturbances due to payloads and environmental conditions. The model was evaluated by the simulation of a case study that includes the two proposed controllers and ARA trajectory tracking. The simulation results show the validation and notability of the presented control algorithm.","",""

The ARNNC control framework integrates adaptive control, robust control, and neural network control intelligently. Adaptive control improves the precision of dynamic compensation with parametric estimation, and robust control attenuates the effect of unmodeled dynamics and unknown disturbances. In reality, the unmodeled dynamics of the complicated pneumatic systems and unpredictable disturbances in working conditions affect the tracking precision. However, these cannot be expressed as an exact formula. Therefore, the real-time learning radial basis function (RBF) neural network component is considered for better compensation of unmodeled dynamics, random disturbances, and estimation errors of the adaptive control. Although the bounds of the parameters and disturbances for the pneumatic systems are unknown, the prescribed transient performance and final tracking accuracy of the proposed method can be still achieved with fictitious bounds. Asymptotic tracking performance can be acquired under the provided circumstance.

Convolutional neural network has been successfully applied to many image processing problems in general and direction-of-arrival estimation in particular.

Second, fractional order control can increase the order of differential and integral, which greatly improves the flexibility of control method. The fractional-order controller has some advantages that integer-order systems cannot achieve, thus obtaining better control effects than that without adding fractional order control.

Here, we present a neural network approach that autonomously discovers reaction pathways from the time-resolved species concentration data. The proposed chemical reaction neural network (CRNN), by design, satisfies the fundamental physics laws, including the law of mass action and the Arrhenius law. Consequently, the CRNN is physically interpretable such that the reaction pathways can be interpreted, and the kinetic parameters can be quantified simultaneously from the weights of the neural network. The inference of the chemical pathways is accomplished by training the CRNN with species concentration data via stochastic gradient descent. We demonstrate the successful implementations and the robustness of the approach in elucidating the chemical reaction pathways of several chemical engineering and biochemical systems. The autonomous inference by the CRNN approach precludes the need for expert knowledge in proposing candidate networks and addresses the curse of dimensionality in complex systems. The physical interpretability also makes the CRNN capable of not only fitting the data for a given system but also developing knowledge of unknown pathways that could be generalized to similar chemical systems.","",""

The hyperbolic tangent function is used to design the sliding surface, and the course is controlled by sliding mode control.

Barron [1991] and Jones [1992] give bounds on the rate of approximation valid for Hilbert spaces. We derive bounds for L spaces, 1 < p < m, recovering the 0(1 /&) bounds of Barron and Jones for the case p = 2. The results were motivated in part by the desire to understand approximation in the more “robust” (resistant to exemplar noise) LP, 1 ~ p <2 norms. Consider the task of approximating a given target function f by a linear combination of n functions from a set S. For example, S may be the set of possible sigmoidal activation functions, {g : ~d ~[% 6 ~d, b E ~, s.t. g(z) = a(a . z + b)}, in which case the approximants are single hidden layer neural networks with a linear output layer. It is known that under very weak conditions on IS (it must be Riemann integrable and nonpolynomial), the linear span of S is dense in the set of continuous functions on compact subsets of ~d (i.e. for all positive c there is a linear combination of functions in S which can approximate any continuous function to within c everywhere on a compact domain) [Leshno et al. 1992]. Consider the important rate of approximation issue, i.e. the rate at which the achievable error reduces as we allow larger subsets of S to be used in const rutting the approximant. In the context of neural networks, this is the question of how the approximation error scales with the number of hidden units in the network. Unfortunately, approximation bounds for target functions ~ arbitrarily located in the linear closure (i.e. the closure of the span) of S are unknown.

Unlike other machine learning applications such as image recognition, where different inputs have a uniform and consistent format (e.g., an array of all the pixels in an image), the input for deformable simulation is quite variable, high-dimensional, and parametrization-unfriendly. Consequently, even though the neural network is known for its rich expressivity of nonlinear functions, directly using an NN to reconstruct the force-displacement relation for general deformable simulation is nearly impossible. NNWarp obviates this difficulty by partially restoring the force-displacement relation via warping the nodal displacement simulated using a simplistic constitutive model–the linear elasticity. In other words, NNWarp yields an incremental displacement fix per mesh node based on a simplified (therefore incorrect) simulation result other than synthesizing the unknown displacement directly. We introduce a compact yet effective feature vector including geodesic, potential and digression to sort training pairs of per-node linear and nonlinear displacement. NNWarp is robust under different model shapes and tessellations. With the assistance of deformation substructuring, one NN training is able to handle a wide range of 3D models of various geometries.

In this work, we take a ""virtual experimental"" approach to this problem. Simulating idealized neuroscience experiments with artificial neural networks, we generate a large-scale dataset of learning trajectories of aggregate statistics measured in a variety of neural network architectures, loss functions, learning rule hyperparameters, and parameter initializations. We then take a discriminative approach, training linear and simple non-linear classifiers to identify learning rules from features based on these observables. We show that different classes of learning rules can be separated solely on the basis of aggregate statistics of the weights, activations, or instantaneous layer-wise activity changes, and that these results generalize to limited access to the trajectory and held-out architectures and learning curricula. We identify the statistics of each observable that are most relevant for rule identification, finding that statistics from network activities across training are more robust to unit undersampling and measurement noise than those obtained from the synaptic strengths. Our results suggest that activation patterns, available from electrophysiological recordings of post-synaptic activities on the order of several hundred units, frequently measured at wider intervals over the course of learning, may provide a good basis on which to identify learning rules.","",""

In this research, a new convolutional neural network (CNN) model with data uncertainty handling; referred as NCNN (Neutrosophic Convolutional Neural Network); is proposed for classification task. Here, speech signals are used as input data and their noise is modeled as uncertainty. In this task, using speech spectrogram, a definition of uncertainty is proposed in neutrosophic (NS) domain. Uncertainty is computed for each Time-frequency point of speech spectrogram as like a pixel. Therefore, uncertainty matrix with the same size of spectrogram is created in NS domain. In the next step, a two parallel paths CNN classification model is proposed. Speech spectrogram is used as input of the first path and uncertainty matrix for the second path. The outputs of two paths are combined to compute the final output of the classifier. To show the effectiveness of the proposed method, it has been compared with conventional CNN on the isolated words of Aurora2 dataset. The proposed method achieves the average accuracy of 85.96 in noisy train data. It is more robust against noises with accuracies 90, 88 and 81 in test sets A, B and C, respectively. Results show that the proposed method outperforms conventional CNN with the improvement of 6, 5 and 2 percentage in test set A, test set B and test sets C, respectively.

Using the NNs to compensate the unknown aerodynamic forces online and the robust adaptive mechanism to cancel the combination of the overlarge NNs compensation error and the external disturbances, the new robust neural identifier exhibits a better identification performance in the complex flight environment. Moreover, an optimized algorithm is included in the NNs mechanism to alleviate the burdensome online computation.

Uncertainty in the worst case requires a large state-action space. Hence, it is natural to use continuous-time RL methods rather than the discretisation of the spaces. In this paper, we propose a novel continuous-time RL using neural network approximation. Our method uses worst-case uncertainty to train the continuous-time RL algorithm. The backward Euler approximation is used to approximate the time derivative of the value function. Compared with the actor–critic (AC) algorithm, our method finds the robust control policy in the presence of worst-case uncertainty by taking into account the applied actions. It is shown that the AC algorithm finds the robust controller in less episodes, but its robustness is less than the results presented by our approach. The convergence of the proposed algorithm is analysed using the contraction property and differential equation techniques. The experiments show that our approach is more robust than the model-based LQR method and the well-known AC method.","",""

The results from a number of benchmark tests show that simple signals such as dc, staircase dc, and sinusoidal signals embedded within high noise can be accurately filtered and particle swarm optimization can be employed to select model parameters. The RQNN filtering procedure is applied in a two-class motor imagery-based brain-computer interface where the objective was to filter electroencephalogram (EEG) signals before feature extraction and classification to increase signal separability.

However, deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples. Adversarial examples are samples created by adding a small amount of noise to an original data sample in such a way that to human perception they appear to be normal data but they will be incorrectly classified by the classification model. Adversarial examples pose a significant threat in the medical field, as they can cause models to misidentify or misclassify patient diagnoses. In this paper, I propose an advanced adversarial training method to defend against such adversarial examples. An advantage of the proposed method is that it creates a wide variety of adversarial examples for use in training, which are generated by the fast gradient sign method (FGSM) for a range of epsilon values. A U-Net model trained on these diverse adversarial examples will be more robust to unknown adversarial examples.

Then, the localization of sensor nodes has become an essential requirement for many applications over WSN. Meanwhile, the localization information of unknown nodes has strongly affected the performance of WSN. The received signal strength indication (RSSI) as a typical range-based algorithm for positioning sensor nodes in WSN could achieve accurate location with hardware saving, but is sensitive to environmental noises. Moreover, the original distance vector hop (DV-HOP) as an important range-free localization algorithm is simple, inexpensive and not related to the environment factors, but performs poorly when lacking anchor nodes. Motivated by these, various improved DV-HOP schemes with RSSI have been introduced, and we present a new neural network (NN)-based node localization scheme, named RHOP-ELM-RCC, through the use of DV-HOP, RSSI and a regularized correntropy criterion (RCC)-based extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm (ELM-RCC). Firstly, the proposed scheme employs both RSSI and DV-HOP to evaluate the distances between nodes to enhance the accuracy of distance estimation at a reasonable cost. Then, with the help of ELM featured with a fast learning speed with a good generalization performance and minimal human intervention, a single hidden layer feedforward network (SLFN) on the basis of ELM-RCC is used to implement the optimization task for obtaining the location of unknown nodes. Since the RSSI may be influenced by the environmental noises and may bring estimation error, the RCC instead of the mean square error (MSE) estimation, which is sensitive to noises, is exploited in ELM. Hence, it may make the estimation more robust against outliers. Additionally, the least square estimation (LSE) in ELM is replaced by the half-quadratic optimization technique.

Due to the fact that these environments can grow even more over time, applications related to their monitoring tend to turn to autonomous intelligent systems, which together with remote sensing data could help or even predict daily life situations. The task of mapping cities by autonomous operators was usually carried out by aerial optical images due to its scale and resolution; however new scientific questions have arisen, and this has led research into a new era of highly-detailed data extraction. For many years, using artificial neural models to solve complex problems such as automatic image classification was commonplace, owing much of their popularity to their ability to adapt to complex situations without needing human intervention. In spite of that, their popularity declined in the mid-2000s, mostly due to the complex and time-consuming nature of their methods and workflows. However, newer neural network architectures have brought back the interest in their application for autonomous classifiers, especially for image classification purposes. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have been a trend for pixel-wise image segmentation, showing flexibility when detecting and classifying any kind of object, even in situations where humans failed to perceive differences, such as in city scenarios. In this paper, we aim to explore and experiment with state-of-the-art technologies to semantically label 3D urban models over complex scenarios. To achieve these goals, we split the problem into two main processing lines: first, how to correctly label the façade features in the 2D domain, where a supervised CNN is used to segment ground-based façade images into six feature classes, roof, window, wall, door, balcony and shop; second, a Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Multi-View-Stereo (MVS) workflow is used to extract the geometry of the façade, wherein the segmented images in the previous stage are then used to label the generated mesh by a “reverse” ray-tracing technique. This paper demonstrates that the proposed methodology is robust in complex scenarios. The façade feature inferences have reached up to 93% accuracy over most of the datasets used. Although it still presents some deficiencies in unknown architectural styles and needs some improvements to be made regarding 3D-labeling, we present a consistent and simple methodology to handle the problem.","",""
