To address these issues, the IPS will then need to reason about the interactions with these items through time and space. Incorporating spatio-temporal reasoning into the IPS will provide the capability to understand these interactions.

Existing approaches to image analysis mostly process objects independently and do not take into account the relative occlusion of nearby objects. In this paper, we propose a deep network for multi-object instance segmentation that is robust to occlusion and can be trained from bounding box supervision only. Our work builds on Compositional Networks, which learn a generative model of neural feature activations to locate occluders and to classify objects based on their non-occluded parts. We extend their generative model to include multiple objects and introduce a framework for efficient inference in challenging occlusion scenarios. In particular, we obtain feed-forward predictions of the object classes and their instance and occluder segmentations. We introduce an Occlusion Reasoning Module (ORM) that locates erroneous segmentations and estimates the occlusion order to correct them. The improved segmentation masks are, in turn, integrated into the network in a top-down manner to improve the image classification. Our experiments on the KITTI INStance dataset (KINS) and a synthetic occlusion dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our model at multi-object instance segmentation under occlusion.

The fundamental idea behind the design of most neural networks is to learn similarity patterns from data for prediction and inference, which lacks the ability of cognitive reasoning. However, the concrete ability of reasoning is critical to many theoretical and practical problems. On the other hand, traditional symbolic reasoning methods do well in making logical inference, but they are mostly hard rule-based reasoning, which limits their generalization ability to different tasks since difference tasks may require different rules. Both reasoning and generalization ability are important for prediction tasks such as recommender systems, where reasoning provides strong connection between user history and target items for accurate prediction, and generalization helps the model to draw a robust user portrait over noisy inputs. In this paper, we propose Logic-Integrated Neural Network (LINN) to integrate the power of deep learning and logic reasoning. LINN is a dynamic neural architecture that builds the computational graph according to input logical expressions. It learns basic logical operations such as AND, OR, NOT as neural modules, and conducts propositional logical reasoning through the network for inference. Experiments on theoretical task show that LINN achieves significant performance on solving logical equations and variables. Furthermore, we test our approach on the practical task of recommendation by formulating the task into a logical inference problem. Experiments show that LINN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art recommendation models in Top-K recommendation, which verifies the potential of LINN in practice.","",""

Nevertheless, the heterogeneity covers abundant semantic information, which will help FV system identify misinformation in a more accurate way. The current work is the first attempt to make the combination of knowledge graph (KG) and graph neural network (GNN) to enhance the robustness of FV systems for heterogeneous information.

Although deep neural networks (DNN) have shown remarkable successes in many tasks, they are also criticized for the lack of interpretability and transparency. Interpreting a shared DNN model faces two additional challenges compared with interpreting a general model. (1) Limited training data can be disclosed to users. (2) The internal structure of the models may not be available. These two challenges impede the application of most existing interpretability approaches, such as saliency maps or influence functions, for DNN models. Case-based reasoning methods have been used for interpreting decisions; however, how to select and organize the data points under the constraints of shared DNN models is not discussed. Moreover, simply providing cases as explanations may not be sufficient for supporting instance level interpretability. Meanwhile, existing interpretation methods for DNN models generally lack the means to evaluate the reliability of the interpretation. In this article, we propose a framework named Shared Model INTerpreter (SMINT) to address the above limitations. We propose a new data structure called a boundary graph to organize training points to mimic the predictions of DNN models. We integrate local features, such as saliency maps and interpretable input masks, into the data structure to help users to infer the model decision boundaries. We show that the boundary graph is able to address the reliability issues in many local interpretation methods. We further design an algorithm named hidden-layer aware p-test to measure the reliability of the interpretations. Our experiments show that SMINT is able to achieve above 99% fidelity to corresponding DNN models on both MNIST and ImageNet by sharing only a tiny fraction of training data to make these models interpretable. The human pilot study demonstrates that SMINT provides better interpretability compared with existing methods.

Instead, it often involves a systematic deduction by ruling out other possible outcomes as a self-checking mechanism. In this paper, we describe the design of a hybrid neural network for logical learning that is similar to the human reasoning through the introduction of an auxiliary input, namely the indicators, that act as the hints to suggest logical outcomes. We generate these indicators by digging into the hidden information buried underneath the original training data for direct or indirect suggestions. We used the MNIST data to demonstrate the design and use of these indicators in a convolutional neural network. We trained a series of such hybrid neural networks with variations of the indicators. Our results show that these hybrid neural networks are very robust in generating logical outcomes with inherently higher prediction accuracy than the direct use of the original input and output in apparent models. Such improved predictability with reassured logical confidence is obtained through the exhaustion of all possible indicators to rule out all illogical outcomes, which is not available in the apparent models. Our logical learning process can effectively cope with the unknown unknowns using a full exploitation of all existing knowledge available for learning. The design and implementation of the hints, namely the indicators, become an essential part of artificial intelligence for logical learning.

Even though several projects have been launched in the pursuit of developing a universal meaning representation language, the existence of an accurate universal parser is far from reality. This has severely limited the application of knowledge representation and reasoning (KR) in the field of NLP and also prevented a proper evaluation of KR based NLU systems. Our goal is to build KR based systems for Natural Language Understanding without relying on a parser. Towards this we propose a method named Deeply Embedded Knowledge Representation & Reasoning (DeepEKR) where we replace the parser by a neural network, soften the symbolic representation so that a deterministic mapping exists between the parser neural network and the interpretable logical form, and finally replace the symbolic solver by an equivalent neural network, so the model can be trained end-to-end. We evaluate our method with respect to the task of Qualitative Word Problem Solving on the two available datasets (QuaRTz and QuaRel). Our system achieves same accuracy as that of the state-of-the-art accuracy on QuaRTz, outperforms the state-of-the-art on QuaRel and severely outperforms a traditional KR based system. The results show that the bias introduced by a KR solution does not prevent it from doing a better job at the end task. Moreover, our method is interpretable due to the bias introduced by the KR approach.","",""

The HTGA approach is a method of combining the traditional genetic algorithm (TGA), which has a powerful global exploration capability, with the Taguchi method, which can exploit the optimum offspring. The Taguchi method is inserted between crossover and mutation operations of a TGA. Then, the systematic reasoning ability of the Taguchi method is incorporated in the crossover operations to select the better genes to achieve crossover, and consequently enhance the genetic algorithms. Therefore, the HTGA approach can be more robust, statistically sound, and quickly convergent. First, the authors evaluate the performance of the presented HTGA approach by studying some global numerical optimization problems. Then, the presented HTGA approach is effectively applied to solve three examples on forecasting the sunspot numbers, tuning the associative memory, and solving the XOR problem. The numbers of hidden nodes and the links of the feedforward neural network are chosen by increasing them from small numbers until the learning performance is good enough. As a result, a partially connected feedforward neural network can be obtained after tuning. This implies that the cost of implementation of the neural network can be reduced. In these studied problems of tuning both network structure and parameters of a feedforward neural network, there are many parameters and numerous local optima so that these studied problems are challenging enough for evaluating the performances of any proposed GA-based approaches. The computational experiments show that the presented HTGA approach can obtain better results than the existing method reported recently in the literature.","",""

We find that the critical factor for inducing such a capacity is not an elaborate architecture, but rather, careful attention to the choice of data and the manner in which it is presented to the model. The most robust capacity for analogical reasoning is induced when networks learn analogies by contrasting abstract relational structures in their input domains, a training method that uses only the input data to force models to learn about important abstract features.

Relation networks (RNs), a kind of architectures for relational reasoning, can acquire a deep metric ability for images by just being designed as a simple convolutional neural network (CNN)[23].

The idea behind this thesis is to propose a robust cost estimation framework that takes both managerial aspects of uncertainty management and technical methodologies of conceptual cost estimation technologies into account. Especially artificial intelligence as a decision support system for assisting the decision makers to estimate the cost with a less degree of uncertainty, whereas the magnitude and number of projects with cost overruns would be reduced. The framework asserts that cost development in different phases of project life cycle and each decision gate can be learnt by artificial neural network, and a case-based reasoning system can assist the artificial neural network to choose the most similar case in its training data set. A case study confirmed the assertion of the thesis framework, and the results show that the applicability of artificial neural network in learning complex and nonlinear relationship between inputs of it network which are ?the project phase? and ?the degree of cost development? in that phase, with even very limited training data set is very promising, therefore we can expect that by providing a well documented and structured historical project data in the case based of Case-based reasoning system the accuracy of estimation would increase.","",""

Our recently introduced CMRNet effectively addresses this limitation by enabling map independent monocular localization in LiDAR-maps. In this paper, we now take it a step further by introducing CMRNet++, which is a significantly more robust model that not only generalizes to new places effectively, but is also independent of the camera parameters. We enable this capability by combining deep learning with geometric techniques, and by moving the metric reasoning outside the learning process. In this way, the weights of the network are not tied to a specific camera.

The arguments are the poor comprehensibility of the learned ANN, and the inability to represent explanation structures.    The overall objective of this thesis is to address these issues by: (1) explanation of the decision process in ANNs in the form of symbolic rules (predicate rules with variables); and (2) provision of explanatory capability by mapping the general conceptual knowledge that is learned by the neural networks into a knowledge base to be used in a rule-based reasoning system.    A multi-stage methodology GYAN is developed and evaluated for the task of extracting knowledge from the trained ANNs. The extracted knowledge is represented in the form of restricted first-order logic rules, and subsequently allows user interaction by interfacing with a knowledge based reasoner. The performance of GYAN is demonstrated using a number of real world and artificial data sets. The empirical results demonstrate that: (1) an equivalent symbolic interpretation is derived describing the overall behaviour of the ANN with high accuracy and fidelity, and (2) a concise explanation is given (in terms of rules, facts and predicates activated in a reasoning episode) as to why a particular instance is being classified into a certain category.","",""

On the other hand, neural networks can perform pattern recognition operations even in noisy environments. Against this background, we have implemented a neural expert system shell NEULA, whose computational mechanism processes imprecisely or incompletely given information by means of approximate probabilistic reasoning. 1 Background Most current artiicial intelligence systems are incapable of handling imprecise and incomplete information. This is a serious drawback, as in most cases it is a totally hopeless task for a programmer to capture all knowledge of the environment. Much research eeort has been expended to improve the robust-ness of artiicial intelligence programs, but very little progress has been made. On the other hand, current neural network research indicates that it is possible to perform pattern recognition operations, such as categorization, even in very noisy environments. We have therefore investigated the interesting question of whether the robustness problem of traditional artiicial intelligence applications can be attacked by neurally inspired techniques for knowledge representation. Inspired by the general idea of hybrid neural-symbolic systems (e.g. 4]), we have introduced in the NEULOG 1 project a knowledge representation scheme for robust storing of hierarchically related concepts. The scheme is based on a neural representation structure , which bears resemblance to a semantic network. However, instead of the traditional artiicial intelligence interpretation of the network as a purely syntactic variant of rst-order predicate calculus, the network performs computations implementing a Bayesian reasoning model, which is capable of inference in the presence of incomplete, imprecise and even inconsistent information .","",""

The neural network has powerful abilities for learning, optimization and adaptation. A combination of neural networks and fuzzy logic offers the possibility of solving tuning problems and design difficulties of fuzzy logic. Due to their complementary advantages, these two models are integrated together to form more robust learning systems, referred to as adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS).

This article argues, however, that there is an alternative reading of the Darwinian program that is both consistent with evolutionary theory and preserves the autonomy of aesthetic reasoning. This is that species evolve so as to attract the opposite sex by generating cognitive arousal, causing attention to be redirected to themselves. The methods for generating arousal are consistent with such aesthetic devices as prototypicality, harmony, and salience. A neural network model of face recognition is presented in which higher network activity results when these aesthetic goals are met. Data is then presented showing that arousal in this model when exposed to female faces is strongly correlated with male judgments of the same female faces. Furthermore, the proposed theory is consistent with the fact that women use a variety of makeup and adornment techniques to highlight their features. The article concludes by arguing that to be beautiful is a valid evolutionary goal in itself, because more beautiful organisms are more likely to attract the attention of the opposite sex and therefore mate.","",""

The key to RS-CNN is learning from relation, i.e., the geometric topology constraint among points. Specifically, the convolutional weight for local point set is forced to learn a high-level relation expression from predefined geometric priors, between a sampled point from this point set and the others. In this way, an inductive local representation with explicit reasoning about the spatial layout of points can be obtained, which leads to much shape awareness and robustness. With this convolution as a basic operator, RS-CNN, a hierarchical architecture can be developed to achieve contextual shape-aware learning for point cloud analysis. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks across three tasks verify RS-CNN achieves the state of the arts.","",""

The NN in the control law learns the system dynamics in an online manner, while the NN residual reconstruction errors and the bounded disturbances are overcome by the error sign signal. Since both of the NN output and the error sign signal are included in the integral, the continuity of the control input is ensured. The controller structure and the NN weight update law are novel in contrast with the previous effort, and the semiglobal asymptotic tracking performance is still guaranteed by using the Lyapunov analysis.

The first method is bidirectional propagation of errors, which the error propagation occurs in backward and forward directions.

To assess the performance of BL, we perform experiments using several architectures with fully and convolutional layers, with and without bias. Experimental results show that both methods improve robustness to white noise static and adversarial examples, and even increase accuracy, but have different behavior depending on the architecture and task, being more beneficial to use the one or the other.

Relation detection plays an important role in the KBQA system, which finds a compatible answer by analyzing the semantics of questions and querying and reasoning with multiple KB triples. Significant progress has been made by deep neural networks. However, existing methods often concern on detecting single-hop relation without path reasoning, and a few of these methods exploit the multihop relation reasoning, which involves the answer reasoning from the noisy and abundant relational paths in the KB. Meanwhile, the relatedness between question and answer candidates has received little attention and remains unsolved. This article proposes a novel knowledge-based reasoning network (KRN) for relation detection, including both single-hop relation and multihop relation. To address the semantic gap problem in question-answer interaction, we first learn attentive question representations according to the influence of answer aspects. Then, we learn the single-hop relation sequence through different levels of abstraction and adopt the KB entity and structure information to denoise the multihop relation detection task. Finally, we adopt a Siamese network to measure the similarity between question representation and relation representation for both single-hop and multihop relation KBQA tasks. We conduct experiments on two well-known benchmarks, SimpleQuestions and WebQSP, and the results show the superiority of our approach over the state-of-the-art models for both single-hop and multihop relation detection.

However, various working requirements and the oceanic environment may cause some uncertain and unfavorable factors for ship-mounted crane control. In particular, to accomplish different control tasks, some plant parameters (e.g., boom lengths, payload masses, and so on) frequently change; hence, most existing model-based controllers cannot ensure satisfactory control performance any longer. For example, inaccurate gravity compensation may result in positioning errors. Additionally, due to ship roll motions caused by sea waves, residual payload swing generally exists, which may result in safety risks in practice. To solve the above-mentioned issues, this paper designs a neural network-based adaptive control method that can provide effective control for both actuated and unactuated state variables based on the original nonlinear ship-mounted crane dynamics without any linearizing operations. In particular, the proposed update law availably compensates parameter/structure uncertainties for ship-mounted crane systems. Based on a 2-D sliding surface, the boom and rope can arrive at their preset positions in finite time, and the payload swing can be completely suppressed. Furthermore, the problem of nonlinear input dead zones is also taken into account. The stability of the equilibrium point of all state variables in ship-mounted crane systems is theoretically proven by a rigorous Lyapunov-based analysis.

This control strategy not only takes advantage of traditional PID, but also draws on the strong self-learning and adaptive ability of neural network and the online reasoning ability of fuzzy logic. Besides, it overcomes the disadvantage that traditional PID cannot obtain higher accuracy and stronger robustness, and realizes the online adjustment of controller parameters.

Most current solutions for this problem focus on annotating new occlusion data, introducing boundary estimation, and stacking deeper models to improve the robustness of neural networks. However, the performance degradation of models remains under extreme occlusion (i.e. average occlusion of over 50%) because of missing a large amount of facial context information. We argue that exploring neural networks to model the facial hierarchies is a more promising method for dealing with extreme occlusion. Surprisingly, in recent studies, little effort has been devoted to representing the facial hierarchies using neural networks. This paper proposes a new network architecture called GlomFace to model the facial hierarchies against various occlusions, which draws inspiration from the viewpoint-invariant hierarchy of facial structure. Specifically, GlomFace is functionally divided into two modules: the part-whole hierarchical module and the whole-part hierarchical module. The former captures the part-whole hierarchical dependencies of facial parts to suppress multi-scale occlusion information, whereas the latter injects structural reasoning into neural networks by building the whole-part hierarchical relations among facial parts. As a result, GlomFace has a clear topological interpretation due to its correspondence to the facial hierarchies. Extensive experimental results indicate that the proposed GlomFace performs comparably to existing state-of-the-art methods, especially in cases of extreme occlusion.

In many applications, feed-forward neural networks are heavily involved in the implementation of controllers by learning and representing control laws through several methods such as model predictive control (MPC) and reinforcement learning (RL). The type of networks that we consider in this manuscript are feed-forward neural networks consisting of multiple hidden layers with ReLU activation functions and a linear activation function in the output layer. While neural network controllers have been able to achieve desirable performance in many contexts, they also present a unique challenge in that it is difficult to provide any guarantees about the correctness of their behavior or reason about the stability a system that employs their use. Thus, from a controls perspective, it is necessary to verify them in conjunction with their corresponding plants in closed-loop. While there have been a handful of works proposed towards the verification of closed-loop systems with feed-forward neural network controllers, this area still lacks attention and a unified set of benchmark examples on which verification techniques can be evaluated and compared. Thus, to this end, we present a range of closed-loop control systems ranging from two to six state variables, and a range of controllers with sizes in the range of eleven neurons to a few hundred neurons in more complex systems.

In recent years, advances in Artficial Intelligence (AI) have enabled a diverse range of technologies that are directly impacting people’s everyday lives [16]. Particularly, within this space, machine learning methods such as Deep Learning (DL) have achieved levels of accuracy and performance that are competitive or better than humans for tasks such as pattern and image recognition [12], natural language processing [7], and knowledge representation and reasoning [15,22]. Despite these achievements, there have been reservations about incorporating them into safety critical systems [11] due to their susceptibility to unexpected and errant behavior from a slight perturbation in their inputs [18]. Furthermore, neural networks are often viewed as ""black boxes"" since the underlying operation of the neuron activations is often indiscernible [22]. In light of these challenges, there has been significant work towards the creation of methods and verification tools that can formally reason about the behavior of neural networks [22]. However, the vast majority of these techniques have only been able to deal with feed-forward neural networks with piecewise-linear activation functions [4]. Additionally, the bulk of these methods have primarily considered the verification of input-output properties of neural networks in isolation [22], and there are only a handful of works that have explicitly addressed the verification of closed-loop control systems with neural network controllers [5, 8, 19–21]. One of the central challenges in verifying neural network control systems is that applying existing methodology to these systems is not straightforward [9], and a simple combination of verification tools for non-linear ordinary differential equations along with a neural network reachability tool suffers from severe overestimation errors [5]. Still, the verification of closed loop neural network systems is deeply important as they naturally arise in safety critical systems [5] such as autonomous vehicles, and complex control systems that make use of model predictive control and reinforcement learning [16]. Thus, there is a compelling need for methods and advanced software tools that can effectively deal with the complexities exhibited by these systems [5]. Inspired by a shortage of verification methods for closed-loop neural network control systems in the research literature, the central contribution of this paper is the provision of a set of executable benchmarks that have been synthesized using methods such as reinforcement learning [17], and model predictive control [14]. The problems elucidated in the paper are modeled using Simulink/Stateflow (SLSF) and are available at the following github repository1. We aim to provide a thorough problem description to which the numerous tools and approaches for non-linear systems and neural network verification present in the research community can be evaluated and compared [22]. If the research community is able to devise acceptable solutions to the aformentioned challenges they will stimulate the development of robust and intelligent systems with the potential to bring unparalleled benefits to numerous application domains. 2 Description of benchmarks.

We further show that the model's ability to generalise improves markedly if it is trained to predict symbolic explanations for its answers. Altogether, we introduce and explore ways to both measure and induce stronger abstract reasoning in neural networks. Our freely-available dataset should motivate further progress in this direction.","",""

Using the NNs to compensate the unknown aerodynamic forces online and the robust adaptive mechanism to cancel the combination of the overlarge NNs compensation error and the external disturbances, the new robust neural identifier exhibits a better identification performance in the complex flight environment. Moreover, an optimized algorithm is included in the NNs mechanism to alleviate the burdensome online computation.

A robust unsupervised learning algorithm enables the RQNN to effectively capture the statistical behavior of the input signal and facilitates the estimation of signal embedded in noise with unknown characteristics. The results from a number of benchmark tests show that simple signals such as dc, staircase dc, and sinusoidal signals embedded within high noise can be accurately filtered and particle swarm optimization can be employed to select model parameters. The RQNN filtering procedure is applied in a two-class motor imagery-based brain-computer interface where the objective was to filter electroencephalogram (EEG) signals before feature extraction and classification to increase signal separability. A two-step inner-outer fivefold cross-validation approach is utilized to select the algorithm parameters subject-specifically for nine subjects.

Most of the existing fuzzy neural network (FNN) models have been proposed to implement different types of single-stage fuzzy reasoning mechanisms. Single-stage fuzzy reasoning, however, is only the most basic among a human being's various types of reasoning mechanisms. Syllogistic fuzzy reasoning, where the consequence of a rule in one reasoning stage is passed to the next stage as a fact, is essential to effectively build up a large scale system with high level intelligence. In view of the fact that the fusion of syllogistic fuzzy logic and neural networks has not been sufficiently studied, a new FNN model based on syllogistic fuzzy reasoning, termed cascaded FNN (CFNN), is proposed in this paper. From the stipulated input-output data pairs, the model can generate an appropriate syllogistic fuzzy rule set through structure (genetic) learning and parameter (back-propagation) learning procedures proposed in this paper. In addition, we particularly discuss and analyze the performance of the proposed model in terms of approximation ability and robustness as compared with single-stage FNN models. The effectiveness of the proposed CFNN model is demonstrated through simulating two benchmark problems in fuzzy control and nonlinear function approximation domain.","",""

Especially, there is no relevant finite-time stabilization research for such system, and this paper makes up for the gap. The existence of global solution under the framework of Filippov for such system is guaranteed by limiting discontinuous activation functions. According to set-valued analysis and Kakutani’s fixed point theorem, we obtain the existence of equilibrium point. In particular, based on differential inclusion theory and fractional Lyapunov stability theory, several new sufficient conditions are given to ensure finite-time stabilization via a novel discontinuous controller, and the upper bound of the settling time for stabilization is estimated. In addition, we analyze the finite-time stabilization of FNNs with Lipschitz-continuous activation functions under uncertainty.
