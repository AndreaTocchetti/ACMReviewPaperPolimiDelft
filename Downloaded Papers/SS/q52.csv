We evaluate seven widely used machine-learning methods using a series of two large-scale field experiments. The first field experiment generates a common pool of training data for each of the seven methods. We then validate the seven optimized policies provided by each method together with uniform benchmark policies in a second field experiment. The findings not only compare the performance of the targeting methods, but also demonstrate how well the methods address common data challenges. Our results reveal that when the training data are ideal, model-driven methods perform better than distance-driven methods and classification methods. However, the performance advantage vanishes in the presence of challenges that affect the quality of the training data, including the extent to which the training data captures details of the implementation setting. The challenges we study are covariate shift, concept shift, information loss through aggregation, and imbalanced data. Intuitively, the model-driven methods make better use of the information available in the training data, but the performance of these methods is more sensitive to deterioration in the quality of this information. The classification methods we tested performed relatively poorly. We explain the poor performance of the classification methods in our setting and describe how the performance of these methods could be improved.

I argue that robustness is desirable to the extent that we're concerned about finding real patterns in the world. The import of real patterns differs according to the problem context. In some contexts, non-robust explanations can constitute a moral hazard. By being clear about the extent to which we care about capturing real patterns, we can also determine whether the Rashomon Effect is a boon or a bane.","",""

Towards minimizing discrimination against a group, fair machine learning algorithms strive to equalize the behavior of a model across different groups, by imposing a fairness constraint on models. However, we show that giving the same importance to groups of different sizes and distributions, to counteract the effect of bias in training data, can be in conflict with robustness. We analyze data poisoning attacks against group-based fair machine learning, with the focus on equalized odds. An adversary who can control sampling or labeling for a fraction of training data, can reduce the test accuracy significantly beyond what he can achieve on unconstrained models. Adversarial sampling and adversarial labeling attacks can also worsen the model's fairness gap on test data, even though the model satisfies the fairness constraint on training data. We analyze the robustness of fair machine learning through an empirical evaluation of attacks on multiple algorithms and benchmark datasets.","",""

A practical definition of the robustness R of a model, first used by Szegedy et al. (2013), is the average size of the minimum adversarial perturbation ρ(x) across many samples x, R = 〈ρ(x)〉 x where (1) ρ(x) = min δ d(x,x+ δ) s.t. x+ δ is adversarial (2) and d(·) is some distance measure. Unfortunately, finding the global minimum adversarial perturbation is close to impossible in any practical setting, and we thus employ heuristic attacks to find a suitable approximation. Such heuristics, however, can fail, in which case we could easily be mislead to believe that a model is robust (Brendel & Bethge, 2017). Our best strategy is thus to employ as many attacks as possible, and to use the minimal perturbation found across all attacks as an approximation to the true global minimum. At the moment, however, such a strategy is severely obstructed by two problems: first, the code for most known attack methods is either not available at all, or only available for one particular deep learning framework. Second, implementations of the same attack often differ in many details and are thus not directly comparable. Foolbox improves upon the existing Python package cleverhans by Papernot et al. (2016b) in three important aspects: 1. It interfaces with most popular machine learning frameworks such as PyTorch, Keras, TensorFlow, Theano, Lasagne and MXNet and provides a straight forward way to add support for other frameworks, 2. it provides reference implementations for more than 15 adversarial attacks with a simple and consistent API, and 3. it supports many different criteria for adversarial examples, including custom ones.

Due to de-identification requirements, however, current experimental practices for public EHR benchmarks (such as the MIMIC-III critical care dataset) are time agnostic, assigning care records to train or test sets without regard for the actual dates of care. As a result, current benchmarks cannot assess how well models trained on one year generalise to another. In this work, we obtain a Limited Data Use Agreement to access year of care for each record in MIMIC and show that all tested state-of-the-art models decay in prediction quality when trained on historical data and tested on future data, particularly in response to a system-wide record-keeping change in 2008 (0.29 drop in AUROC for mortality prediction, 0.10 drop in AUROC for length-of-stay prediction with a random forest classifier). We further develop a simple yet effective mitigation strategy: by aggregating raw features into expert-defined clinical concepts, we see only a 0.06 drop in AUROC for mortality prediction and a 0.03 drop in AUROC for length-of-stay prediction. We demonstrate that this aggregation strategy outperforms other automatic feature preprocessing techniques aimed at increasing robustness to data drift.

Specifically, we use a conditional generator that defines the perturbation set over a constrained region of the latent space. We formulate desirable properties that measure the quality of a learned perturbation set, and theoretically prove that a conditional variational autoencoder naturally satisfies these criteria. Using this framework, our approach can generate a variety of perturbations at different complexities and scales, ranging from baseline spatial transformations, through common image corruptions, to lighting variations. We measure the quality of our learned perturbation sets both quantitatively and qualitatively, finding that our models are capable of producing a diverse set of meaningful perturbations beyond the limited data seen during training.

While recent Android malware detectors rely more on semantic features from Dalvik bytecode rather than manifest, existing attacking/defending methods are no longer effective.

In this work, we propose SWIFT, a robust PPML framework for a range of ML algorithms in SOC setting, that guarantees output delivery to the users irrespective of any adversarial behaviour. Robustness, a highly desirable feature, evokes user participation without the fear of denial of service.  At the heart of our framework lies a highly-efficient, maliciously-secure, three-party computation (3PC) over rings that provides guaranteed output delivery (GOD) in the honest-majority setting. To the best of our knowledge, SWIFT is the first robust and efficient PPML framework in the 3PC setting. SWIFT is as fast as the best-known 3PC framework BLAZE (Patra et al.

With the advances in information and sensing technology (sensors and sensor networks), it has become feasible to monitor large/diverse number of parameters in complex real-world structures either continuously or intermittently by employing large in-situ (wireless) sensor networks. The availability of this historical data has engendered a lot of interest in a data-driven approach as a natural and more viable option for realizing the goal of SHM in such structures. However, the lack of sensor data corresponding to different damage scenarios continues to remain a challenge. Most of the supervised machine-learning/deep-learning techniques, when trained using this inherently limited data, lack robustness and generalizability. Physics-informed learning, which involves the integration of domain knowledge into the learning process, is presented here as a potential remedy to this challenge. As a step towards the goal of automated damage detection (mathematically an inverse problem), preliminary results are presented from dynamic modelling of beam structures using physics-informed artificial neural networks. Forward and inverse problems involving partial differential equations are solved and comparisons reveal a clear superiority of physics-informed approach over one that is purely datadriven vis-à-vis overfitting/generalization. Other ways of incorporating domain knowledge into the machine learning pipeline are then presented through case-studies on various aspects of NDI/SHM (visual inspection, impact diagnosis). Lastly, as the final attribute of an optimal SHM approach, a sensing paradigm for non-contact full-field measurements for damage diagnosis is presented.","",""

Nevertheless, the implementation of large datasets generated by high-throughput phenotyping tools such as hyperspectral reflectance in cultivar development programs is still challenging due to the essential need for intensive knowledge in computational and statistical analyses. In this study, the robustness of three common machine learning (ML) algorithms, multilayer perceptron (MLP), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF), were evaluated for predicting soybean (Glycine max) seed yield using hyperspectral reflectance. For this aim, the hyperspectral reflectance data for the whole spectra ranged from 395 to 1005 nm, which were collected at the R4 and R5 growth stages on 250 soybean genotypes grown in four environments. The recursive feature elimination (RFE) approach was performed to reduce the dimensionality of the hyperspectral reflectance data and select variables with the largest importance values. The results indicated that R5 is more informative stage for measuring hyperspectral reflectance to predict seed yields. The 395 nm reflectance band was also identified as the high ranked band in predicting the soybean seed yield. By considering either full or selected variables as the input variables, the ML algorithms were evaluated individually and combined-version using the ensemble–stacking (E–S) method to predict the soybean yield. The RF algorithm had the highest performance with a value of 84% yield classification accuracy among all the individual tested algorithms. Therefore, by selecting RF as the metaClassifier for E–S method, the prediction accuracy increased to 0.93, using all variables, and 0.87, using selected variables showing the success of using E–S as one of the ensemble techniques. This study demonstrated that soybean breeders could implement E–S algorithm using either the full or selected spectra reflectance to select the high-yielding soybean genotypes, among a large number of genotypes, at early growth stages.","",""

Background: Modern causal inference methods allow machine learning to be used to weaken parametric modeling assumptions. However, the use of machine learning may result in complications for inference. Doubly robust cross-fit estimators have been proposed to yield better statistical properties. Methods: We conducted a simulation study to assess the performance of several different estimators for the average causal effect. The data generating mechanisms for the simulated treatment and outcome included log-transforms, polynomial terms, and discontinuities. We compared singly robust estimators (g-computation, inverse probability weighting) and doubly robust estimators (augmented inverse probability weighting, targeted maximum likelihood estimation). We estimated nuisance functions with parametric models and ensemble machine learning separately. We further assessed doubly robust cross-fit estimators. Results: With correctly specified parametric models, all of the estimators were unbiased and confidence intervals achieved nominal coverage. When used with machine learning, the doubly robust cross-fit estimators substantially outperformed all of the other estimators in terms of bias, variance, and confidence interval coverage. Conclusions: Due to the difficulty of properly specifying parametric models in high-dimensional data, doubly robust estimators with ensemble learning and cross-fitting may be the preferred approach for estimation of the average causal effect in most epidemiologic studies. However, these approaches may require larger sample sizes to avoid finite-sample issues.","",""

Traditional machine learning models are no longer robust and reliable when they are under attack. The action and reaction between machine learning systems and the adversary can be modeled as a game between two or more players. Under well‐defined attack models, game theory can provide robustness guarantee for machine learning models that are otherwise vulnerable to application‐time data corruption. We review two cases of game theory‐based machine learning techniques: in one case, players play a zero sum game by following a minimax strategy, while in the other case, players play a sequential game with one player as the leader and the rest as the followers. Experimental results on e‐mail spam and web spam datasets are presented. In the zero sum game, we demonstrate that an adversarial SVM model built upon the minimax strategy is much more resilient to adversarial attacks than standard SVM and one‐class SVM models. We also show that optimal learning strategies derived to counter overly pessimistic attack models can produce unsatisfactory results when the real attacks are much weaker. In the sequential game, we demonstrate that the mixed strategy, allowing a player to randomize over available strategies, is the best solution in general without knowing what types of adversaries machine learning applications are facing in the wild.

Second order algorithms are among the most powerful optimization algorithms with superior convergence properties as compared to first order methods such as SGD and ADAM. The main disadvantage of traditional second order methods is their heavier per-iteration computation and poor accuracy as compared to first order methods. To address these, we incorporate several novel approaches in AdaHessian, including: (i) a new variance reduction estimate of the Hessian diagonal with low computational overhead; (ii) a root-mean-square exponential moving average to smooth out variations of the Hessian diagonal across different iterations; and (iii) a block diagonal averaging to reduce the variance of Hessian diagonal elements. We show that AdaHessian achieves new state-of-the-art results by a large margin as compared to other adaptive optimization methods, including variants of ADAM. In particular, we perform extensive tests on CV, NLP, and recommendation system tasks and find that AdaHessian: (i) achieves 1.80\%/1.45\% higher accuracy on ResNets20/32 on Cifar10, and 5.55\% higher accuracy on ImageNet as compared to ADAM; (ii) outperforms ADAMW for transformers by 0.27/0.33 BLEU score on IWSLT14/WMT14 and 1.8/1.0 PPL on PTB/Wikitext-103; and (iii) achieves 0.032\% better score than AdaGrad for DLRM on the Criteo Ad Kaggle dataset.

In a complex confounding scenario, the simple confounders were transformed to induce complicated nonlinear relationships. In the simple scenario, when ML algorithms were used, double-robust estimators were superior to single-robust estimators. In the complex scenario, single-robust estimators with ML algorithms were at least as biased as estimators using misspecified parametric models. Double-robust estimators were less biased, but coverage was well below nominal.

The main goals of the present study were to objectively identify pathological phenotypes and factors that, in addition to SARS‐CoV‐2, may influence their occurrence. Lungs from 26 patients who died from SARS‐CoV‐2 acute respiratory failure were comprehensively analysed. Robust machine learning techniques were implemented to obtain a global pathological score to distinguish phenotypes with prevalent vascular or alveolar injury. The score was then analysed to assess its possible correlation with clinical, laboratory, radiological, and tissue viral data. Furthermore, an exploratory random forest algorithm was developed to identify the most discriminative clinical characteristics at hospital admission that might predict pathological phenotypes of SARS‐CoV‐2. Vascular injury phenotype was observed in most cases being consistently present as pure form or in combination with alveolar injury. Phenotypes with more severe alveolar injury showed significantly more frequent tracheal intubation; longer invasive mechanical ventilation, illness duration, intensive care unit or hospital ward stay; and lower tissue viral quantity (p < 0.001). Furthermore, in this phenotype, superimposed infections, tumours, and aspiration pneumonia were also more frequent (p < 0.001). Random forest algorithm identified some clinical features at admission (body mass index, white blood cells, D‐dimer, lymphocyte and platelet counts, fever, respiratory rate, and PaCO2) to stratify patients into different clinical clusters and potential pathological phenotypes (a web‐app for score assessment has also been developed; https://r-ubesp.dctv.unipd.it/shiny/AVI-Score/).

Unlike classical RTM parametrization schemes based on ANN, in this method the resulting ANN can be used for arbitrary geometry and layer optical thicknesses. In the second method, the IO is trained by using the real measurements (preprocessed Level-2 TROPOMI data) to improve the stability of the inverse operator.

Therefore, it is necessary to correctly recognize and timely mitigate the PQDs. In this context, an emerging trend is the development of machine learning assisted PQDs management. Based on the conventional processing theory, the existing PQDs identification is time-invariant. It can result in a huge amount of unnecessary information being collected, processed, and transmitted. Consequently, needless processing activities, power consumption and latency can occur. In this paper, a novel combination of signal-piloted acquisition, adaptive-rate segmentation and time-domain features extraction with machine learning tools is suggested. The signal-piloted acquisition and processing brings real-time compression. Therefore, a remarkable reduction can be secured in the data storage, processing and transmission requirement towards the post classifier. Additionally, a reduced computational cost and latency of classifier is promised. The classification is accomplished by using robust machine learning algorithms. A comparison is made among the k-Nearest Neighbor, Naïve Bayes, Artificial Neural Network and Support Vector Machine. Multiple metrics are used to test the success of classification. It permits to avoid any biasness of findings. The applicability of the suggested approach is studied for automated recognition of the power signal’s major voltage and transient disturbances.

Unfortunately, the CAN bus protocol is vulnerable to various cyberattacks due to the lack of a message authentication mechanism in the protocol itself, paving the way for attackers to penetrate the network. This paper proposes a new effective anomaly detection model based on a modified one-class support vector machine in the CAN traffic. The proposed model makes use of an improved algorithm, known as the modified bat algorithm, to find the most accurate structure in the offline training. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, CAN traffic is logged from an unmodified licensed electric vehicle in normal operation to generate a dataset for each message ID and a corresponding occurrence frequency without any attacks. In addition, to measure the performance and superiority of the proposed method compared to the other two famous CAN bus anomaly detection algorithms such as Isolation Forest and classical one-class support vector machine, we provided Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) for each method to quantify the correctly classified windows in the test sets containing attacks. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method achieved the highest rate of True Positive Rate (TPR) and lowest False Positive Rate (FPR) for anomaly detection compared to the other two algorithms. Moreover, in order to show that the proposed method can be applied to other datasets, we used two recent popular public datasets in the scope of CAN bus traffic anomaly detection. Benchmarking with more CAN bus traffic datasets proves the independency of the proposed method from the meaning of each message ID and data field that make the model adaptable with different CAN datasets.","",""

We mined both academic and grey literature and identified 29 engineering best practices for ML applications. We conducted a survey among 313 practitioners to determine the degree of adoption for these practices and to validate their perceived effects. Using the survey responses, we quantified practice adoption, differentiated along demographic characteristics, such as geography or team size. We also tested correlations and investigated linear and non-linear relationships between practices and their perceived effect using various statistical models. Results. Our findings indicate, for example, that larger teams tend to adopt more practices, and that traditional software engineering practices tend to have lower adoption than ML specific practices. Also, the statistical models can accurately predict perceived effects such as agility, software quality and traceability, from the degree of adoption for specific sets of practices. Combining practice adoption rates with practice importance, as revealed by statistical models, we identify practices that are important but have low adoption, as well as practices that are widely adopted but are less important for the effects we studied.

To conquer the noise issue in arrival picking for weak microseismic or earthquake event, I leverage the machine learning techniques to help recognizing seismic waveforms in microseismic or earthquake data. Because of the dependency of supervised machine learning algorithm on large volume of well-designed training data, I utilize an unsupervised machine learning algorithm to help cluster the time samples into two groups, that is, waveform points and non-waveform points. The fuzzy clustering algorithm has been demonstrated to be effective for such purpose. A group of synthetic, real microseismic and earthquake data sets with different levels of complexity show that the proposed method is much more robust than the state-of-the-art STA/LTA method in picking microseismic events, even in the case of moderately strong background noise.","",""

For the present machine-learning-based data reconstruction, we use the downsampled skip-connection/multiscale model based on a convolutional neural network, incorporating the multiscale nature of fluid flows into its network structure. As an initial example, the model is applied to the two-dimensional cylinder wake at $Re_D = 100$. The reconstructed flow fields by the present method show great agreement with the reference data obtained by direct numerical simulation. Next, we apply the current model to a two-dimensional decaying homogeneous isotropic turbulence. The machine-learned model is able to track the decaying evolution from spatial and temporal coarse input data. The proposed concept is further applied to a complex turbulent channel flow over a three-dimensional domain at $Re_{\tau }=180$. The present model reconstructs high-resolved turbulent flows from very coarse input data in space, and also reproduces the temporal evolution for appropriately chosen time interval. The dependence on the number of training snapshots and duration between the first and last frames based on a temporal two-point correlation coefficient are also assessed to reveal the capability and robustness of spatio-temporal super resolution reconstruction. These results suggest that the present method can perform a range of flow reconstructions in support of computational and experimental efforts.","",""

In order to solve the problem of low precision and low efficiency in predicting thermophilic proteins, a prediction method based on feature fusion and machine learning was proposed in this paper.    For the selected thermophilic data sets, firstly, the thermophilic protein sequence was characterized based on feature fusion by the combination of g-gap dipeptide, entropy density and autocorrelation coefficient. Then, Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) was used to reduce the dimension of the expressed protein sequence features in order to reduce the training time and improve efficiency. Finally, the classification model was designed by using the classification algorithm.    A variety of classification algorithms was used to train and test on the selected thermophilic dataset. By comparison, the accuracy of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) under the jackknife method was over 92%. The combination of other evaluation indicators also proved that the SVM performance was the best.     Because of choosing an effectively feature representation method and a robust classifier, the proposed method is suitable for predicting thermophilic proteins and is superior to most reported methods.

Relationship science—an interdisciplinary field spanning psychology, sociology, economics, family studies, and communication—has identified hundreds of variables that purportedly shape romantic relationship quality. The current project used machine learning to directly quantify and compare the predictive power of many such variables among 11,196 romantic couples. People’s own judgments about the relationship itself—such as how satisfied and committed they perceived their partners to be, and how appreciative they felt toward their partners—explained approximately 45% of their current satisfaction. The partner’s judgments did not add information, nor did either person’s personalities or traits. Furthermore, none of these variables could predict whose relationship quality would increase versus decrease over time. Given the powerful implications of relationship quality for health and well-being, a central mission of relationship science is explaining why some romantic relationships thrive more than others. This large-scale project used machine learning (i.e., Random Forests) to 1) quantify the extent to which relationship quality is predictable and 2) identify which constructs reliably predict relationship quality. Across 43 dyadic longitudinal datasets from 29 laboratories, the top relationship-specific predictors of relationship quality were perceived-partner commitment, appreciation, sexual satisfaction, perceived-partner satisfaction, and conflict. The top individual-difference predictors were life satisfaction, negative affect, depression, attachment avoidance, and attachment anxiety. Overall, relationship-specific variables predicted up to 45% of variance at baseline, and up to 18% of variance at the end of each study. Individual differences also performed well (21% and 12%, respectively). Actor-reported variables (i.e., own relationship-specific and individual-difference variables) predicted two to four times more variance than partner-reported variables (i.e., the partner’s ratings on those variables). Importantly, individual differences and partner reports had no predictive effects beyond actor-reported relationship-specific variables alone. These findings imply that the sum of all individual differences and partner experiences exert their influence on relationship quality via a person’s own relationship-specific experiences, and effects due to moderation by individual differences and moderation by partner-reports may be quite small. Finally, relationship-quality change (i.e., increases or decreases in relationship quality over the course of a study) was largely unpredictable from any combination of self-report variables. This collective effort should guide future models of relationships.","",""

When we put multiple PointHop units in cascade, the attributes of a point will grow by taking its relationship with one-hop neighbor points into account iteratively. Furthermore, to control the rapid dimension growth of the attribute vector associated with a point, we use the Saab transform to reduce the attribute dimension in each PointHop unit. In the classification and ensemble stage, we feed the feature vector obtained from multiple PointHop units to a classifier. We explore ensemble methods to improve the classification performance furthermore. It is shown by experimental results that the PointHop method offers classification performance that is comparable with state-of-the-art methods while demanding much lower training complexity.","",""

In this paper, we explore different adversarial scenarios in the context of quantum machine learning. We find that, similar to traditional classifiers based on classical neural networks, quantum learning systems are likewise vulnerable to crafted adversarial examples, independent of whether the input data is classical or quantum. In particular, we find that a quantum classifier that achieves nearly the state-of-the-art accuracy can be conclusively deceived by adversarial examples obtained via adding imperceptible perturbations to the original legitimate samples. This is explicitly demonstrated with quantum adversarial learning in different scenarios, including classifying real-life images (e.g., handwritten digit images in the dataset MNIST), learning phases of matter (such as, ferromagnetic/paramagnetic orders and symmetry protected topological phases), and classifying quantum data. Furthermore, we show that based on the information of the adversarial examples at hand, practical defense strategies can be designed to fight against a number of different attacks. Our results uncover the notable vulnerability of quantum machine learning systems to adversarial perturbations, which not only reveals a novel perspective in bridging machine learning and quantum physics in theory but also provides valuable guidance for practical applications of quantum classifiers based on both near-term and future quantum technologies.","",""

Synthetic data could unlock the potential within health care datasets that are too sensitive for release. Several synthetic data generators have been developed to date; however, studies evaluating their efficacy and generalizability are scarce. Objective This work sets out to understand the difference in performance of supervised machine learning models trained on synthetic data compared with those trained on real data. Methods A total of 19 open health datasets were selected for experimental work. Synthetic data were generated using three synthetic data generators that apply classification and regression trees, parametric, and Bayesian network approaches. Real and synthetic data were used (separately) to train five supervised machine learning models: stochastic gradient descent, decision tree, k-nearest neighbors, random forest, and support vector machine. Models were tested only on real data to determine whether a model developed by training on synthetic data can used to accurately classify new, real examples. The impact of statistical disclosure control on model performance was also assessed. Results A total of 92% of models trained on synthetic data have lower accuracy than those trained on real data. Tree-based models trained on synthetic data have deviations in accuracy from models trained on real data of 0.177 (18%) to 0.193 (19%), while other models have lower deviations of 0.058 (6%) to 0.072 (7%). The winning classifier when trained and tested on real data versus models trained on synthetic data and tested on real data is the same in 26% (5/19) of cases for classification and regression tree and parametric synthetic data and in 21% (4/19) of cases for Bayesian network-generated synthetic data. Tree-based models perform best with real data and are the winning classifier in 95% (18/19) of cases. This is not the case for models trained on synthetic data. When tree-based models are not considered, the winning classifier for real and synthetic data is matched in 74% (14/19), 53% (10/19), and 68% (13/19) of cases for classification and regression tree, parametric, and Bayesian network synthetic data, respectively. Statistical disclosure control methods did not have a notable impact on data utility. Conclusions The results of this study are promising with small decreases in accuracy observed in models trained with synthetic data compared with models trained with real data, where both are tested on real data. Such deviations are expected and manageable. Tree-based classifiers have some sensitivity to synthetic data, and the underlying cause requires further investigation. This study highlights the potential of synthetic data and the need for further evaluation of their robustness. Synthetic data must ensure individual privacy and data utility are preserved in order to instill confidence in health care departments when using such data to inform policy decision-making.","",""

To address this problem, different approaches, manual and automated, have been proposed over the years, including more recently machine learning alternatives. However, despite the advances achieved, some machine learning techniques have not yet been effectively explored, such as the use of feature selection techniques. Moreover, it is not clear to what extent the use of numerous source-code features are necessary for reasonable bad smell detection success. Therefore, in this work we propose an approach using low-cost machine learning for effective and efficient detection of bad smells, through explicit feature selection. Our results showed that the selection allowed to statistically improve the effectiveness of the models. For some cases, the models achieved statistical equivalence, but relying on a highly reduced set of features. Indeed, by using explicit feature selection, simpler models such as Naive Bayes became statistically equivalent to robust models such as Random Forest. Therefore, the selection of features allowed keeping competitive or even superior effectiveness while also improving the efficiency of the models, demanding less computational resources for source-code preprocessing, model training and bad smell detection.","",""

One server holds the model parameters while several workers train the model. Clearly, such architecture is prone to various types of component failures, which can be all encompassed within the spectrum of a Byzantine behavior. Several approaches have been proposed recently to tolerate Byzantine workers. Yet all require trusting a central parameter server. We initiate in this paper the study of the ""general"" Byzantine-resilient distributed machine learning problem where no individual component is trusted. In particular, we distribute the parameter server computation on several nodes. We show that this problem can be solved in an asynchronous system, despite the presence of ⅓ Byzantine parameter servers and ⅓ Byzantine workers (which is optimal). We present a new algorithm, ByzSGD, which solves the general Byzantine-resilient distributed machine learning problem by relying on three major schemes. The first, Scatter/Gather, is a communication scheme whose goal is to bound the maximum drift among models on correct servers. The second, Distributed Median Contraction (DMC), leverages the geometric properties of the median in high dimensional spaces to bring parameters within the correct servers back close to each other, ensuring learning convergence. The third, Minimum-Diameter Averaging (MDA), is a statistically-robust gradient aggregation rule whose goal is to tolerate Byzantine workers. MDA requires loose bound on the variance of non-Byzantine gradient estimates, compared to existing alternatives (e.g., Krum [12]). Interestingly, ByzSGD ensures Byzantine resilience without adding communication rounds (on a normal path), compared to vanilla non-Byzantine alternatives. ByzSGD requires, however, a larger number of messages which, we show, can be reduced if we assume synchrony. We implemented ByzSGD on top of TensorFlow, and we report on our evaluation results. In particular, we show that ByzSGD achieves convergence in Byzantine settings with around 32% overhead compared to vanilla TensorFlow. Furthermore, we show that ByzSGD's throughput overhead is 24--176% in the synchronous case and 28--220% in the asynchronous case.","",""

Defensive distillation is a recently proposed approach that can take an arbitrary neural network, and increase its robustness, reducing the success rate of current attacks' ability to find adversarial examples from 95% to 0.5%.In this paper, we demonstrate that defensive distillation does not significantly increase the robustness of neural networks by introducing three new attack algorithms that are successful on both distilled and undistilled neural networks with 100% probability. Our attacks are tailored to three distance metrics used previously in the literature, and when compared to previous adversarial example generation algorithms, our attacks are often much more effective (and never worse).

We hope our attacks will be used as a benchmark in future defense attempts to create neural networks that resist adversarial examples.","",""

The 5G cellular network promises to provide ultra-high-speed, reduced delay, and reliable communications. The development of new technologies such as the network function virtualization (NFV) and software defined networking (SDN) are critical enabling technologies leveraging 5G. The SDN-based 5G network can provide an excellent platform for autonomous vehicles because SDN offers open programmability and flexibility for new services incorporation. This separation of control and data planes enables centralized and efficient management of resources in a very optimized and secure manner by having a global overview of the whole network. The SDN also provides flexibility in communication administration and resource management, which are of critical importance when considering the ad-hoc nature of vehicular network infrastructures, in terms of safety, privacy, and security, in vehicular network environments. In addition, it promises the overall improved performance. In this paper, we propose a flow-based policy framework on the basis of two tiers virtualization for vehicular networks using SDNs. The vehicle to vehicle (V2V) communication is quite possible with wireless virtualization where different radio resources are allocated to V2V communications based on the flow classification, i.e., safety-related flow or non-safety flows, and the controller is responsible for managing the overall vehicular environment and V2X communications. The motivation behind this study is to implement a machine learning-enabled architecture to cater the sophisticated demands of modern vehicular Internet infrastructures. The inclination towards robust communications in 5G-enabled networks has made it somewhat tricky to manage network slicing efficiently.

However, unlike the active-source seismic events, the microseismic events usually have low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which makes its data processing challenging. To overcome the noise issue of the weak microseismic events, we propose a new workflow for high-resolution microseismic event detection. For the preprocessing, fix-sized segmentation with a length of 2*wavelength is used to divide the data into segments. Later on, 191 features have been extracted and used as the input data to train the support vector machine (SVM) model. These features include 63 1-D time/spectral-domain features, and 128 2-D texture features, which indicate the continuity, smoothness, and irregularity of the events/noise. The proposed feature extraction maximally exploits the limited information of each segment. Afterward, we use a combination of univariate feature selection and random-forest-based recursive feature elimination for feature selection to avoid overfitting. This feature selection strategy not only finds the best features, but also decides the optimal number of features that are needed for the best accuracy. Regarding the training process, SVM with a Gaussian kernel is used. In addition, a cross-validation (CV) process is implemented for automatic parameter setting. In the end, a group of synthetic and field microseismic data with different levels of complexity show that the proposed workflow is much more robust than the state-of-the-art short-term-average over long-term-average ratio (STA/LTA) method and also performs better than the convolutional-neural-networks (CNN), for this case where the amount of training data sets is limited.

Using advanced multi-variate analysis tools and pooled data from case-control imaging studies conducted at 5 sites (941 adult participants, including 440 patients with schizophrenia), a neuroanatomical signature of patients with schizophrenia was found, and its robustness and reproducibility across sites, populations, and scanners, was established for single-patient classification. Analyses were conducted at multiple scales, including regional volumes, voxelwise measures, and complex distributed patterns. Single-subject classification was tested for single-site, pooled-site, and leave-site-out generalizability. Regional and voxelwise analyses revealed a pattern of widespread reduced regional gray matter volume, particularly in the medial prefrontal, temporolimbic and peri-Sylvian cortex, along with ventricular and pallidum enlargement. Multivariate classification using pooled data achieved a cross-validated prediction accuracy of 76% (AUC = 0.84). Critically, the leave-site-out validation of the detected schizophrenia signature showed accuracy/AUC range of 72-77%/0.73-0.91, suggesting a robust generalizability across sites and patient cohorts. Finally, individualized patient classifications displayed significant correlations with clinical measures of negative, but not positive, symptoms.

Our simulations show that K-fold Cross-Validation (CV) produces strongly biased performance estimates with small sample sizes, and the bias is still evident with sample size of 1000. Nested CV and train/test split approaches produce robust and unbiased performance estimates regardless of sample size. We also show that feature selection if performed on pooled training and testing data is contributing to bias considerably more than parameter tuning. In addition, the contribution to bias by data dimensionality, hyper-parameter space and number of CV folds was explored, and validation methods were compared with discriminable data. The results suggest how to design robust testing methodologies when working with small datasets and how to interpret the results of other studies based on what validation method was used.","",""

Nonetheless, the process of tuning catalyst structure to optimize selectivity is still largely empirical. Zahrt et al. present a framework for more efficient, predictive optimization. As a proof of principle, they focused on a known coupling reaction of imines and thiols catalyzed by chiral phosphoric acid compounds. By modeling multiple conformations of more than 800 prospective catalysts, and then training machine-learning algorithms on a subset of experimental results, they achieved highly accurate predictions of enantioselectivities. Science, this issue p. eaau5631 A model encompassing multiple conformations of chiral phosphoric acid catalysts accurately predicts enantioselectivities. INTRODUCTION The development of new synthetic methods in organic chemistry is traditionally accomplished through empirical optimization. Catalyst design, wherein experimentalists attempt to qualitatively identify correlations between catalyst structure and catalyst efficiency, is no exception. However, this approach is plagued by numerous deficiencies, including the lack of mechanistic understanding of a new transformation, the inherent limitations of human cognitive abilities to find patterns in large collections of data, and the lack of quantitative guidelines to aid catalyst identification. Chemoinformatics provides an attractive alternative to empiricism for several reasons: Mechanistic information is not a prerequisite, catalyst structures can be characterized by three-dimensional (3D) descriptors (numerical representations of molecular properties derived from the 3D molecular structure) that quantify the steric and electronic properties of thousands of candidate molecules, and the suitability of a given catalyst candidate can be quantified by comparing its properties with a computationally derived model trained on experimental data. The ability to accurately predict a selective catalyst by using a set of less than optimal data remains a major goal for machine learning with respect to asymmetric catalysis. We report a method to achieve this goal and propose a more efficient alternative to traditional catalyst design. RATIONALE The workflow we have created consists of the following components: (i) construction of an in silico library comprising a large collection of conceivable, synthetically accessible catalysts derived from a particular scaffold; (ii) calculation of relevant chemical descriptors for each scaffold; (iii) selection of a representative subset of the catalysts [this subset is termed the universal training set (UTS) because it is agnostic to reaction or mechanism and thus can be used to optimize any reaction catalyzed by that scaffold]; (iv) collection of the training data; and (v) application of machine learning methods to generate models that predict the enantioselectivity of each member of the in silico library. These models are evaluated with an external test set of catalysts (predicting selectivities of catalysts outside of the training data). The validated models can then be used to select the optimal catalyst for a given reaction. RESULTS To demonstrate the viability of our method, we predicted reaction outcomes with substrate combinations and catalysts different from the training data and simulated a situation in which highly selective reactions had not been achieved. In the first demonstration, a model was constructed by using support vector machines and validated with three different external test sets. The first test set evaluated the ability of the model to predict the selectivity of only reactions forming new products with catalysts from the training set. The model performed well, with a mean absolute deviation (MAD) of 0.161 kcal/mol. Next, the same model was used to predict the selectivity of an external test set of catalysts with substrate combinations from the training set. The performance of the model was still highly accurate, with a MAD of 0.211 kcal/mol. Lastly, reactions forming new products with the external test catalysts were predicted with a MAD of 0.236 kcal/mol. In the second study, no reactions with selectivity above 80% enantiomeric excess were used as training data. Deep feed-forward neural networks accurately reproduced the experimental selectivity data, successfully predicting the most selective reactions. More notably, the general trends in selectivity, on the basis of average catalyst selectivity, were correctly identified. Despite omitting about half of the experimental free energy range from the training data, we could still make accurate predictions in this region of selectivity space. CONCLUSION The capability to predict selective catalysts has the potential to change the way chemists select and optimize chiral catalysts from an empirically guided to a mathematically guided approach. Chemoinformatics-guided optimization protocol. (A) Generation of a large in silico library of catalyst candidates. (B) Calculation of robust chemical descriptors. (C) Selection of a UTS.

R, any group; X, O or S; Y, OH, SH, or NHTf; PC, principal component; ΔΔG, mean selectivity. Catalyst design in asymmetric reaction development has traditionally been driven by empiricism, wherein experimentalists attempt to qualitatively recognize structural patterns to improve selectivity. Machine learning algorithms and chemoinformatics can potentially accelerate this process by recognizing otherwise inscrutable patterns in large datasets. Herein we report a computationally guided workflow for chiral catalyst selection using chemoinformatics at every stage of development. Robust molecular descriptors that are agnostic to the catalyst scaffold allow for selection of a universal training set on the basis of steric and electronic properties. This set can be used to train machine learning methods to make highly accurate predictive models over a broad range of selectivity space. Using support vector machines and deep feed-forward neural networks, we demonstrate accurate predictive modeling in the chiral phosphoric acid–catalyzed thiol addition to N-acylimines.","",""

However, one big limitation of previous research is that the security domain and the privacy domain have typically been considered separately. It is thus unclear whether the defense methods in one domain will have any unexpected impact on the other domain. In this paper, we take a step towards resolving this limitation by combining the two domains. In particular, we measure the success of membership inference attacks against six state-of-the-art defense methods that mitigate the risk of adversarial examples (i.e., evasion attacks). Membership inference attacks determine whether or not an individual data record has been part of a model's training set. The accuracy of such attacks reflects the information leakage of training algorithms about individual members of the training set. Adversarial defense methods against adversarial examples influence the model's decision boundaries such that model predictions remain unchanged for a small area around each input. However, this objective is optimized on training data. Thus, individual data records in the training set have a significant influence on robust models. This makes the models more vulnerable to inference attacks. To perform the membership inference attacks, we leverage the existing inference methods that exploit model predictions. We also propose two new inference methods that exploit structural properties of robust models on adversarially perturbed data. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that compared with the natural training (undefended) approach, adversarial defense methods can indeed increase the target model's risk against membership inference attacks. When using adversarial defenses to train the robust models, the membership inference advantage increases by up to 4.5 times compared to the naturally undefended models. Beyond revealing the privacy risks of adversarial defenses, we further investigate the factors, such as model capacity, that influence the membership information leakage.","",""

The average number of enrolled participants in the studies was 71 (range 8-214), and the average follow-up study duration was 69 days (range 3-180). Of the 8 interventions, 6 (75%) showed statistical significance (at the P=.05 level) in health outcomes. Conclusions This review found that digital health interventions incorporating machine learning algorithms in real-life studies can be useful and effective. Given the low number of studies identified in this review and that they did not follow a rigorous machine learning evaluation methodology, we urge the research community to conduct further studies in intervention settings following evaluation principles and demonstrating the potential of machine learning in clinical practice.","",""

The method is inherently parallelizable and is applicable to problems with non-differentiable loss functions, for which back-propagation is not possible. Applications of our approach include offline and online supervised learning with deep neural networks, as well as graph-based semi-supervised learning. The essence of the EKI procedure is an ensemble based approximate gradient descent in which derivatives are replaced by differences from within the ensemble. We suggest several modifications to the basic method, derived from empirically successful heuristics developed in the context of SGD.

Despite its functional significance, computational methods to accurately identify malonylation sites are still lacking and urgently needed. In particular, there is currently no comprehensive analysis and assessment of different features and machine learning (ML) methods that are required for constructing the necessary prediction models. Here, we review, analyze and compare 11 different feature encoding methods, with the goal of extracting key patterns and characteristics from residue sequences of Kmal sites. We identify optimized feature sets, with which four commonly used ML methods (random forest, support vector machines, K-nearest neighbor and logistic regression) and one recently proposed [Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM)] are trained on data from three species, namely, Escherichia coli, Mus musculus and Homo sapiens, and compared using randomized 10-fold cross-validation tests. We show that integration of the single method-based models through ensemble learning further improves the prediction performance and model robustness on the independent test. When compared to the existing state-of-the-art predictor, MaloPred, the optimal ensemble models were more accurate for all three species (AUC: 0.930, 0.923 and 0.944 for E. coli, M. musculus and H. sapiens, respectively). Using the ensemble models, we developed an accessible online predictor, kmal-sp, available at http://kmalsp.erc.monash.edu/. We hope that this comprehensive survey and the proposed strategy for building more accurate models can serve as a useful guide for inspiring future developments of computational methods for PTM site prediction, expedite the discovery of new malonylation and other PTM types and facilitate hypothesis-driven experimental validation of novel malonylated substrates and malonylation sites.","",""

Most of them prefer to live independently and are susceptible to fall incidents. Falls often lead to serious or even fatal injuries which are the leading cause of death for elderlies. To address this problem, it is essential to develop robust fall detection systems. In this context, we develop a machine learning framework for fall detection and daily living activity recognition. We use acceleration and angular velocity data from two public databases to recognize seven different activities, including falls and activities of daily living. From the acceleration and angular velocity data, we extract time- and frequency-domain features and provide them to a classification algorithm. In this paper, we test the performance of four algorithms for classifying human activities. These algorithms are the artificial neural network (ANN),  $K$ -nearest neighbors (KNN), quadratic support vector machine (QSVM), and ensemble bagged tree (EBT). New features that improve the performance of the classifier are extracted from the power spectral density of the acceleration. In the first step, only the acceleration data are used for activity recognition. Our results reveal that the KNN, ANN, QSVM, and EBT algorithms could achieve overall accuracy of 81.2%, 87.8%, 93.2%, and 94.1%, respectively. The accuracy of fall detection reaches 97.2% and 99.1% without any false alarms for the QSVM and EBT algorithms, respectively. In a second step, we extract features from the autocorrelation function and the power spectral density of both the acceleration and the angular velocity data, which improves the classification accuracy. By using the proposed features, we could achieve overall accuracy of 85.8%, 91.8%, 96.1%, and 97.7% for the KNN, ANN, QSVM, and EBT algorithms, respectively. The accuracy of fall detection reaches 100% for both the QSVM and EBT algorithms without any false alarm, which is the best achievable performance.","",""

In many such cases one currently needs to retreat to transfer-based attacks which rely on cumbersome substitute models, need access to the training data and can be defended against. Here we emphasise the importance of attacks which solely rely on the final model decision. Such decision-based attacks are (1) applicable to real-world black-box models such as autonomous cars, (2) need less knowledge and are easier to apply than transfer-based attacks and (3) are more robust to simple defences than gradient- or score-based attacks. Previous attacks in this category were limited to simple models or simple datasets. Here we introduce the Boundary Attack, a decision-based attack that starts from a large adversarial perturbation and then seeks to reduce the perturbation while staying adversarial. The attack is conceptually simple, requires close to no hyperparameter tuning, does not rely on substitute models and is competitive with the best gradient-based attacks in standard computer vision tasks like ImageNet. We apply the attack on two black-box algorithms from Clarifai.com.

Its accurate evaluation from first principles requires quantum chemistry methods that are often too demanding for routine use. The highly accurate calculations reported herein provide a much-needed benchmark of the accuracy of hybrid density functional theory (DFT) as well as training data for a machine-learning model that can predict the polarizability tensor with an error that is about 50% smaller than DFT. This framework provides an accurate, inexpensive, and transferable strategy for estimating the polarizabilities of molecules containing dozens of atoms, and therefore removes a considerable obstacle to accurate and reliable atomistic-based modeling of matter. The molecular dipole polarizability describes the tendency of a molecule to change its dipole moment in response to an applied electric field. This quantity governs key intra- and intermolecular interactions, such as induction and dispersion; plays a vital role in determining the spectroscopic signatures of molecules; and is an essential ingredient in polarizable force fields. Compared with other ground-state properties, an accurate prediction of the molecular polarizability is considerably more difficult, as this response quantity is quite sensitive to the underlying electronic structure description. In this work, we present highly accurate quantum mechanical calculations of the static dipole polarizability tensors of 7,211 small organic molecules computed using linear response coupled cluster singles and doubles theory (LR-CCSD). Using a symmetry-adapted machine-learning approach, we demonstrate that it is possible to predict the LR-CCSD molecular polarizabilities of these small molecules with an error that is an order of magnitude smaller than that of hybrid density functional theory (DFT) at a negligible computational cost. The resultant model is robust and transferable, yielding molecular polarizabilities for a diverse set of 52 larger molecules (including challenging conjugated systems, carbohydrates, small drugs, amino acids, nucleobases, and hydrocarbon isomers) at an accuracy that exceeds that of hybrid DFT. The atom-centered decomposition implicit in our machine-learning approach offers some insight into the shortcomings of DFT in the prediction of this fundamental quantity of interest.","",""

Thus, the need remains for accurate and validated prediction models for use in preoperative management, informed consent, shared decision-making, and risk adjustment for reimbursement. Questions/purposes The purpose of this study was to use machine learning methods and large national databases to develop and validate (both internally and externally) parsimonious risk-prediction models for mortality and complications after TJA. Methods Preoperative demographic and clinical variables from all 107,792 nonemergent primary THAs and TKAs in the 2013 to 2014 American College of Surgeons-National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) were evaluated as predictors of 30-day death and major complications. The NSQIP database was chosen for its high-quality data on important outcomes and rich characterization of preoperative demographic and clinical predictors for demographically and geographically diverse patients. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, a type of machine learning that optimizes accuracy and parsimony, was used for model development. Tenfold validation was used to produce C-statistics, a measure of how well models discriminate patients who experience an outcome from those who do not. External validation, which evaluates the generalizability of the models to new data sources and patient groups, was accomplished using data from the Veterans Affairs Surgical Quality Improvement Program (VASQIP). Models previously developed from VASQIP data were also externally validated using NSQIP data to examine the generalizability of their performance with a different group of patients outside the VASQIP context. Results The models, developed using LASSO regression with diverse clinical (for example, American Society of Anesthesiologists classification, comorbidities) and demographic (for example, age, gender) inputs, had good accuracy in terms of discriminating the likelihood a patient would experience, within 30 days of arthroplasty, a renal complication (C-statistic, 0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.76-0.80), death (0.73; 95% CI, 0.70-0.76), or a cardiac complication (0.73; 95% CI, 0.71-0.75) from one who would not. By contrast, the models demonstrated poor accuracy for venous thromboembolism (C-statistic, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.60-0.62) and any complication (C-statistic, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.63-0.65). External validation of the NSQIP- derived models using VASQIP data found them to be robust in terms of predictions about mortality and cardiac complications, but not for predicting renal complications. Models previously developed with VASQIP data had poor accuracy when externally validated with NSQIP data, suggesting they should not be used outside the context of the Veterans Health Administration. Conclusions Moderately accurate predictive models of 30-day mortality and cardiac complications after elective primary TJA were developed as well as internally and externally validated. To our knowledge, these are the most accurate and rigorously validated TJA-specific prediction models currently available (http://med.stanford.edu/s-spire/Resources/clinical-tools-.html). Methods to improve these models, including the addition of nonstandard inputs such as natural language processing of preoperative clinical progress notes or radiographs, should be pursued as should the development and validation of models to predict longer term improvements in pain and function.

In both linear and nonlinear settings, kernels that incorporate information on dynamic systems, such as the smoothness and stability of the input–output map, can challenge consolidated approaches based on parametric model structures. In the classical parametric setting, the complexity of the model (the model order) needs to be chosen, typically from a finite family of alternatives, by trading bias and variance. This (discrete) model order selection step may be critical, especially when the true model does not belong to the model class.

Stormwater discharge into water bodies significantly contributes to environmental pollution. The choice of suitable treatment technologies is dependent on the pollutant concentrations. Wastewater quality indicators such as biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total suspended solids (TSS), and total dissolved solids (TDS) give a measure of the main pollutants. The aim of this study is to provide an indirect methodology for the estimation of the main wastewater quality indicators, based on some characteristics of the drainage basin. The catchment is seen as a black box: the physical processes of accumulation, washing, and transport of pollutants are not mathematically described. Two models deriving from studies on artificial intelligence have been used in this research: Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Regression Trees (RT). Both the models showed robustness, reliability, and high generalization capability. However, with reference to coefficient of determination R2 and root‐mean square error, Support Vector Regression showed a better performance than Regression Tree in predicting TSS, TDS, and COD. As regards BOD5, the two models showed a comparable performance. Therefore, the considered machine learning algorithms may be useful for providing an estimation of the values to be considered for the sizing of the treatment units in absence of direct measures.","",""

Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization seeks data-driven decisions that perform well under the most adverse distribution within a certain Wasserstein distance from a nominal distribution constructed from the training samples.

This setup arises in many practical applications, including Google's Federated Learning. Formally, we focus on a decentralized system that consists of a parameter server and m working machines; each working machine keeps N/m data samples, where N is the total number of samples. In each iteration, up to q of the m working machines suffer Byzantine faults -- a faulty machine in the given iteration behaves arbitrarily badly against the system and has complete knowledge of the system. Additionally, the sets of faulty machines may be different across iterations. Our goal is to design robust algorithms such that the system can learn the underlying true parameter, which is of dimension d, despite the interruption of the Byzantine attacks. In this paper, based on the geometric median of means of the gradients, we propose a simple variant of the classical gradient descent method. We show that our method can tolerate q Byzantine failures up to 2(1+ε)q łe m for an arbitrarily small but fixed constant ε>0. The parameter estimate converges in O(łog N) rounds with an estimation error on the order of max √dq/N, ~√d/N , which is larger than the minimax-optimal error rate √d/N in the centralized and failure-free setting by at most a factor of √q . The total computational complexity of our algorithm is of O((Nd/m) log N) at each working machine and O(md + kd log 3 N) at the central server, and the total communication cost is of O(m d log N). We further provide an application of our general results to the linear regression problem. A key challenge arises in the above problem is that Byzantine failures create arbitrary and unspecified dependency among the iterations and the aggregated gradients. To handle this issue in the analysis, we prove that the aggregated gradient, as a function of model parameter, converges uniformly to the true gradient function.","",""

The proposed method utilizes the already-existing asymmetric RF communication framework and does not require any additional circuitry for PUF generation or feature extraction. The burden of device identification is completely shifted to the gateway Rx, similar to the operation of a human listener’s brain.

Mobility prediction of vehicles can address the aforementioned challenge, since it can provide a better routing planning and improve overall VANET performance in terms of continuous service availability. In this paper, a centralized routing scheme with mobility prediction is proposed for VANET assisted by an artificial intelligence powered software-defined network (SDN) controller. Specifically, the SDN controller can perform accurate mobility prediction through an advanced artificial neural network technique. Then, based on the mobility prediction, the successful transmission probability and average delay of each vehicle's request under frequent network topology changes can be estimated by the roadside units (RSUs) or the base station (BS). The estimation is performed based on a stochastic urban traffic model in which the vehicle arrival follows a non-homogeneous Poisson process. The SDN controller gathers network information from RSUs and BS that are considered as the switches. Based on the global network information, the SDN controller computes optimal routing paths for switches (i.e., BS and RSU). While the source vehicle and destination vehicle are located in the coverage area of the same switch, further routing decision will be made by the RSUs or the BS independently to minimize the overall vehicular service delay. The RSUs or the BS schedule the requests of vehicles by either vehicle-to-vehicle or vehicle-to-infrastructure communication, from the source vehicle to the destination vehicle. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed centralized routing scheme outperforms others in terms of transmission delay, and the transmission performance of our proposed routing scheme is more robust with varying vehicle velocity.","",""

A naive Bayes approach, which is based on Markov models generated separately for UAV and non-UAV classes, is used to check for the presence of a UAV in each frame. In the classification phase, unlike the traditional approaches that rely solely on time-domain signals and corresponding features, the proposed technique uses the energy transient signal. This approach is more robust to noise and can cope with different modulation techniques. First, the normalized energy trajectory is generated from the energy-time-frequency distribution of the raw control signal. Next, the start and end points of the energy transient are detected by searching for the most abrupt changes in the mean of the energy trajectory. Then, a set of statistical features is extracted from the energy transient. Significant features are selected by performing neighborhood component analysis (NCA)to keep the computational cost of the algorithm low. Finally, selected features are fed to several machine learning algorithms for classification. The algorithms are evaluated experimentally using a database containing 100 RF signals from each of 14 different UAV controllers. The signals are recorded wirelessly using a high-frequency oscilloscope. The data set is randomly partitioned into training and test sets for validation with the ratio 4:1.

The models are developed using a number of test results on 50-mm mortar cubes containing glass powder according to ASTM C109. Parametric and sensitivity analyses are conducted to evaluate the effect of the predictor variables on the compressive strength. Furthermore, a comparative study is performed to benchmark the proposed models against classical regression models.FindingsThe derived design equations accurately characterize the compressive strength of concrete with ground glass fillers and remarkably outperform the regression models. A key feature of the proposed models as compared to the previous studies is that they include the simultaneous effect of various parameters such as glass compositions, size distributions, curing age and isothermal temperatures. Parametric and sensitivity analyses indicate that compressive strength is very sensitive to the curing age, curing temperature and particle surface area.Originality/valueThis study presents accurate machine learning models for the prediction of one of the most important mechanical properties of cementitious mixtures modified by waste glass, i.e. compressive strength. In addition, it provides an insight into the effect of several parameters influencing the compressive strength.

A wearable, sensor-based system is suitable for such ends, as it will be able to monitor the dogs in real-time. However, the question remains unanswered as to what kind of data should be used to detect the activity patterns and emotional patterns, as does another: what should be the location of the sensors for the collection of data and how should we automate the system? Yet these questions remain unanswered, because to date, there is no such system that can address the above-mentioned concerns. The main purpose of this study was (1) to develop a system that can detect the activities and emotions based on the accelerometer and gyroscope signals and (2) to automate the system with robust machine learning techniques for implementing it for real-time situations. Therefore, we propose a system which is based on the data collected from 10 dogs, including nine breeds of various sizes and ages, and both genders. We used machine learning classification techniques for automating the detection and evaluation process. The ground truth fetched for the evaluation process was carried out by taking video recording data in frame per second and the wearable sensors data were collected in parallel with the video recordings. Evaluation of the system was performed using an ANN (artificial neural network), random forest, SVM (support vector machine), KNN (k nearest neighbors), and a naïve Bayes classifier. The robustness of our system was evaluated by taking independent training and validation sets. We achieved an accuracy of 96.58% while detecting the activity and 92.87% while detecting emotional behavior, respectively. This system will help the owners of dogs to track their behavior and emotions in real-life situations for various breeds in different scenarios.","",""

Knowing the size and location of the places that positively or negatively recovered is important to effectively support policymakers to help readjust planning and resource allocation to rebuild better. Disasters and the subsequent recovery are mainly expressed through unique land cover and land use changes (LCLUCs). Although LCLUCs have been widely studied in remote sensing, their value for recovery assessment has not yet been explored, which is the focus of this paper. An RS-based methodology was created for PDR assessment based on multi-temporal, very high-resolution satellite images. Different trajectories of change were analyzed and evaluated, i.e., transition patterns (TPs) that signal positive or negative recovery. Experimental analysis was carried out on three WorldView-2 images acquired over Tacloban city, Philippines, which was heavily affected by Typhoon Haiyan in 2013. Support vector machine, a robust machine learning algorithm, was employed with texture features extracted from the grey level co-occurrence matrix and local binary patterns. Although classification results for the images before and four years after the typhoon show high accuracy, substantial uncertainties mark the results for the immediate post-event image. All land cover (LC) and land use (LU) classified maps were stacked, and only changes related to TPs were extracted. The final products are LC and LU recovery maps that quantify the PDR process at the pixel level. It was found that physical and functional recovery can be mainly explained through the LCLUC information. In addition, LC and LU-based recovery maps support a general and a detailed recovery understanding, respectively. It is therefore suggested to use the LC and LU-based recovery maps to monitor and support the short and the long-term recovery, respectively.","",""

The 3D model is biologically similar to developing neural structures, but its complexity necessitates extensive expertise and effort to employ. By instead focusing solely on constructing an assay of developmental neurotoxicity, we propose that a simpler 2D tissue model may prove sufficient. We thus compare the accuracy of predictive models trained on data from a 2D tissue model with those trained on data from a 3D tissue model, and find the 2D model to be substantially more accurate. Furthermore, we find the 2D model to be more robust under stringent gene set selection, whereas the 3D model suffers substantial accuracy degradation.

In this paper, supervised learning (classification) algorithms are applied for a supplier assessment problem where a model is trained based on the previous historical data and then tested on the new unseen data set. This method will provide an efficient way for supplier assessment that is more effective in terms of accuracy and time when compared to MCDM approach.

However, there still remains a practical issue to be approached when applying the ELM: the randomly generated hidden node parameters without tuning can lead to the hidden node outputs being nonuniformly distributed, thus giving rise to poor generalization performance. To address this deficiency, a novel activation function with an affine transformation (AT) on its input is introduced into the ELM, which leads to an improved ELM algorithm that is referred to as an AT-ELM in this paper. The scaling and translation parameters of the AT activation function are computed based on the maximum entropy principle in such a way that the hidden layer outputs approximately obey a uniform distribution. Application of the AT-ELM algorithm in nonlinear function regression shows its robustness to the range scaling of the network inputs. Experiments on nonlinear function regression, real-world data set classification, and benchmark image recognition demonstrate better performance for the AT-ELM compared with the original ELM, the regularized ELM, and the kernel ELM. Recognition results on benchmark image data sets also reveal that the AT-ELM outperforms several other state-of-the-art algorithms in general.","",""

Low-cost sensing strategies hold the promise of denser air quality monitoring networks, which could significantly improve our understanding of personal air pollution exposure. Additionally, low-cost air quality sensors could be deployed to areas where limited monitoring exists. However, low-cost sensors are frequently sensitive to environmental conditions and pollutant cross-sensitivities, which have historically been poorly addressed by laboratory calibrations, limiting their utility for monitoring. In this study, we investigated different calibration models for the Real-time Affordable Multi-Pollutant (RAMP) sensor package, which measures CO, NO2, O3, and CO2. We explored three methods: (1) laboratory univariate linear regression, (2) empirical multiple linear regression, and (3) machine-learning-based calibration models using random forests (RF). Calibration models were developed for 16–19 RAMP monitors (varied by pollutant) using training and testing windows spanning August 2016 through February 2017 in Pittsburgh, PA, US. The random forest models matched (CO) or significantly outperformed (NO2, CO2, O3) the other calibration models, and their accuracy and precision were robust over time for testing windows of up to 16 weeks. Following calibration, average mean absolute error on the testing data set from the random forest models was 38 ppb for CO (14 % relative error), 10 ppm for CO2 (2 % relative error), 3.5 ppb for NO2 (29 % relative error), and 3.4 ppb for O3 (15 % relative error), and Pearson r versus the reference monitors exceeded 0.8 for most units. Model performance is explored in detail, including a quantification of model variable importance, accuracy across different concentration ranges, and performance in a range of monitoring contexts including the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and the US EPA Air Sensors Guidebook recommendations of minimum data quality for personal exposure measurement. A key strength of the RF approach is that it accounts for pollutant cross-sensitivities. This highlights the importance of developing multipollutant sensor packages (as opposed to single-pollutant monitors); we determined this is especially critical for NO2 and CO2. The evaluation reveals that only the RF-calibrated sensors meet the US EPA Air Sensors Guidebook recommendations of minimum data quality for personal exposure measurement. We also demonstrate that the RF-model-calibrated sensors could detect differences in NO2 concentrations between a near-road site and a suburban site less than 1.5 km away. From this study, we conclude that combining RF models with carefully controlled state-of-the-art multipollutant sensor packages as in the RAMP monitors appears to be a very promising approach to address the poor performance that has plagued low-cost air quality sensors.","",""

First, we introduce performance-based regularization PBR, where the idea is to constrain the sample variances of the estimated portfolio risk and return, which steers the solution toward one associated with less estimation error in the performance. We consider PBR for both mean-variance and mean-conditional value-at-risk CVaR problems. For the mean-variance problem, PBR introduces a quartic polynomial constraint, for which we make two convex approximations: one based on rank-1 approximation and another based on a convex quadratic approximation. The rank-1 approximation PBR adds a bias to the optimal allocation, and the convex quadratic approximation PBR shrinks the sample covariance matrix. For the mean-CVaR problem, the PBR model is a combinatorial optimization problem, but we prove its convex relaxation, a quadratically constrained quadratic program, is essentially tight. We show that the PBR models can be cast as robust optimization problems with novel uncertainty sets and establish asymptotic optimality of both sample average approximation SAA and PBR solutions and the corresponding efficient frontiers. To calibrate the right-hand sides of the PBR constraints, we develop new, performance-based k-fold cross-validation algorithms. Using these algorithms, we carry out an extensive empirical investigation of PBR against SAA, as well as L1 and L2 regularizations and the equally weighted portfolio.

Despite being diagnosed with ASD, some individuals exhibit outstanding scholastic, non-academic, and artistic capabilities, in such cases posing a challenging task for scientists to provide answers. In the last few years, ASD has been investigated by social and computational intelligence scientists utilizing advanced technologies such as machine learning to improve diagnostic timing, precision, and quality. Machine learning is a multidisciplinary research topic that employs intelligent techniques to discover useful concealed patterns, which are utilized in prediction to improve decision making. Machine learning techniques such as support vector machines, decision trees, logistic regressions, and others, have been applied to datasets related to autism in order to construct predictive models. These models claim to enhance the ability of clinicians to provide robust diagnoses and prognoses of ASD. However, studies concerning the use of machine learning in ASD diagnosis and treatment suffer from conceptual, implementation, and data issues such as the way diagnostic codes are used, the type of feature selection employed, the evaluation measures chosen, and class imbalances in data among others. A more serious claim in recent studies is the development of a new method for ASD diagnoses based on machine learning. This article critically analyses these recent investigative studies on autism, not only articulating the aforementioned issues in these studies but also recommending paths forward that enhance machine learning use in ASD with respect to conceptualization, implementation, and data. Future studies concerning machine learning in autism research are greatly benefitted by such proposals.","",""

In particular, the input weights for constructing feature maps are randomly generated and hence need not be trained or tuned, which makes the algorithm highly efficient. Moreover, the maximum pooling operation enables the algorithm to be invariant to certain transformations. During the ELM learning stage, elastic-net regularization is proposed to learn the output weight. Elastic-net regularization helps to learn more compact and meaningful output weight.
