All rights reserved. ISSN 0738-4602 SPRING 2021 47 Our goal, in this short overview article, is to begin mapping the landscape of methods for accountability of artificial intelligence (AI) systems. For our purposes, we shall define accountability as being able to ascertain whether an AI system is behaving as promised, which is necessary for determining blame-worthiness. In the context of a self-driving car, AI system accountability could be a question of safety; in the context of credit scoring, AI system accountability could be a question of fairness. In an algorithmic trading system, the AI system accountability could be a question of performance and robustness to certain shocks. In this overview, we will not focus on any particular objective (such as safety, fairness, or robustness); we believe that defining and refining these objectives for each context is a moral decision that must be made by the public and their representatives, not technologists. Rather, our goal is to begin the process of mapping the categories of methods that one could use to assess whether an AI system is meeting its objectives. Artificial intelligence systems have provided us with many everyday conveniences. We can easily search for information across millions of webpages via text and voice. Paperwork processing is increasingly automated. Artificial intelligence systems flag potentially fraudulent credit-card transactions and filter our e-mail. Yet these artificial intelligence systems have also experienced significant failings. Across a range of applications, including loan approvals, disease severity scores, hiring algorithms, and face recognition, artificial-intelligence–based scoring systems have exhibited gender and racial bias. Self-driving cars have had serious accidents. As these systems become more prevalent, it is increasingly important that we identify the best ways to keep them accountable.

This includes greater transparency about data, and accountability for decisions made when developing it. In this paper, we introduce a rigorous framework for dataset development transparency that supports decision-making and accountability. The framework uses the cyclical, infrastructural and engineering nature of dataset development to draw on best practices from the software development lifecycle. Each stage of the data development lifecycle yields documents that facilitate improved communication and decision-making, as well as drawing attention to the value and necessity of careful data work. The proposed framework makes visible the often overlooked work and decisions that go into dataset creation, a critical step in closing the accountability gap in artificial intelligence and a critical/necessary resource aligned with recent work on auditing processes.","",""

We then validate the seven optimized policies provided by each method together with uniform benchmark policies in a second field experiment. The findings not only compare the performance of the targeting methods, but also demonstrate how well the methods address common data challenges. Our results reveal that when the training data are ideal, model-driven methods perform better than distance-driven methods and classification methods. However, the performance advantage vanishes in the presence of challenges that affect the quality of the training data, including the extent to which the training data captures details of the implementation setting. The challenges we study are covariate shift, concept shift, information loss through aggregation, and imbalanced data. Intuitively, the model-driven methods make better use of the information available in the training data, but the performance of these methods is more sensitive to deterioration in the quality of this information. The classification methods we tested performed relatively poorly.

In this scenario, the lack of actionable accountability-related guidance is potentially the single most important challenge facing the machine learning community. Machine learning systems are often composed of many parts and ingredients, mixing third party components or software-as-a-service APIs, among others. In this paper we study the role of copies for risk mitigation in such machine learning systems. Formally, a copy can be regarded as an approximated projection operator of a model into a target model hypothesis set. Under the conceptual framework of actionable accountability, we explore the use of copies as a viable alternative in circumstances where models cannot be re-trained, nor enhanced by means of a wrapper.

A practical definition of the robustness R of a model, first used by Szegedy et al. (2013), is the average size of the minimum adversarial perturbation ρ(x) across many samples x, R = 〈ρ(x)〉 x where (1) ρ(x) = min δ d(x,x+ δ) s.t. x+ δ is adversarial (2) and d(·) is some distance measure. Unfortunately, finding the global minimum adversarial perturbation is close to impossible in any practical setting, and we thus employ heuristic attacks to find a suitable approximation. Such heuristics, however, can fail, in which case we could easily be mislead to believe that a model is robust (Brendel & Bethge, 2017). Our best strategy is thus to employ as many attacks as possible, and to use the minimal perturbation found across all attacks as an approximation to the true global minimum. At the moment, however, such a strategy is severely obstructed by two problems: first, the code for most known attack methods is either not available at all, or only available for one particular deep learning framework. Second, implementations of the same attack often differ in many details and are thus not directly comparable. Foolbox improves upon the existing Python package cleverhans by Papernot et al. (2016b) in three important aspects: 1. It interfaces with most popular machine learning frameworks such as PyTorch, Keras, TensorFlow, Theano, Lasagne and MXNet and provides a straight forward way to add support for other frameworks, 2. it provides reference implementations for more than 15 adversarial attacks with a simple and consistent API, and 3. it supports many different criteria for adversarial examples, including custom ones.

However, good accountability in the implementation and use of automated decision-making systems is far from simple. It involves multiple overlapping institutional, technical, and political considerations, and becomes all the more complex in the context of machine learning based, rather than rule based, decision systems. This chapter argues that relying on human oversight of automated systems, so called ‘human-in-the-loop’ approaches, is entirely deficient, and suggests addressing transparency and accountability during the procurement phase of machine learning systems - during their specification and parameterisation - is absolutely critical. In a machine learning based automated decision system, the accountability typically associated with a public official making a decision has already been displaced into the actions and decisions of those creating the system - the bureaucrats and engineers involved in building the relevant models, curating the datasets, and implementing a system institutionally. But what should those system designers be thinking about and asking for when specifying those systems?    There are a lot of accountability mechanisms available for system designers to consider, including new computational transparency mechanisms, ‘fairness’ and non-discrimination, and ‘explainability’ of decisions. If an official specifies for a system to be transparent, fair, or explainable, however, it is important that they understand the limitations of such a specification in the context of machine learning. Each of these approaches is fraught with risks, limitations, and the challenging political economy of technology platforms in government. Without understand the complexities and limitations of those accountability and transparency ideas, they risk disempowering public officials in the face of private industry technology vendors, who use trade secrets and market power in deeply problematic ways, as well as producing deficient accountability outcomes. This chapter therefore outlines the risks associated with corporate cooption of those transparency and accountability mechanisms, and suggests that significant resources must be invested in developing the necessary skills in the public sector for deciding whether a machine learning system is useful and desirable, and how it might be made as accountable and transparent as possible.","",""

To this end, we propose a method of applying optimal perturbations onto Android APK that can successfully deceive the machine learning detectors. We develop an automated tool to generate the adversarial examples without human intervention. In contrast to existing works, the adversarial examples crafted by our method can also deceive recent machine learning-based detectors that rely on semantic features such as control-flow-graph. The perturbations can also be implemented directly onto APK’s Dalvik bytecode rather than Android manifest to evade from recent detectors. We demonstrate our attack on two state-of-the-art Android malware detection schemes, MaMaDroid and Drebin. Our results show that the malware detection rates decreased from 96% to 0% in MaMaDroid, and from 97% to 0% in Drebin, with just a small number of codes to be inserted into the APK.","",""

In the SOC paradigm, computation is outsourced to a set of powerful and specially equipped servers that provide service on a pay-per-use basis. In this work, we propose SWIFT, a robust PPML framework for a range of ML algorithms in SOC setting, that guarantees output delivery to the users irrespective of any adversarial behaviour. Robustness, a highly desirable feature, evokes user participation without the fear of denial of service.  At the heart of our framework lies a highly-efficient, maliciously-secure, three-party computation (3PC) over rings that provides guaranteed output delivery (GOD) in the honest-majority setting. To the best of our knowledge, SWIFT is the first robust and efficient PPML framework in the 3PC setting. SWIFT is as fast as the best-known 3PC framework BLAZE (Patra et al. NDSS'20) which only achieves fairness. Fairness ensures either all or none receive the output, whereas GOD ensures guaranteed output delivery no matter what. We extend our 3PC framework for four parties (4PC). In this regime, SWIFT is as fast as the best known fair 4PC framework Trident (Chaudhari et al.

In this study, the robustness of three common machine learning (ML) algorithms, multilayer perceptron (MLP), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF), were evaluated for predicting soybean (Glycine max) seed yield using hyperspectral reflectance. For this aim, the hyperspectral reflectance data for the whole spectra ranged from 395 to 1005 nm, which were collected at the R4 and R5 growth stages on 250 soybean genotypes grown in four environments. The recursive feature elimination (RFE) approach was performed to reduce the dimensionality of the hyperspectral reflectance data and select variables with the largest importance values. The results indicated that R5 is more informative stage for measuring hyperspectral reflectance to predict seed yields. The 395 nm reflectance band was also identified as the high ranked band in predicting the soybean seed yield. By considering either full or selected variables as the input variables, the ML algorithms were evaluated individually and combined-version using the ensemble–stacking (E–S) method to predict the soybean yield. The RF algorithm had the highest performance with a value of 84% yield classification accuracy among all the individual tested algorithms. Therefore, by selecting RF as the metaClassifier for E–S method, the prediction accuracy increased to 0.93, using all variables, and 0.87, using selected variables showing the success of using E–S as one of the ensemble techniques. This study demonstrated that soybean breeders could implement E–S algorithm using either the full or selected spectra reflectance to select the high-yielding soybean genotypes, among a large number of genotypes, at early growth stages.","",""

The availability of this historical data has engendered a lot of interest in a data-driven approach as a natural and more viable option for realizing the goal of SHM in such structures.

As a step towards the goal of automated damage detection (mathematically an inverse problem), preliminary results are presented from dynamic modelling of beam structures using physics-informed artificial neural networks. Forward and inverse problems involving partial differential equations are solved and comparisons reveal a clear superiority of physics-informed approach over one that is purely datadriven vis-à-vis overfitting/generalization. Other ways of incorporating domain knowledge into the machine learning pipeline are then presented through case-studies on various aspects of NDI/SHM (visual inspection, impact diagnosis).

It is here posited that a synthesis of domain knowledge and machine learning methods allows for the creation of robust toolsets against which newly proposed developments can be benchmarked in a more rigorous manner in the interest of greater accountability and better-evidenced decision-making. A worked example develops a sequence of machine learning models that distinguishing ‘artificial’ towns from their more walkable and mixed-use ‘historical’ equivalents. The dataset is developed from network centrality, mixed-use, land-use accessibility, and population density measures as proxies for spatial complexity, which are computed at the pedestrian-scale for 931 towns and cities in Great Britain. Using officially designated ‘New Towns’ as a departure point, a series of clues is then developed. First, using an iterative human-in-the-loop procedure, a supervised classifier (Extra-Trees) is cultivated from which 185 ‘artificial’ locations are identified based on data aggregated to respective town or city boundaries. This information is then used to train supervised and semi-supervised (M2) deep neural network classifiers against the higher resolution dataset. The models broadly align with intuitions expressed by urbanists and show potential for continued development to broach ensuing challenges pertaining to: selection of curated training exemplars; further development of techniques to accentuate localised scales of analysis; and methods for the calibration of model probabilities to align with the intuitions of domain experts.","",""

The action and reaction between machine learning systems and the adversary can be modeled as a game between two or more players. Under well‐defined attack models, game theory can provide robustness guarantee for machine learning models that are otherwise vulnerable to application‐time data corruption. We review two cases of game theory‐based machine learning techniques: in one case, players play a zero sum game by following a minimax strategy, while in the other case, players play a sequential game with one player as the leader and the rest as the followers. Experimental results on e‐mail spam and web spam datasets are presented. In the zero sum game, we demonstrate that an adversarial SVM model built upon the minimax strategy is much more resilient to adversarial attacks than standard SVM and one‐class SVM models. We also show that optimal learning strategies derived to counter overly pessimistic attack models can produce unsatisfactory results when the real attacks are much weaker. In the sequential game, we demonstrate that the mixed strategy, allowing a player to randomize over available strategies, is the best solution in general without knowing what types of adversaries machine learning applications are facing in the wild. We also discuss scenarios where players' behavior may derail rational decision making and models that consider such decision risks.","",""

Explainability is often discussed as a technical challenge in designing ML systems and decision procedures, to improve understanding of what is typically a “black box” phenomenon. But some of the most difficult challenges are nontechnical and raise questions about the broader accountability of organizations using ML in their decision-making. One reason for this is that many decisions by ML systems may exhibit bias, as systemic biases in society lead to biases in data used by the systems (2). But there is another reason, less widely appreciated. Because the quantities that ML systems seek to optimize have to be specified by their users, explainable ML will force policy-makers to be more explicit about their objectives, and thus about their values and political choices, exposing policy trade-offs that may have previously only been implicit and obscured. As the use of ML in policy spreads, there may have to be public debate that makes explicit the value judgments or weights to be used.

We survey systematic approaches to incorporating physics and domain knowledge into ML models and distill these approaches into broad categories. Through 10 case studies, we show how these approaches have been used successfully for emulating, downscaling, and forecasting weather and climate processes. The accomplishments of these studies include greater physical consistency, reduced training time, improved data efficiency, and better generalization.

We demonstrate the performance of ML-based single- and double-robust estimators. We use 100 Monte Carlo samples with sample sizes of 200, 1200, and 5000 to investigate bias and confidence interval coverage under several scenarios. In a simple confounding scenario, confounders were related to the treatment and the outcome via parametric models. In a complex confounding scenario, the simple confounders were transformed to induce complicated nonlinear relationships. In the simple scenario, when ML algorithms were used, double-robust estimators were superior to single-robust estimators. In the complex scenario, single-robust estimators with ML algorithms were at least as biased as estimators using misspecified parametric models. Double-robust estimators were less biased, but coverage was well below nominal. The use of sample splitting, inclusion of confounder interactions, reliance on a richly specified ML algorithm, and use of doubly robust estimators was the only explored approach that yielded negligible bias and nominal coverage.

The severity and distribution of morphological lesions associated with SARS‐CoV‐2 and how they relate to clinical, laboratory, and radiological data have not yet been studied systematically. The main goals of the present study were to objectively identify pathological phenotypes and factors that, in addition to SARS‐CoV‐2, may influence their occurrence. Lungs from 26 patients who died from SARS‐CoV‐2 acute respiratory failure were comprehensively analysed. Robust machine learning techniques were implemented to obtain a global pathological score to distinguish phenotypes with prevalent vascular or alveolar injury. The score was then analysed to assess its possible correlation with clinical, laboratory, radiological, and tissue viral data. Furthermore, an exploratory random forest algorithm was developed to identify the most discriminative clinical characteristics at hospital admission that might predict pathological phenotypes of SARS‐CoV‐2. Vascular injury phenotype was observed in most cases being consistently present as pure form or in combination with alveolar injury. Phenotypes with more severe alveolar injury showed significantly more frequent tracheal intubation; longer invasive mechanical ventilation, illness duration, intensive care unit or hospital ward stay; and lower tissue viral quantity (p < 0.001). Furthermore, in this phenotype, superimposed infections, tumours, and aspiration pneumonia were also more frequent (p < 0.001). Random forest algorithm identified some clinical features at admission (body mass index, white blood cells, D‐dimer, lymphocyte and platelet counts, fever, respiratory rate, and PaCO2) to stratify patients into different clinical clusters and potential pathological phenotypes (a web‐app for score assessment has also been developed; https://r-ubesp.dctv.unipd.it/shiny/AVI-Score/). In SARS‐CoV‐2 positive patients, alveolar injury is often associated with other factors in addition to viral infection.

Unlike classical RTM parametrization schemes based on ANN, in this method the resulting ANN can be used for arbitrary geometry and layer optical thicknesses. In the second method, the IO is trained by using the real measurements (preprocessed Level-2 TROPOMI data) to improve the stability of the inverse operator.

Simplicity, robustness, and suitability for real-time systems are the salient features of CAN bus. Unfortunately, the CAN bus protocol is vulnerable to various cyberattacks due to the lack of a message authentication mechanism in the protocol itself, paving the way for attackers to penetrate the network. This paper proposes a new effective anomaly detection model based on a modified one-class support vector machine in the CAN traffic. The proposed model makes use of an improved algorithm, known as the modified bat algorithm, to find the most accurate structure in the offline training. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, CAN traffic is logged from an unmodified licensed electric vehicle in normal operation to generate a dataset for each message ID and a corresponding occurrence frequency without any attacks. In addition, to measure the performance and superiority of the proposed method compared to the other two famous CAN bus anomaly detection algorithms such as Isolation Forest and classical one-class support vector machine, we provided Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) for each method to quantify the correctly classified windows in the test sets containing attacks. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method achieved the highest rate of True Positive Rate (TPR) and lowest False Positive Rate (FPR) for anomaly detection compared to the other two algorithms. Moreover, in order to show that the proposed method can be applied to other datasets, we used two recent popular public datasets in the scope of CAN bus traffic anomaly detection. Benchmarking with more CAN bus traffic datasets proves the independency of the proposed method from the meaning of each message ID and data field that make the model adaptable with different CAN datasets.","",""

Consequently, needless processing activities, power consumption and latency can occur. In this paper, a novel combination of signal-piloted acquisition, adaptive-rate segmentation and time-domain features extraction with machine learning tools is suggested.

Non-ML experts can, and should, review ML models. We provide a ‘toolbox’ of questions about three elements of a decision model that can be fruitfully scrutinized by non-ML experts: the learning data, the learning goal, and constructivism. Showing this room for fruitful criticism can empower non-ML experts and improve democratic accountability when using ML models in policing.","",""

In this paper, we provide a mathematical formulation of how this bias can arise. We do so by assuming the existence of underlying, unknown, and unbiased labels which are overwritten by an agent who intends to provide accurate labels but may have biases against certain groups. Despite the fact that we only observe the biased labels, we are able to show that the bias may nevertheless be corrected by re-weighting the data points without changing the labels. We show, with theoretical guarantees, that training on the re-weighted dataset corresponds to training on the unobserved but unbiased labels, thus leading to an unbiased machine learning classifier. Our procedure is fast and robust and can be used with virtually any learning algorithm. We evaluate on a number of standard machine learning fairness datasets and a variety of fairness notions, finding that our method outperforms standard approaches in achieving fair classification.","",""

These issues are particularly acute in highly non-convex settings such as those arising in neural networks. Motivated by this, there has been recent interest in second-order methods that aim to alleviate these shortcomings by capturing curvature information. In this paper, we report detailed empirical evaluations of a class of Newton-type methods, namely sub-sampled variants of trust region (TR) and adaptive regularization with cubics (ARC) algorithms, for non-convex ML problems. In doing so, we demonstrate that these methods not only can be computationally competitive with hand-tuned SGD with momentum, obtaining comparable or better generalization performance, but also they are highly robust to hyper-parameter settings. Further, in contrast to SGD with momentum, we show that the manner in which these Newton-type methods employ curvature information allows them to seamlessly escape flat regions and saddle points.","",""

The increasing reliance on applications with machine learning (ML) components calls for mature engineering techniques that ensure these are built in a robust and future-proof manner. Aim. We aim to empirically determine the state of the art in how teams develop, deploy and maintain software with ML components. Method. We mined both academic and grey literature and identified 29 engineering best practices for ML applications. We conducted a survey among 313 practitioners to determine the degree of adoption for these practices and to validate their perceived effects. Using the survey responses, we quantified practice adoption, differentiated along demographic characteristics, such as geography or team size. We also tested correlations and investigated linear and non-linear relationships between practices and their perceived effect using various statistical models. Results. Our findings indicate, for example, that larger teams tend to adopt more practices, and that traditional software engineering practices tend to have lower adoption than ML specific practices. Also, the statistical models can accurately predict perceived effects such as agility, software quality and traceability, from the degree of adoption for specific sets of practices. Combining practice adoption rates with practice importance, as revealed by statistical models, we identify practices that are important but have low adoption, as well as practices that are widely adopted but are less important for the effects we studied.

Methods: We assemble a retrospective dataset involving 1,487 cases of mammograms in which 644 cases have confirmed malignant mass lesions and 843 have benign lesions. A CAD scheme is first applied to segment mass regions and initially compute 181 features. Then, support vector machine (SVM) models embedded with several feature dimensionality reduction methods are built to predict likelihood of lesions being malignant. All SVM models are trained and tested using a leave-one-case-out cross-validation method. SVM generates a likelihood score of each segmented mass region depicting on one-view mammogram. By fusion of two scores of the same mass depicting on two-view mammograms, a case-based likelihood score is also evaluated. Results: Comparing with the principle component analyses, nonnegative matrix factorization, and Chi-squared methods, SVM embedded with RPA yielded a significantly higher case-based lesion classification performance with the area under ROC curve of 0.84 ± 0.01 (p<0.02).

To conquer the noise issue in arrival picking for weak microseismic or earthquake event, I leverage the machine learning techniques to help recognizing seismic waveforms in microseismic or earthquake data. Because of the dependency of supervised machine learning algorithm on large volume of well-designed training data, I utilize an unsupervised machine learning algorithm to help cluster the time samples into two groups, that is, waveform points and non-waveform points. The fuzzy clustering algorithm has been demonstrated to be effective for such purpose.

For the present machine-learning-based data reconstruction, we use the downsampled skip-connection/multiscale model based on a convolutional neural network, incorporating the multiscale nature of fluid flows into its network structure. As an initial example, the model is applied to the two-dimensional cylinder wake at $Re_D = 100$. The reconstructed flow fields by the present method show great agreement with the reference data obtained by direct numerical simulation. Next, we apply the current model to a two-dimensional decaying homogeneous isotropic turbulence. The machine-learned model is able to track the decaying evolution from spatial and temporal coarse input data. The proposed concept is further applied to a complex turbulent channel flow over a three-dimensional domain at $Re_{\tau }=180$. The present model reconstructs high-resolved turbulent flows from very coarse input data in space, and also reproduces the temporal evolution for appropriately chosen time interval. The dependence on the number of training snapshots and duration between the first and last frames based on a temporal two-point correlation coefficient are also assessed to reveal the capability and robustness of spatio-temporal super resolution reconstruction. These results suggest that the present method can perform a range of flow reconstructions in support of computational and experimental efforts.","",""

When we put multiple PointHop units in cascade, the attributes of a point will grow by taking its relationship with one-hop neighbor points into account iteratively.

We find that, similar to traditional classifiers based on classical neural networks, quantum learning systems are likewise vulnerable to crafted adversarial examples, independent of whether the input data is classical or quantum. In particular, we find that a quantum classifier that achieves nearly the state-of-the-art accuracy can be conclusively deceived by adversarial examples obtained via adding imperceptible perturbations to the original legitimate samples. This is explicitly demonstrated with quantum adversarial learning in different scenarios, including classifying real-life images (e.g., handwritten digit images in the dataset MNIST), learning phases of matter (such as, ferromagnetic/paramagnetic orders and symmetry protected topological phases), and classifying quantum data. Furthermore, we show that based on the information of the adversarial examples at hand, practical defense strategies can be designed to fight against a number of different attacks.

The binary classification process, such as malignant or benign is relatively trivial; whereas, the multimodal brain tumors classification (T1, T2, T1CE, and Flair) is a challenging task for radiologists. Here, we present an automated multimodal classification method using deep learning for brain tumor type classification. The proposed method consists of five core steps. In the first step, the linear contrast stretching is employed using edge-based histogram equalization and discrete cosine transform (DCT). In the second step, deep learning feature extraction is performed. By utilizing transfer learning, two pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) models, namely VGG16 and VGG19, were used for feature extraction. In the third step, a correntropy-based joint learning approach was implemented along with the extreme learning machine (ELM) for the selection of best features. In the fourth step, the partial least square (PLS)-based robust covariant features were fused in one matrix. The combined matrix was fed to ELM for final classification. The proposed method was validated on the BraTS datasets and an accuracy of 97.8%, 96.9%, 92.5% for BraTs2015, BraTs2017, and BraTs2018, respectively, was achieved.","",""

Using advanced multi-variate analysis tools and pooled data from case-control imaging studies conducted at 5 sites (941 adult participants, including 440 patients with schizophrenia), a neuroanatomical signature of patients with schizophrenia was found, and its robustness and reproducibility across sites, populations, and scanners, was established for single-patient classification.

Single-subject classification was tested for single-site, pooled-site, and leave-site-out generalizability.

Multivariate classification using pooled data achieved a cross-validated prediction accuracy of 76% (AUC = 0.84).

One server holds the model parameters while several workers train the model. Clearly, such architecture is prone to various types of component failures, which can be all encompassed within the spectrum of a Byzantine behavior. Several approaches have been proposed recently to tolerate Byzantine workers. Yet all require trusting a central parameter server. We initiate in this paper the study of the ""general"" Byzantine-resilient distributed machine learning problem where no individual component is trusted. In particular, we distribute the parameter server computation on several nodes. We show that this problem can be solved in an asynchronous system, despite the presence of ⅓ Byzantine parameter servers and ⅓ Byzantine workers (which is optimal). We present a new algorithm, ByzSGD, which solves the general Byzantine-resilient distributed machine learning problem by relying on three major schemes. The first, Scatter/Gather, is a communication scheme whose goal is to bound the maximum drift among models on correct servers. The second, Distributed Median Contraction (DMC), leverages the geometric properties of the median in high dimensional spaces to bring parameters within the correct servers back close to each other, ensuring learning convergence. The third, Minimum-Diameter Averaging (MDA), is a statistically-robust gradient aggregation rule whose goal is to tolerate Byzantine workers. MDA requires loose bound on the variance of non-Byzantine gradient estimates, compared to existing alternatives (e.g., Krum [12]). Interestingly, ByzSGD ensures Byzantine resilience without adding communication rounds (on a normal path), compared to vanilla non-Byzantine alternatives. ByzSGD requires, however, a larger number of messages which, we show, can be reduced if we assume synchrony. We implemented ByzSGD on top of TensorFlow, and we report on our evaluation results. In particular, we show that ByzSGD achieves convergence in Byzantine settings with around 32% overhead compared to vanilla TensorFlow. Furthermore, we show that ByzSGD's throughput overhead is 24--176% in the synchronous case and 28--220% in the asynchronous case.","",""

For legal, institutional or commercial reasons, organisations might not hold the data on sensitive attributes such as gender, ethnicity, sexuality or disability needed to diagnose and mitigate emergent indirect discrimination-by-proxy, such as redlining. Such organisations might also lack the knowledge and capacity to identify and manage fairness issues that are emergent properties of complex sociotechnical systems.

We offer a framework that assists these groups in mitigating unfair representations stemming from the training datasets. Our framework relies on two inter-operating adversaries to improve fairness. First, a model is trained with the goal of preventing the guessing of protected attributes' values while limiting utility losses. This first step optimizes the model's parameters for fairness. Second, the framework leverages evasion attacks from adversarial machine learning to generate new examples that will be misclassified. These new examples are then used to retrain and improve the model in the first step. These two steps are iteratively applied until a significant improvement in fairness is obtained. We evaluated our framework on well-studied datasets in the fairness literature -- including COMPAS -- where it can surpass other approaches concerning demographic parity, equality of opportunity and also the model's utility.

Our review of studies which have applied ML to predict autistic from non-autistic individuals showed that small sample size is associated with higher reported classification accuracy.

In addition, the contribution to bias by data dimensionality, hyper-parameter space and number of CV folds was explored, and validation methods were compared with discriminable data.

By modeling multiple conformations of more than 800 prospective catalysts, and then training machine-learning algorithms on a subset of experimental results, they achieved highly accurate predictions of enantioselectivities. Science, this issue p. eaau5631 A model encompassing multiple conformations of chiral phosphoric acid catalysts accurately predicts enantioselectivities. INTRODUCTION The development of new synthetic methods in organic chemistry is traditionally accomplished through empirical optimization. Catalyst design, wherein experimentalists attempt to qualitatively identify correlations between catalyst structure and catalyst efficiency, is no exception. However, this approach is plagued by numerous deficiencies, including the lack of mechanistic understanding of a new transformation, the inherent limitations of human cognitive abilities to find patterns in large collections of data, and the lack of quantitative guidelines to aid catalyst identification. Chemoinformatics provides an attractive alternative to empiricism for several reasons: Mechanistic information is not a prerequisite, catalyst structures can be characterized by three-dimensional (3D) descriptors (numerical representations of molecular properties derived from the 3D molecular structure) that quantify the steric and electronic properties of thousands of candidate molecules, and the suitability of a given catalyst candidate can be quantified by comparing its properties with a computationally derived model trained on experimental data. The ability to accurately predict a selective catalyst by using a set of less than optimal data remains a major goal for machine learning with respect to asymmetric catalysis. We report a method to achieve this goal and propose a more efficient alternative to traditional catalyst design. RATIONALE The workflow we have created consists of the following components: (i) construction of an in silico library comprising a large collection of conceivable, synthetically accessible catalysts derived from a particular scaffold; (ii) calculation of relevant chemical descriptors for each scaffold; (iii) selection of a representative subset of the catalysts [this subset is termed the universal training set (UTS) because it is agnostic to reaction or mechanism and thus can be used to optimize any reaction catalyzed by that scaffold]; (iv) collection of the training data; and (v) application of machine learning methods to generate models that predict the enantioselectivity of each member of the in silico library. These models are evaluated with an external test set of catalysts (predicting selectivities of catalysts outside of the training data). The validated models can then be used to select the optimal catalyst for a given reaction. RESULTS To demonstrate the viability of our method, we predicted reaction outcomes with substrate combinations and catalysts different from the training data and simulated a situation in which highly selective reactions had not been achieved. In the first demonstration, a model was constructed by using support vector machines and validated with three different external test sets. The first test set evaluated the ability of the model to predict the selectivity of only reactions forming new products with catalysts from the training set. The model performed well, with a mean absolute deviation (MAD) of 0.161 kcal/mol. Next, the same model was used to predict the selectivity of an external test set of catalysts with substrate combinations from the training set. The performance of the model was still highly accurate, with a MAD of 0.211 kcal/mol. Lastly, reactions forming new products with the external test catalysts were predicted with a MAD of 0.236 kcal/mol. In the second study, no reactions with selectivity above 80% enantiomeric excess were used as training data. Deep feed-forward neural networks accurately reproduced the experimental selectivity data, successfully predicting the most selective reactions. More notably, the general trends in selectivity, on the basis of average catalyst selectivity, were correctly identified. Despite omitting about half of the experimental free energy range from the training data, we could still make accurate predictions in this region of selectivity space. CONCLUSION The capability to predict selective catalysts has the potential to change the way chemists select and optimize chiral catalysts from an empirically guided to a mathematically guided approach.

R, any group; X, O or S; Y, OH, SH, or NHTf; PC, principal component; ΔΔG, mean selectivity. Catalyst design in asymmetric reaction development has traditionally been driven by empiricism, wherein experimentalists attempt to qualitatively recognize structural patterns to improve selectivity. Machine learning algorithms and chemoinformatics can potentially accelerate this process by recognizing otherwise inscrutable patterns in large datasets. Herein we report a computationally guided workflow for chiral catalyst selection using chemoinformatics at every stage of development. Robust molecular descriptors that are agnostic to the catalyst scaffold allow for selection of a universal training set on the basis of steric and electronic properties. This set can be used to train machine learning methods to make highly accurate predictive models over a broad range of selectivity space. Using support vector machines and deep feed-forward neural networks, we demonstrate accurate predictive modeling in the chiral phosphoric acid–catalyzed thiol addition to N-acylimines.","",""

However, one big limitation of previous research is that the security domain and the privacy domain have typically been considered separately. It is thus unclear whether the defense methods in one domain will have any unexpected impact on the other domain. In this paper, we take a step towards resolving this limitation by combining the two domains. In particular, we measure the success of membership inference attacks against six state-of-the-art defense methods that mitigate the risk of adversarial examples (i.e., evasion attacks). Membership inference attacks determine whether or not an individual data record has been part of a model's training set. The accuracy of such attacks reflects the information leakage of training algorithms about individual members of the training set. Adversarial defense methods against adversarial examples influence the model's decision boundaries such that model predictions remain unchanged for a small area around each input. However, this objective is optimized on training data. Thus, individual data records in the training set have a significant influence on robust models. This makes the models more vulnerable to inference attacks. To perform the membership inference attacks, we leverage the existing inference methods that exploit model predictions. We also propose two new inference methods that exploit structural properties of robust models on adversarially perturbed data. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that compared with the natural training (undefended) approach, adversarial defense methods can indeed increase the target model's risk against membership inference attacks. When using adversarial defenses to train the robust models, the membership inference advantage increases by up to 4.5 times compared to the naturally undefended models. Beyond revealing the privacy risks of adversarial defenses, we further investigate the factors, such as model capacity, that influence the membership information leakage.","",""

This approach is based on the classification without labels (CWoLa) method where the invariant mass is used to create two potentially mixed samples, one with little or no signal and one with a potential resonance. Additional features that are uncorrelated with the invariant mass can be used for training the classifier. Given the lack of new physics signals at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), such model-agnostic approaches are critical for ensuring full coverage to fully exploit the rich datasets from the LHC experiments. In addition to illustrating how the new method works in simple test cases, we demonstrate the power of the extended bump hunt on a realistic all-hadronic resonance search in a channel that would not be covered with existing techniques.","",""

Generally, concrete cracks are visually monitored by inspectors who record crack information such as the existence, location, and width. Manual visual inspection is often considered ineffective in terms of cost, safety, assessment accuracy, and reliability. Digital image processing has been introduced to more accurately obtain crack information from images. A critical challenge is to automatically identify cracks from an image containing actual cracks and crack-like noise patterns (e.g. dark shadows, stains, lumps, and holes), which are often seen in concrete structures. This article presents a methodology for identifying concrete cracks using machine learning. The method helps in determining the existence and location of cracks from surface images. The proposed approach is particularly designed for classifying cracks and noncrack noise patterns that are otherwise difficult to distinguish using existing image processing algorithms. In the training stage of the proposed approach, image binarization is used to extract crack candidate regions; subsequently, classification models are constructed based on speeded-up robust features and convolutional neural network. The obtained crack identification methods are quantitatively and qualitatively compared using new concrete surface images containing cracks and noncracks.","",""

These interventions have the potential to revolutionize health care and lead to substantial outcomes for patients and medical professionals. Objective Our objective was to review the literature on applications of machine learning in real-life digital health interventions, aiming to improve the understanding of researchers, clinicians, engineers, and policy makers in developing robust and impactful data-driven interventions in the health care domain. Methods We searched the PubMed and Scopus bibliographic databases with terms related to machine learning, to identify real-life studies of digital health interventions incorporating machine learning algorithms. We grouped those interventions according to their target (ie, target condition), study design, number of enrolled participants, follow-up duration, primary outcome and whether this had been statistically significant, machine learning algorithms used in the intervention, and outcome of the algorithms (eg, prediction). Results Our literature search identified 8 interventions incorporating machine learning in a real-life research setting, of which 3 (37%) were evaluated in a randomized controlled trial and 5 (63%) in a pilot or experimental single-group study. The interventions targeted depression prediction and management, speech recognition for people with speech disabilities, self-efficacy for weight loss, detection of changes in biopsychosocial condition of patients with multiple morbidity, stress management, treatment of phantom limb pain, smoking cessation, and personalized nutrition based on glycemic response. The average number of enrolled participants in the studies was 71 (range 8-214), and the average follow-up study duration was 69 days (range 3-180). Of the 8 interventions, 6 (75%) showed statistical significance (at the P=.05 level) in health outcomes. Conclusions This review found that digital health interventions incorporating machine learning algorithms in real-life studies can be useful and effective. Given the low number of studies identified in this review and that they did not follow a rigorous machine learning evaluation methodology, we urge the research community to conduct further studies in intervention settings following evaluation principles and demonstrating the potential of machine learning in clinical practice.","",""

To address this problem, it is essential to develop robust fall detection systems. In this context, we develop a machine learning framework for fall detection and daily living activity recognition. We use acceleration and angular velocity data from two public databases to recognize seven different activities, including falls and activities of daily living. From the acceleration and angular velocity data, we extract time- and frequency-domain features and provide them to a classification algorithm. In this paper, we test the performance of four algorithms for classifying human activities. These algorithms are the artificial neural network (ANN),  $K$ -nearest neighbors (KNN), quadratic support vector machine (QSVM), and ensemble bagged tree (EBT). New features that improve the performance of the classifier are extracted from the power spectral density of the acceleration. In the first step, only the acceleration data are used for activity recognition. Our results reveal that the KNN, ANN, QSVM, and EBT algorithms could achieve overall accuracy of 81.2%, 87.8%, 93.2%, and 94.1%, respectively. The accuracy of fall detection reaches 97.2% and 99.1% without any false alarms for the QSVM and EBT algorithms, respectively. In a second step, we extract features from the autocorrelation function and the power spectral density of both the acceleration and the angular velocity data, which improves the classification accuracy. By using the proposed features, we could achieve overall accuracy of 85.8%, 91.8%, 96.1%, and 97.7% for the KNN, ANN, QSVM, and EBT algorithms, respectively.

Recently, these techniques have also gained popularity in the system identification community. In both linear and nonlinear settings, kernels that incorporate information on dynamic systems, such as the smoothness and stability of the input–output map, can challenge consolidated approaches based on parametric model structures. In the classical parametric setting, the complexity of the model (the model order) needs to be chosen, typically from a finite family of alternatives, by trading bias and variance. This (discrete) model order selection step may be critical, especially when the true model does not belong to the model class. In regularization-based approaches, model complexity is controlled by tuning (continuous) regularization parameters, making the model selection step more robust.

In many such cases one currently needs to retreat to transfer-based attacks which rely on cumbersome substitute models, need access to the training data and can be defended against. Here we emphasise the importance of attacks which solely rely on the final model decision. Such decision-based attacks are (1) applicable to real-world black-box models such as autonomous cars, (2) need less knowledge and are easier to apply than transfer-based attacks and (3) are more robust to simple defences than gradient- or score-based attacks. Previous attacks in this category were limited to simple models or simple datasets. Here we introduce the Boundary Attack, a decision-based attack that starts from a large adversarial perturbation and then seeks to reduce the perturbation while staying adversarial. The attack is conceptually simple, requires close to no hyperparameter tuning, does not rely on substitute models and is competitive with the best gradient-based attacks in standard computer vision tasks like ImageNet. We apply the attack on two black-box algorithms from Clarifai.com.

This setup arises in many practical applications, including Google's Federated Learning. Formally, we focus on a decentralized system that consists of a parameter server and m working machines; each working machine keeps N/m data samples, where N is the total number of samples. In each iteration, up to q of the m working machines suffer Byzantine faults -- a faulty machine in the given iteration behaves arbitrarily badly against the system and has complete knowledge of the system. Additionally, the sets of faulty machines may be different across iterations. Our goal is to design robust algorithms such that the system can learn the underlying true parameter, which is of dimension d, despite the interruption of the Byzantine attacks. In this paper, based on the geometric median of means of the gradients, we propose a simple variant of the classical gradient descent method. We show that our method can tolerate q Byzantine failures up to 2(1+ε)q łe m for an arbitrarily small but fixed constant ε>0. The parameter estimate converges in O(łog N) rounds with an estimation error on the order of max √dq/N, ~√d/N , which is larger than the minimax-optimal error rate √d/N in the centralized and failure-free setting by at most a factor of √q . The total computational complexity of our algorithm is of O((Nd/m) log N) at each working machine and O(md + kd log 3 N) at the central server, and the total communication cost is of O(m d log N).

Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization seeks data-driven decisions that perform well under the most adverse distribution within a certain Wasserstein distance from a nominal distribution constructed from the training samples.

These systems frequently displace discretion previously exercised by policymakers or individual front-end government employees with an opaque logic that bears no resemblance to the reasoning processes of agency personnel. However, because agencies acquire these systems through government procurement processes, they and the public have little input into—or even knowledge about—their design or how well that design aligns with public goals and values.    This Article explains the ways that the decisions about goals, values, risk, and certainty, along with the elimination of case-by-case discretion, inherent in machine-learning system design create policies—not just once when they are designed, but over time as they adapt and change. When the adoption of these systems is governed by procurement, the policies they embed receive little or no agency or outside expertise beyond that provided by the vendor. Design decisions are left to private third-party developers. There is no public participation, no reasoned deliberation, and no factual record, which abdicates Government responsibility for policymaking.    This Article then argues for a move from a procurement mindset to policymaking mindset. When policy decisions are made through system design, processes suitable for substantive administrative determinations should be used: processes that foster deliberation reflecting both technocratic demands for reason and rationality informed by expertise, and democratic demands for public participation and political accountability. Specifically, the Article proposes administrative law as the framework to guide the adoption of machine learning governance, describing specific ways that the policy choices embedded in machine-learning system design fail the prohibition against arbitrary and capricious agency actions absent a reasoned decision-making process that both enlists the expertise necessary for reasoned deliberation about, and justification for, such choices, and makes visible the political choices being made.    Finally, this Article sketches models for machine-learning adoption processes that satisfy the prohibition against arbitrary and capricious agency actions. It explores processes by which agencies might garner technical expertise and overcome problems of system opacity, satisfying administrative law’s technocratic demand for reasoned expert deliberation. It further proposes both institutional and engineering design solutions to the challenge of policymaking opacity, offering process paradigms to ensure the “political visibility” required for public input and political oversight. In doing so, it also proposes the importance of using “contestable design”—design that exposes value-laden features and parameters and provides for iterative human involvement in system evolution and deployment. Together, these institutional and design approaches further both administrative law’s technocratic and democratic mandates.","",""

Mobility prediction of vehicles can address the aforementioned challenge, since it can provide a better routing planning and improve overall VANET performance in terms of continuous service availability. In this paper, a centralized routing scheme with mobility prediction is proposed for VANET assisted by an artificial intelligence powered software-defined network (SDN) controller. Specifically, the SDN controller can perform accurate mobility prediction through an advanced artificial neural network technique. Then, based on the mobility prediction, the successful transmission probability and average delay of each vehicle's request under frequent network topology changes can be estimated by the roadside units (RSUs) or the base station (BS). The estimation is performed based on a stochastic urban traffic model in which the vehicle arrival follows a non-homogeneous Poisson process. The SDN controller gathers network information from RSUs and BS that are considered as the switches. Based on the global network information, the SDN controller computes optimal routing paths for switches (i.e., BS and RSU). While the source vehicle and destination vehicle are located in the coverage area of the same switch, further routing decision will be made by the RSUs or the BS independently to minimize the overall vehicular service delay. The RSUs or the BS schedule the requests of vehicles by either vehicle-to-vehicle or vehicle-to-infrastructure communication, from the source vehicle to the destination vehicle. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed centralized routing scheme outperforms others in terms of transmission delay, and the transmission performance of our proposed routing scheme is more robust with varying vehicle velocity.","",""

A naive Bayes approach, which is based on Markov models generated separately for UAV and non-UAV classes, is used to check for the presence of a UAV in each frame. In the classification phase, unlike the traditional approaches that rely solely on time-domain signals and corresponding features, the proposed technique uses the energy transient signal. This approach is more robust to noise and can cope with different modulation techniques. First, the normalized energy trajectory is generated from the energy-time-frequency distribution of the raw control signal. Next, the start and end points of the energy transient are detected by searching for the most abrupt changes in the mean of the energy trajectory. Then, a set of statistical features is extracted from the energy transient. Significant features are selected by performing neighborhood component analysis (NCA)to keep the computational cost of the algorithm low. Finally, selected features are fed to several machine learning algorithms for classification. The algorithms are evaluated experimentally using a database containing 100 RF signals from each of 14 different UAV controllers. The signals are recorded wirelessly using a high-frequency oscilloscope. The data set is randomly partitioned into training and test sets for validation with the ratio 4:1.

Complying with requirements to notify the consumer as to the purpose of data collection is difficult where, as in machine learning, the purpose may not be known at time of notification. Consent is difficult to obtain when the complexity of big data and machine learning systems is beyond the consumer’s comprehension. The notion of data minimization (collecting and storing only data necessary for the purpose for which it was collected, storing it for the minimum period of time) runs counter to the modus operandi of the industry, which emphasizes maximizing the volumes of data collection over time.    The successful functioning of machine learning models and the accuracy of their outputs depends on the quality of the input data. Data protection and privacy laws increasingly impose legal responsibility on firms to ensure the accuracy of the data they hold and process. However, they do not legislate for accuracy of output from big data and machine learning systems. This raises questions about the regulatory responsibilities of those handling big data, concerning both the accuracy of input data in automated decisions and the data reported in formal credit data reporting systems. In some jurisdictions, this has given rise, among other remedies, to certain rights to object to automated decisions.    Inferences from input data generated by machine learning models determine how individuals are viewed and evaluated for automated decisions. Data protection and privacy laws may be insufficient to deal with the outputs of machine learning models that process such data. One of their concerns is to prevent discrimination, typically protecting special categories of groups (e.g., race, ethnicity, religion, gender). In the era of big data, however, non-sensitive data can be used to infer sensitive data.    Machine learning may lead to discriminatory results where the algorithms’ training relies on historical examples that reflect past discrimination, or the model fails to consider a wide enough set of factors. Addressing bias is challenging, but tests have been developed to assess where it may arise. In some countries, where bias is unintentional, it may nevertheless be unlawful if it has “disparate impact,” which arises where the outcomes from a selection process are widely different for a protected class of persons.    The challenges arising for the treatment of big data and machine learning under legal and regulatory frameworks for data protection and privacy suggest that the development of robust self-regulatory and ethical regimes in the artificial intelligence and financial services community may be particularly important. Facing legal and regulatory uncertainty, businesses may introduce risk management systems, employ privacy by design and develop ethics.    Further exploration and development is needed in relation to standards and procedures, including acceptable inferential analytics, reliability of inferences, ethical standards for artificial intelligence, provision of post-decision counterfactuals, documentation of written policies, privacy principles for design, explanations of automated decisions, access to human intervention, and other accountability mechanisms.","",""

Supplier assessment is a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach that requires several criteria for the proper assessment of the suppliers. When there are several criteria involved, it makes the supplier assessment process more complicated. For a comprehensive and robust assessment process, we propose the use of supervised machine learning algorithms to classify various suppliers into four categories: excellent, good, satisfactory, and unsatisfactory. In this paper, supervised learning (classification) algorithms are applied for a supplier assessment problem where a model is trained based on the previous historical data and then tested on the new unseen data set. This method will provide an efficient way for supplier assessment that is more effective in terms of accuracy and time when compared to MCDM approach. Classification algorithms such as support vector machines (with linear, polynomial and radial basis kernels), logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, and naïve Bayes methods are used to train the model and their performance is assessed against a test data. Finally, the performance measures from all the classification methods are used to assess the best supplier.","",""

Low-cost sensing strategies hold the promise of denser air quality monitoring networks, which could significantly improve our understanding of personal air pollution exposure. Additionally, low-cost air quality sensors could be deployed to areas where limited monitoring exists. However, low-cost sensors are frequently sensitive to environmental conditions and pollutant cross-sensitivities, which have historically been poorly addressed by laboratory calibrations, limiting their utility for monitoring. In this study, we investigated different calibration models for the Real-time Affordable Multi-Pollutant (RAMP) sensor package, which measures CO, NO2, O3, and CO2. We explored three methods: (1) laboratory univariate linear regression, (2) empirical multiple linear regression, and (3) machine-learning-based calibration models using random forests (RF). Calibration models were developed for 16–19 RAMP monitors (varied by pollutant) using training and testing windows spanning August 2016 through February 2017 in Pittsburgh, PA, US. The random forest models matched (CO) or significantly outperformed (NO2, CO2, O3) the other calibration models, and their accuracy and precision were robust over time for testing windows of up to 16 weeks. Following calibration, average mean absolute error on the testing data set from the random forest models was 38 ppb for CO (14 % relative error), 10 ppm for CO2 (2 % relative error), 3.5 ppb for NO2 (29 % relative error), and 3.4 ppb for O3 (15 % relative error), and Pearson r versus the reference monitors exceeded 0.8 for most units. Model performance is explored in detail, including a quantification of model variable importance, accuracy across different concentration ranges, and performance in a range of monitoring contexts including the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and the US EPA Air Sensors Guidebook recommendations of minimum data quality for personal exposure measurement. A key strength of the RF approach is that it accounts for pollutant cross-sensitivities. This highlights the importance of developing multipollutant sensor packages (as opposed to single-pollutant monitors); we determined this is especially critical for NO2 and CO2. The evaluation reveals that only the RF-calibrated sensors meet the US EPA Air Sensors Guidebook recommendations of minimum data quality for personal exposure measurement. We also demonstrate that the RF-model-calibrated sensors could detect differences in NO2 concentrations between a near-road site and a suburban site less than 1.5 km away. From this study, we conclude that combining RF models with carefully controlled state-of-the-art multipollutant sensor packages as in the RAMP monitors appears to be a very promising approach to address the poor performance that has plagued low-cost air quality sensors.","",""

Despite the prevalence of covariate shift in real-world applications, a theoretical understanding in the context of modern machine learning has remained lacking. In this work, we examine the exact high-dimensional asymptotics of random feature regression under covariate shift and present a precise characterization of the limiting test error, bias, and variance in this setting. Our results motivate a natural partial order over covariate shifts that provides a sufficient condition for determining when the shift will harm (or even help) test performance. We find that overparameterized models exhibit enhanced robustness to covariate shift, providing one of the first theoretical explanations for this ubiquitous empirical phenomenon. Additionally, our analysis reveals an exact linear relationship between the in-distribution and out-of-distribution generalization performance, offering an explanation for this surprising recent observation.","",""
