Mobile diagnosis of HZ with the assistance of artificial intelligence can prevent neuropathic pain while reducing clinicians’ fatigue and diagnosis cost. However, the clinical images captured from daily mobile devices likely contain visual corruptions, such as motion blur and noise, which can easily mislead the automated system. Hence, this paper aims to train a robust and mobile deep neural network (DNN) that can distinguish HZ from other skin diseases using user-submitted images. To enhance robustness while retaining low computational cost, we propose a knowledge distillation from ensemble via curriculum training (KDE-CT) wherein a student network learns from a stronger teacher network progressively. We established skin diseases dataset for HZ diagnosis and evaluated the robustness against 75 types of corruption. A total of 13 different DNNs was evaluated on both clean and corrupted images. The experiment result shows that the proposed KDE-CT significantly improves corruption robustness when compared with other methods. Our trained MobileNetV3-Small achieved more robust performance (93.5% overall accuracy, 67.6 mean corruption error) than the DNN ensemble with smaller computation (549x fewer multiply-and-accumulate operations), which makes it suitable for mobile skin lesion analysis.","",""

To overcome this limitation, we propose a curriculum-based teacher ensemble that allows for performing robust and efficient knowledge distillation. The proposed method is motivated by the way that humans learn through a curriculum, as well as supported by recent findings that hints to the existence of critical learning periods in neural networks.

After introducing relevant terminology and the goals and range of possible knowledge of both attackers and defenders, we survey recent work on test-time evasion (TTE), data poisoning (DP), backdoor DP, and reverse engineering (RE) attacks and particularly defenses against the same. In so doing, we distinguish robust classification from anomaly detection (AD), unsupervised from supervised, and statistical hypothesis-based defenses from ones that do not have an explicit null (no attack) hypothesis. We also consider several scenarios for detecting backdoors. We provide a technical assessment for reviewed works, including identifying any issues/limitations, required hyperparameters, needed computational complexity, as well as the performance measures evaluated and the obtained quality. We then delve deeper, providing novel insights that challenge conventional AL wisdom and that target unresolved issues, including: robust classification versus AD as a defense strategy; the belief that attack success increases with attack strength, which ignores susceptibility to AD; small perturbations for TTE attacks: a fallacy or a requirement; validity of the universal assumption that a TTE attacker knows the ground-truth class for the example to be attacked; black, gray, or white-box attacks as the standard for defense evaluation; and susceptibility of query-based RE to an AD defense. We also discuss attacks on the privacy of training data. We then present benchmark comparisons of several defenses against TTE, RE, and backdoor DP attacks on images.

Instead of modifying the parameters in a fixed neural network architecture, a close-loop control process is added to generate control signals adaptively for the perturbed or corrupted data. We connect the robustness of neural networks with optimal control using the geometrical information of underlying data to design the control objective. The detailed analysis shows how the embedding manifolds of state trajectory affect error estimation of the proposed method. Our approach can simultaneously maintain the performance on clean data and improve the robustness against many types of data perturbations.

Given a document of any domains, the model needs to figure out the sentiments with respect to fine-grained aspects in the documents. Two main challenges exist in this problem. One is to build a robust document modeling across domains; the other is to mine the domain-specific aspects and make use of the sentiment lexicon. In this paper, we propose a novel approach Neural Attentive model for cross-domain Aspect-level sentiment CLassification (NAACL), which leverages the benefits of the supervised deep neural network as well as the unsupervised probabilistic generative model to strengthen the representation learning. NAACL jointly learns two tasks: (i) a domain classifier, working on documents in both the source and target domains to recognize the domain information of input texts and transfer knowledge from the source domain to the target domain. In particular, a weakly supervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation model (wsLDA) is proposed to learn the domain-specific aspect and sentiment lexicon representations that are then used to calculate the aspect/lexicon-aware document representations via a multi-view attention mechanism; (ii) an aspect-level sentiment classifier, sharing the document modeling with the domain classifier. It makes use of the domain classification results and the aspect/sentiment-aware document representations to classify the aspect-level sentiment of the document in domain adaptation scenario. NAACL is evaluated on both English and Chinese datasets with the out-of-domain as well as in-domain setups. Quantitatively, the experiments demonstrate that NAACL has robust superiority over the compared methods in terms of classification accuracy and F1 score. The qualitative evaluation also shows that the proposed model is capable of reasonably paying attention to those words that are important to judge the sentiment polarity of the input text given an aspect.","",""

A DNN-based acoustic model is trained in terms of minimizing a cost function that is usually penalized by regularizations. Regularization generally reflects prior knowledge that plays a role in constraining the model parameter space. In DNN-based acoustic models, various regularizations have been proposed to improve robustness. However, most approaches do not handle speech generation knowledge even if this process is the most fundamental prior. For example, l1 and l2-norm regularizations are equivalent to set Gaussian prior and Laplacian prior to model parameters respectively. This means that any speech signal specific knowledge is not used for regularization. Manifold-based regularization exploits the local linear structure of observed acoustic features, which are simply realization of the speech generation process. Therefore, to incorporate prior knowledge of speech generation into regularization, we propose a phonetic state relation graph based approach. This method was evaluated on the TIMIT phone recognition domain. The results showed that it reduced the phone error rate from 20.8% to 20.3% under the same conditions.","",""

Recognising different classes of linkable knowledge would support more targeted information needs when users search or explore the knowledge base. Existing methods focus on binary relatedness (i.e., related or not), and are not robust to recognize different classes of semantic relatedness when linkable knowledge units share few words in common (i.e., have lexical gap). In this paper, we formulate the problem of predicting semantically linkable knowledge units as a multiclass classification problem, and solve the problem using deep learning techniques. To overcome the lexical gap issue, we adopt neural language model (word embeddings) and convolutional neural network (CNN) to capture word- and document-level semantics of knowledge units.

In fact, the spatial distribution between objects from different classes has a strong correlation characteristic. For example, buildings tend to be close to roads. In view of the strong appearance extraction ability of DSSN and the powerful topological relationship modeling capability of the graph convolutional neural network (GCN), a DSSN-GCN framework, which combines the advantages of DSSN and GCN, is proposed in this paper for RS image semantic segmentation. To lift the appearance extraction ability, this paper proposes a new DSSN called the attention residual U-shaped network (AttResUNet), which leverages residual blocks to encode feature maps and the attention module to refine the features. As far as GCN, the graph is built, where graph nodes are denoted by the superpixels and the graph weight is calculated by considering the spectral information and spatial information of the nodes. The AttResUNet is trained to extract the high-level features to initialize the graph nodes. Then the GCN combines features and spatial relationships between nodes to conduct classification. It is worth noting that the usage of spatial relationship knowledge boosts the performance and robustness of the classification module. In addition, benefiting from modeling GCN on the superpixel level, the boundaries of objects are restored to a certain extent and there are less pixel-level noises in the final classification result. Extensive experiments on two publicly open datasets show that DSSN-GCN model outperforms the competitive baseline (i.e., the DSSN model) and the DSSN-GCN when adopting AttResUNet achieves the best performance, which demonstrates the advance of our method.","",""

We also investigate a trade-off between the recourse-based fairness and robustness objectives.

As a result, a robust and automated method for analyzing atrial structures in 3-D is of high interest.

By utilizing computationally efficient batch prediction, AtriaNet was able to successfully process each 3-D LGE-MRI within 1 min.

Goal: The main aim of this study was to ensure a novel, consistent, robust, and effective model for fetal hypoxia detection. Methods: In this work, we proposed a novel computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system integrated with an advanced deep learning (DL) algorithm. For a 1-dimensional preprocessed FHR signal, the 2-dimensional image was transformed using recurrence plot (RP), which is considered to greatly capture the non-linear characteristics. The ultimate image dataset was enriched by changing several parameters of the RP and was then used to feed the convolutional neural network (CNN). Compared to conventional machine learning (ML) methods, a CNN can self-learn useful features from the input data and does not perform complex manual feature engineering (i.e., feature extraction and selection). Results: Finally, according to the optimization experiment, the CNN model obtained the average performance using optimal configuration across 10-fold: accuracy = 98.69%, sensitivity = 99.29%, specificity = 98.10%, and area under the curve = 98.70%.

We derive bounds for L spaces, 1 < p < m, recovering the 0(1 /&) bounds of Barron and Jones for the case p = 2. The results were motivated in part by the desire to understand approximation in the more “robust” (resistant to exemplar noise) LP, 1 ~ p <2 norms. Consider the task of approximating a given target function f by a linear combination of n functions from a set S. For example, S may be the set of possible sigmoidal activation functions, {g : ~d ~[% 6 ~d, b E ~, s.t. g(z) = a(a . z + b)}, in which case the approximants are single hidden layer neural networks with a linear output layer. It is known that under very weak conditions on IS (it must be Riemann integrable and nonpolynomial), the linear span of S is dense in the set of continuous functions on compact subsets of ~d (i.e. for all positive c there is a linear combination of functions in S which can approximate any continuous function to within c everywhere on a compact domain) [Leshno et al. 1992]. Consider the important rate of approximation issue, i.e. the rate at which the achievable error reduces as we allow larger subsets of S to be used in const rutting the approximant. In the context of neural networks, this is the question of how the approximation error scales with the number of hidden units in the network. Unfortunately, approximation bounds for target functions ~ arbitrarily located in the linear closure (i.e. the closure of the span) of S are unknown.

Limited case studies have demonstrated the potential of BNs in modeling multiple data streams for eruption forecasting and volcanic hazard assessment. Nevertheless, BNs are not widely employed in volcano observatories. Motivated by the need to assess the probability of fatality when conducting field work, we have worked closely with the New Zealand volcano monitoring team to explore the potential utility of BNs. We adapted a previously published BN for a pilot study to forecast volcanic eruption on Whakaari/White Island. Developing the model structure provided a useful framework for the members of the volcano monitoring team to share their knowledge and interpretation of the volcanic system. We aimed to capture the conceptual understanding of the volcanic processes and represent all observables that are regularly monitored. The pilot model has a total of 30 variables, four of them describing the volcanic processes that can lead to three different types of eruptions: phreatic, magmatic explosive and magmatic effusive. The remaining 23 variables are grouped into observations related to seismicity, fluid geochemistry and surface manifestations. To estimate the model parameters, we held a workshop with eleven experts, including two from outside the monitoring team. To reduce the number of conditional probabilities that the experts needed to estimate, each variable is described by only two states. However, experts were concerned about this limitation, in particular for continuous data. Therefore, they were reluctant to define thresholds to distinguish between states. We conclude that volcano monitoring requires BN modeling techniques that can accommodate continuous variables. More work is required to link unobservable (latent) processes with observables and with eruptive patterns, and to model dynamic processes. A provisional application of the pilot model revealed several key insights. Refining the BN modeling techniques will help advance understanding of volcanoes and improve capabilities for forecasting volcanic eruptions. We consider that BNs will become essential for handling ever-burgeoning observations, and for assessing data’s evidential meaning for operational eruption forecasting.","",""

One of the open issues in hand-vein verification is the lack of robustness against image quality degradation, which may comprise the verification accuracy. To achieve robust verification, vein feature extraction approaches, especially vein texture segmentation, have been extensively investigated. In recent years, deep neural networks have achieved promising results in medical image segmentation and have been brought into vein verification, but current solutions suffer from two challenges for vein segmentation: 1) lacking the labeling data, which is expensive to obtain and 2) the incorrect label data obtained by manual labeling scheme or automatic labeling scheme may strongly influence parameters when the network is trained, which may degrade the verification performance. This paper proposes an iterative deep belief network (DBN) to extract vein features based on the initial label data, which are automatically generated using a very limited a priori knowledge and iteratively corrected by our DBN. First, a known handcrafted vein image segmentation technique is employed to automatically label vein pixel and background pixel. A training dataset is constructed based on the patches centered on the labeled pixels. Second, a DBN is trained on the resulting database to predict the probability of each pixel to belong to be a vein pixel given a patch centered on it. The vein patterns are segmented using a probability threshold of 0.5. The resulting vein features are employed to reconstruct the training dataset, based on which the network is retrained. During the iterative procedure, the incorrect labels of training data are statistically corrected, which enables DBN to effectively learn what a finger-vein pattern is by learning the difference between vein patterns and background ones. The experimental results on two public hand-vein databases show a significant improvement in terms of hand-vein verification accuracy.","",""

Furthermore, the proposed controller can compensate for the leader's unknown bounded input and actuator faults. Besides, the closed‐loop system is proven to be stable by the developed controller, and all followers can track the state of the leader. Finally, a numerical simulation is given to validate the effectiveness of the proposed protocol.","",""

The challenge becomes how to intelligently combine patch-level classification results and model the fact that not all patches will be discriminative. We propose to train a decision fusion model to aggregate patch-level predictions given by patch-level CNNs, which to the best of our knowledge has not been shown before. Furthermore, we formulate a novel Expectation-Maximization (EM) based method that automatically locates discriminative patches robustly by utilizing the spatial relationships of patches.

In many applications, feed-forward neural networks are heavily involved in the implementation of controllers by learning and representing control laws through several methods such as model predictive control (MPC) and reinforcement learning (RL). The type of networks that we consider in this manuscript are feed-forward neural networks consisting of multiple hidden layers with ReLU activation functions and a linear activation function in the output layer. While neural network controllers have been able to achieve desirable performance in many contexts, they also present a unique challenge in that it is difficult to provide any guarantees about the correctness of their behavior or reason about the stability a system that employs their use. Thus, from a controls perspective, it is necessary to verify them in conjunction with their corresponding plants in closed-loop. While there have been a handful of works proposed towards the verification of closed-loop systems with feed-forward neural network controllers, this area still lacks attention and a unified set of benchmark examples on which verification techniques can be evaluated and compared. Thus, to this end, we present a range of closed-loop control systems ranging from two to six state variables, and a range of controllers with sizes in the range of eleven neurons to a few hundred neurons in more complex systems.

In recent years, advances in Artficial Intelligence (AI) have enabled a diverse range of technologies that are directly impacting people’s everyday lives [16]. Particularly, within this space, machine learning methods such as Deep Learning (DL) have achieved levels of accuracy and performance that are competitive or better than humans for tasks such as pattern and image recognition [12], natural language processing [7], and knowledge representation and reasoning [15,22]. Despite these achievements, there have been reservations about incorporating them into safety critical systems [11] due to their susceptibility to unexpected and errant behavior from a slight perturbation in their inputs [18]. Furthermore, neural networks are often viewed as ""black boxes"" since the underlying operation of the neuron activations is often indiscernible [22]. In light of these challenges, there has been significant work towards the creation of methods and verification tools that can formally reason about the behavior of neural networks [22]. However, the vast majority of these techniques have only been able to deal with feed-forward neural networks with piecewise-linear activation functions [4]. Additionally, the bulk of these methods have primarily considered the verification of input-output properties of neural networks in isolation [22], and there are only a handful of works that have explicitly addressed the verification of closed-loop control systems with neural network controllers [5, 8, 19–21]. One of the central challenges in verifying neural network control systems is that applying existing methodology to these systems is not straightforward [9], and a simple combination of verification tools for non-linear ordinary differential equations along with a neural network reachability tool suffers from severe overestimation errors [5]. Still, the verification of closed loop neural network systems is deeply important as they naturally arise in safety critical systems [5] such as autonomous vehicles, and complex control systems that make use of model predictive control and reinforcement learning [16]. Thus, there is a compelling need for methods and advanced software tools that can effectively deal with the complexities exhibited by these systems [5]. Inspired by a shortage of verification methods for closed-loop neural network control systems in the research literature, the central contribution of this paper is the provision of a set of executable benchmarks that have been synthesized using methods such as reinforcement learning [17], and model predictive control [14]. The problems elucidated in the paper are modeled using Simulink/Stateflow (SLSF) and are available at the following github repository1. We aim to provide a thorough problem description to which the numerous tools and approaches for non-linear systems and neural network verification present in the research community can be evaluated and compared [22]. If the research community is able to devise acceptable solutions to the aformentioned challenges they will stimulate the development of robust and intelligent systems with the potential to bring unparalleled benefits to numerous application domains. 2 Description of benchmarks.

The buildings HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) systems, whose functionality is to maintain thermal comfort and indoor air quality (IAQ), account for almost half of the energy consumed by the buildings. Thus, intelligent scheduling of the building HVAC system has the potential for tremendous energy and cost savings while ensuring that the control objectives (thermal comfort, air quality) are satisfied. Traditionally, rule-based and model-based approaches such as linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) have been used for scheduling HVAC. However, the system complexity of HVAC and the dynamism in the building environment limit the accuracy, efficiency and robustness of such methods. Recently, several works have focused on model-free deep reinforcement learning based techniques such as Deep Q-Network (DQN). Such methods require extensive interactions with the environment. Thus, they are impractical to implement in real systems due to low sample efficiency. Safety-aware exploration is another challenge in real systems since certain actions at particular states may result in catastrophic outcomes. To address these issues and challenges, we propose a modelbased reinforcement learning approach that learns the system dynamics using a neural network. Then, we adopt Model Predictive Control (MPC) using the learned system dynamics to perform control with random-sampling shooting method. To ensure safe exploration, we limit the actions within safe range and the maximum absolute change of actions according to prior knowledge. We evaluate our ideas through simulation using widely adopted EnergyPlus tool on a case study consisting of a two zone data-center. Experiments show that the average deviation of the trajectories sampled from the learned dynamics and the ground truth is below 20%. Compared with baseline approaches, we reduce the total energy consumption by 17.1% ~ 21.8%.

In contrast to other tuning techniques such as Ziegler– Nichols or genetic algorithms (GA), our proposal allows a real-time adjustment of the tuning parameters according to the network conditions. Thus, the new algorithm provides an online control of the tuning process unlike the ZN and GA techniques, whose tuning parameters are calculated offline. The algorithm, called neural network service level PID (NNSPID), guarantees minimum bandwidth levels to users depending on their service level agreement, and it is compared with a tuning technique based on genetic algorithms (GASPID). The simulation study demonstrates that NN-SPID continuously adapts the tuning parameters, achieving lower fluctuations than GA-SPID in the allocation process. As a consequence, it provides a more stable response than GA-SPID since it needs to launch the GA to obtain new tuning values. Furthermore, NN-SPID guarantees the minimum bandwidth levels faster than GA-SPID. Finally, NN-SPID is more robust than GA-SPID under real-time changes of the guaranteed bandwidth levels, as GA-SPID shows high fluctuations in the allocated bandwidth, especially just after any change is made.","",""

This paper addresses this issue by proposing a novel framework for the binaural sound localization that combines the model-based information about the spectral characteristics of sound sources and deep neural networks (DNNs). A target source model and a background source model are first estimated during a training phase using spectral features extracted from sound signals in isolation. When the identity of the background source is not available, a universal background model can be used. During testing, the source models are used jointly to explain the mixed observations and improve the localization process by selectively weighting source azimuth posteriors output by a DNN-based localization system. To address the possible mismatch between the training and testing, a model adaptation process is further employed the on-the-fly during testing, which adapts the background model parameters directly from the noisy observations in an iterative manner. The proposed system, therefore, combines the model-based and data-driven information flow within a single computational framework. The evaluation task involved localization of a target speech source in the presence of an interfering source and room reverberation. Our experiments show that by exploiting the model-based information in this way, the sound localization performance can be improved substantially under various noisy and reverberant conditions.","",""

Referred to as the neural variability, it is well known in neuroscience that human brain reactions exhibit substantial variability even in response to the same stimulus. This mechanism balances accuracy and plasticity/flexibility in the motor learning of natural nervous systems. Thus, it motivates us to design a similar mechanism, named artificial neural variability (ANV), that helps artificial neural networks learn some advantages from “natural” neural networks.

In contrast to the widely used spatial regularisation or feature selection methods, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that channel selection has been advocated for DCF-based tracking. We demonstrate that our GFS-DCF method is able to significantly improve the performance of a DCF tracker equipped with deep neural network features. In addition, our GFS-DCF enables joint feature selection and filter learning, achieving enhanced discrimination and interpretability of the learned filters. To further improve the performance, we adaptively integrate historical information by constraining filters to be smooth across temporal frames, using an efficient low-rank approximation. By design, specific temporal-spatial-channel configurations are dynamically learned in the tracking process, highlighting the relevant features, and alleviating the performance degrading impact of less discriminative representations and reducing information redundancy. The experimental results obtained on OTB2013, OTB2015, VOT2017, VOT2018 and TrackingNet demonstrate the merits of our GFS-DCF and its superiority over the state-of-the-art trackers.

Recently, emerging machine learning techniques have had a promising impact on turbulence modeling, but are still in their infancy regarding widespread industrial adoption. Toward their extensive uptake, this paper presents a universally interpretable machine learning (UIML) framework for turbulence modeling, which consists of two parallel machine learning-based modules to directly infer the structural and parametric representations of turbulence physics, respectively. At each phase of model development, data reflecting the evolution dynamics of turbulence and domain knowledge representing prior physical considerations are converted into modeling knowledge. The data- and knowledge-driven UIML is investigated with a deep residual network. The following three aspects are demonstrated in detail: (i) a compact input feature parameterizing a new turbulent timescale is introduced to prevent nonunique mappings between conventional input arguments and output Reynolds stress; (ii) a realizability limiter is developed to overcome the under-constrained state of modeled stress; and (iii) fairness and noise-insensitivity constraints are included in the training procedure. Consequently, an invariant, realizable, unbiased, and robust data-driven turbulence model is achieved. The influences of the training dataset size, activation function, and network hyperparameter on the performance are also investigated. The resulting model exhibits good generalization across two- and three-dimensional flows, and captures the effects of the Reynolds number and aspect ratio. Finally, the underlying rationale behind prediction is explored.","",""

An advantage of the present critic network update law is that it can relax the persistence of excitation condition.

Integral barrier Lyapunov functionals are constructed to handle the unknown affine control gains (g(·)) with state constraints simultaneously. This removes the need on the knowledge of control gains for control design and avoids the conservative step of transforming original state constraints into new bounds on tracking errors. Neural networks (NNs) are used to approximate the unknown continuous packaged functions. To enhance the robustness, adapting parameters are developed to compensate the unknown bounds on NNs approximations and external disturbances. Design parameters-dependent feasibility conditions are formulated as sufficient conditions for the existence of feasible design parameters to guarantee the state constraints, and an offline constrained optimization step is proposed to obtain the optimal design parameters prior to the implementation of the proposed control. It is proved that the proposed control can guarantee the semiglobal uniform ultimate boundedness of all signals in closed-loop system, all states are ensured to remain in the predefined constrained state space, and tracking error converges to an adjustable neighborhood of the origin by choosing appropriate design parameters.

While being able to bring reliable robustness, adversarial training (AT) methods in general favor high capacity models, i.e., the larger the model the better the robustness. This tends to limit their effectiveness on small models, which are more preferable in scenarios where storage or computing resources are very limited (e.g., mobile devices). In this paper, we leverage the concept of knowledge distillation to improve the robustness of small models by distilling from adversarially trained large models. We first revisit several state-of-the-art AT methods from a distillation perspective and identify one common technique that can lead to improved robustness: the use of robust soft labels – predictions of a robust model. Following this observation, we propose a novel adversarial robustness distillation method called Robust Soft Label Adversarial Distillation (RSLAD) to train robust small student models. RSLAD fully exploits the robust soft labels produced by a robust (adversarially-trained) large teacher model to guide the student’s learning on both natural and adversarial examples in all loss terms. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our RSLAD approach over existing adversarial training and distillation methods in improving the robustness of small models against state-of-the-art attacks including the AutoAttack.

METHODS A 3D Convolutional Neural Network was trained for automatic bladder segmentation of the CT scans. The automatic bladder segmentation alongside the CT scan are jointly optimized to add explicit knowledge about the underlying anatomy to the registration algorithm. We included three datasets from different institutes and CT manufacturers. The first was used for training and testing the ConvNet, where the second and the third were used for evaluation of the proposed pipeline. The system performance was quantified geometrically using the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), the Mean Surface Distance (MSD), and the 95% Hausdorff Distance (HD). The propagated contours were validated clinically through generating the associated IMPT plans and compare it with the IMPT plans based on the manual delineations. Propagated contours were considered clinically acceptable if their treatment plans met the dosimetric coverage constraints on the manual contours.   RESULTS The bladder segmentation network achieved a DSC of 88% and 82% on the test datasets. The proposed registration pipeline achieved a MSD of 1:29±0:39, 1:48±1:16, and 1:49±0:44 mm for the prostate, seminal vesicles, and lymph nodes, respectively on the second dataset and a MSD of 2:31 ± 1:92 and 1:76 ± 1:39 mm for the prostate and seminal vesicles on the third dataset. The automatically propagated contours met the dose coverage constraints in 86%, 91%, and 99% of the cases for the prostate, seminal vesicles, and lymph nodes, respectively. A Conservative Success Rate (CSR) of 80% was obtained, compared to 65% when only using intensity-based registration.   CONCLUSION The proposed registration pipeline obtained highly promising results for generating treatment plans adapted to the daily anatomy. With 80% of the automatically generated treatment plans directly usable without manual correction, a substantial improvement in system robustness was reached compared to a previous approach. The proposed method therefore facilitates more precise proton therapy of prostate cancer, potentially leading to fewer treatment related adverse side effects. This article is protected by copyright.

We achieve this by first training a small network (with lesser parameters) on a small subset of the original dataset, and then gradually expanding the network using Net2Net transformation to train incrementally on larger subsets of the dataset. This incremental training strategy with Net2Net utilizes function-preserving transformations that transfers knowledge from each previous small network to the next larger network, thereby, reducing the overall training complexity. Our experiments demonstrate that compared with training from scratch, cumulative training yields ~2x reduction in computational complexity for training TinyImageNet using VGG19 at iso-accuracy. Besides training efficiency, a key advantage of our cumulative training strategy is that we can perform pruning during Net2Net expansion to obtain a final network with optimal configuration (~0.4x lower inference compute complexity) compared to conventional training from scratch. We also demonstrate that the final network obtained from cumulative training yields better generalization performance and noise robustness. Further, we show that mutual inference from all the networks created with cumulative Net2Net expansion enables improved adversarial input detection.","",""

In addition, it reduces the storage and computation requirements of deep neural networks (DNNs) and accelerates the inference process dramatically. Existing methods mainly rely on manual constraints such as normalization to select the filters. A typical pipeline comprises two stages: first pruning the original neural network and then fine-tuning the pruned model. However, choosing a manual criterion can be somehow tricky and stochastic. Moreover, directly regularizing and modifying filters in the pipeline suffer from being sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters, thus making the pruning procedure less robust. To address these challenges, we propose to handle the filter pruning issue through one stage: using an attention-based architecture that adaptively fuses the filter selection with filter learning in a unified network. Specifically, we present a pruning method named adding before pruning (ABP) to make the model focus on the filters of higher significance by training instead of man-made criteria such as norm, rank, etc. First, we add an auxiliary attention layer into the original model and set the significance scores in this layer to be binary. Furthermore, to propagate the gradients in the auxiliary attention layer, we design a specific gradient estimator and prove its effectiveness for convergence in the graph flow through mathematical derivation. In the end, to relieve the dependence on the complicated prior knowledge for designing the thresholding criterion, we simultaneously prune and train the filters to automatically eliminate network redundancy with recoverability. Extensive experimental results on the two typical image classification benchmarks, CIFAR-10 and ILSVRC-2012, illustrate that the proposed approach performs favorably against previous state-of-the-art filter pruning algorithms.","",""

The present work focuses on using SNNs in combination with deep reinforcement learning in ATARI games, which involves additional complexity as compared to image classification. We review the theory of converting DNNs to SNNs and extending the conversion to Deep Q-Networks (DQNs). We propose a robust representation of the firing rate to reduce the error during the conversion process. In addition, we introduce a new metric to evaluate the conversion process by comparing the decisions made by the DQN and SNN, respectively. We also analyze how the simulation time and parameter normalization influence the performance of converted SNNs. We achieve competitive scores on 17 top-performing Atari games. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to achieve state-of-the-art performance on multiple Atari games with SNNs.

With inspiration from the human visual system, we propose a light-weight model-agnostic method, namely Informative Dropout (InfoDrop), to improve interpretability and reduce texture bias. Specifically, we discriminate texture from shape based on local self-information in an image, and adopt a Dropout-like algorithm to decorrelate the model output from the local texture.

First, we propose a new margin-based surrogate loss function for the AUC score (named as the AUC margin loss). It is more robust than the commonly used AUC square loss, while enjoying the same advantage in terms of large-scale stochastic optimization. Second, we conduct empirical studies of our DAM method on difficult medical image classification tasks, namely classification of chest x-ray images for identifying many threatening diseases and classification of images of skin lesions for identifying melanoma.

Some methods replace the one-way knowledge distillation from a static teacher with collaborative learning between a cohort of students. Despite the recent advances, a clear understanding of where knowledge resides in a deep neural network and an optimal method for capturing knowledge from teacher and transferring it to student remains an open question. In this study, we provide an extensive study on nine different KD methods which covers a broad spectrum of approaches to capture and transfer knowledge.

While the effect of factors such as model capacity and scale of training data on adversarial robustness have been extensively studied, little attention has been paid to the effect of a very important parameter in every network optimization on adversarial robustness: the learning rate. In particular, we hypothesize that effective learning rate scheduling during adversarial training can significantly reduce the overfitting issue, to a degree where one does not even need to adversarially train a model from scratch but can instead simply adversarially fine-tune a pre-trained model. Motivated by this hypothesis, we propose a simple yet very effective adversarial fine-tuning approach based on a ‘slow start, fast decay’ learning rate scheduling strategy which not only significantly decreases computational cost required, but also greatly improves the accuracy and robustness of a deep neural network. Experimental results show that the proposed adversarial fine-tuning approach outperforms the state-ofthe-art methods on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets in both test accuracy and the robustness, while reducing the computational cost by 8–10×. Furthermore, a very important benefit of the proposed adversarial finetuning approach is that it enables the ability to improve the robustness of any pre-trained deep neural network without needing to train the model from scratch, which to the best of the authors’ knowledge has not been previously demonstrated in research literature.","",""

INTRODUCTION Solar radiation data are required for a number of solar thermal and Solar photovoltaic applications like solar power generation, solar heating, cooking, drying and solar passive design of buildings [1–4]. The measured solar radiation data are not available for most of the sites due to high cost, maintenance of the measuring instruments. As such, various empirical models have been used to predict monthly mean daily solar radiation all over the world [5–9]. The Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are used to solve a number of scientific problems. It has the capability to approximate any continuous non-linear function to arbitrary accuracy [10]. A multi-layer feed-forward neural network can approximate a continuous function due to its robustness, parallel architecture and fault tolerance capability. In past years, ANN models are used by a number of researchers to estimate solar radiation [11–15] and concluded that ANN model are proven to be superior to other empirical regression models. Reddy [11] used Radial Basis Functions (RBF) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models to predict solar radiation using data from eight stations in Oman. So¨zen [12] determined the solar-energy potential in Turkey using artificial neural networks.

M.A. Behrang et. al [17] predicted DATAdaily global solar radiation for Dezful city in Iran by using different ANN techniques based on different combination of meteorological variables (day of the year, daily mean air temperature, relative humidity, sunshine hours, evaporation and wind speed). The MAPE for the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) network is 5.21% while this value is 5.56% for Radial Basis Function (RBF) network. Mohandes et al. [16] has used RBF network for modeling solar radiation and compares its performance with MLP model by using latitude, longitude, altitude and sunshine duration as input parameters.

However, these proposed analog accelerators suffer from the intrinsic noise generated by their physical components, which makes it challenging to achieve high accuracy on deep neural networks.

ABSTRACT Machine learning has proven to be a powerful method to predict antimicrobial resistance (AMR) without using prior knowledge for selected bacterial species-antimicrobial combinations. To date, only species-specific machine learning models have been developed, and to the best of our knowledge, the inclusion of information from multiple species has not been attempted. The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility of including information from multiple bacterial species to predict AMR for an individual species, since this may make it easier to train and update resistance predictions for multiple species and may lead to improved predictions. Whole-genome sequence data and susceptibility profiles from 3,528 Mycobacterium tuberculosis, 1,694 Escherichia coli, 658 Salmonella enterica, and 1,236 Staphylococcus aureus isolates were included. We developed machine learning models trained by the features of the PointFinder and ResFinder programs detected to predict binary (susceptible/resistant) AMR profiles. We tested four feature representation methods to determine the most efficient way for introducing features into the models. When training the model only on the Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates, high prediction performances were obtained for the six AMR profiles included. By adding information on ciprofloxacin from the additional 3,588 isolates, there was no reduction in performance for the other antimicrobials but an increased performance for ciprofloxacin AMR profile prediction for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Escherichia coli. In conclusion, the species-independent models can predict multi-AMR profiles for multiple species without losing any robustness. IMPORTANCE Machine learning is a proven method to predict AMR; however, the performance of any machine learning model depends on the quality of the input data. Therefore, we evaluated different methods of representing information about mutations as well as mobilizable genes, so that the information can serve as input for a robust model.

Several transcription factors act early at the NB, but the initiating molecular events remain elusive. Recent data from basal vertebrates suggest that ap2 might have been critical for NC emergence; however, the role of AP2 factors at the NB remains unclear. We show here that AP2a initiates NB patterning and is sufficient to elicit a NB-like pattern in neuralized ectoderm. In contrast, the other early regulators do not participate in ap2a initiation at the NB, but cooperate to further establish a robust NB pattern. The NC regulatory network uses a multistep cascade of secreted inducers and transcription factors, first at the NB and then within the NC progenitors. Here we report that AP2a acts at two distinct steps of this cascade. As the earliest known NB specifier, AP2a mediates Wnt signals to initiate the NB and activate pax3; as a NC specifier, AP2a regulates further NC development independent of and downstream of NB patterning. Our findings reconcile conflicting observations from various vertebrate organisms. AP2a provides a paradigm for the reiterated use of multifunctional molecules, thereby facilitating emergence of the NC in vertebrates.","",""

A key remaining challenge lies in developing programming paradigms for molecular computation that are well-aligned with the underlying chemical hardware and do not attempt to shoehorn ill-fitting electronics paradigms. We discover a surprisingly tight connection between a popular class of neural networks (binary-weight ReLU aka BinaryConnect) and a class of coupled chemical reactions that are absolutely robust to reaction rates. The robustness of rate-independent chemical computation makes it a promising target for bioengineering implementation. We show how a BinaryConnect neural network trained in silico using well-founded deep learning optimization techniques, can be compiled to an equivalent chemical reaction network, providing a novel molecular programming paradigm. We illustrate such translation on the paradigmatic IRIS and MNIST datasets. Toward intended applications of chemical computation, we further use our method to generate a chemical reaction network that can discriminate between different virus types based on gene expression levels. Our work sets the stage for rich knowledge transfer between neural network and molecular programming communities.","",""

Spectral CT is especially suited for imaging with K-edge contrast agents to address the otherwise limited contrast in soft tissues. We have developed a micro-CT system based on a PCXD. This system enables both 4 energy bins acquisition, as well as full-spectrum mode in which the energy thresholds of the PCXD are swept to sample the full energy spectrum for each detector element and projection angle. Measurements provided by the PCXD, however, are distorted due to undesirable physical effects in the detector and can be very noisy due to photon starvation in narrow energy bins. To address spectral distortions, we propose and demonstrate a novel artificial neural network (ANN)-based spectral distortion correction mechanism, which learns to undo the distortion in spectral CT, resulting in improved material decomposition accuracy. To address noise, post-reconstruction denoising based on bilateral filtration, which jointly enforces intensity gradient sparsity between spectral samples, is used to further improve the robustness of ANN training and material decomposition accuracy. Our ANN-based distortion correction method is calibrated using 3D-printed phantoms and a model of our spectral CT system. To enable realistic simulations and validation of our method, we first modeled the spectral distortions using experimental data acquired from (109)Cd and (133)Ba radioactive sources measured with our PCXD. Next, we trained an ANN to learn the relationship between the distorted spectral CT projections and the ideal, distortion-free projections in a calibration step. This required knowledge of the ground truth, distortion-free spectral CT projections, which were obtained by simulating a spectral CT scan of the digital version of a 3D-printed phantom. Once the training was completed, the trained ANN was used to perform distortion correction on any subsequent scans of the same system with the same parameters. We used joint bilateral filtration to perform noise reduction by jointly enforcing intensity gradient sparsity between the reconstructed images for each energy bin. Following reconstruction and denoising, the CT data was spectrally decomposed using the photoelectric effect, Compton scattering, and a K-edge material (i.e. iodine). The ANN-based distortion correction approach was tested using both simulations and experimental data acquired in phantoms and a mouse with our PCXD-based micro-CT system for 4 bins and full-spectrum acquisition modes. The iodine detectability and decomposition accuracy were assessed using the contrast-to-noise ratio and relative error in iodine concentration estimation metrics in images with and without distortion correction. In simulation, the material decomposition accuracy in the reconstructed data was vastly improved following distortion correction and denoising, with 50% and 20% reductions in material concentration measurement error in full-spectrum and 4 energy bins cases, respectively. Overall, experimental data confirms that full-spectrum mode provides superior results to 4-energy mode when the distortion corrections are applied. The material decomposition accuracy in the reconstructed data was vastly improved following distortion correction and denoising, with as much as a 41% reduction in material concentration measurement error for full-spectrum mode, while also bringing the iodine detectability to 4-6 mg ml(-1). Distortion correction also improved the 4 bins mode data, but to a lesser extent. The results demonstrate the experimental feasibility and potential advantages of ANN-based distortion correction and joint bilateral filtration-based denoising for accurate K-edge imaging with a PCXD. Given the computational efficiency with which the ANN can be applied to projection data, the proposed scheme can be readily integrated into existing CT reconstruction pipelines.","",""
