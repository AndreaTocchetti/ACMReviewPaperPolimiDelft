Robustness contracts can encompass and generalize a variety of notions of robustness which were previously proposed in the literature. They can seamlessly apply to NN-based perception as well as deep reinforcement learning (RL)-enabled control applications. We present a sound and complete algorithm that can efficiently verify the satisfaction of a class of robustness contracts on NNs by leveraging notions from Lagrangian duality to identify system configurations that violate the contracts.

In this paper, we propose RS-CNN, namely, Relation-Shape Convolutional Neural Network, which extends regular grid CNN to irregular configuration for point cloud analysis. The key to RS-CNN is learning from relation, i.e., the geometric topology constraint among points. Specifically, the convolutional weight for local point set is forced to learn a high-level relation expression from predefined geometric priors, between a sampled point from this point set and the others. In this way, an inductive local representation with explicit reasoning about the spatial layout of points can be obtained, which leads to much shape awareness and robustness. With this convolution as a basic operator, RS-CNN, a hierarchical architecture can be developed to achieve contextual shape-aware learning for point cloud analysis. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks across three tasks verify RS-CNN achieves the state of the arts.","",""

In contrast, deep neural networks are usually designed to process one particular information stream and susceptible to various types of adversarial perturbations. While many methods exist for detecting and defending against adversarial attacks, they do not generalise across a range of attacks and negatively affect performance on clean, unperturbed data. We developed a fusion model using a combination of background and foreground features extracted in parallel from Places-CNN and Imagenet-CNN. We tested the benefits of the fusion approach on preserving adversarial robustness for human perceivable (e.g., Gaussian blur) and network perceivable (e.g., gradient-based) attacks for CIFAR-10 and MS COCO data sets. For gradient based attacks, our results show that fusion allows for significant improvements in classification without decreasing performance on unperturbed data and without need to perform adversarial retraining. Our fused model revealed improvements for Gaussian blur type perturbations as well. The increase in performance from fusion approach depended on the variability of the image contexts; larger increases were seen for classes of images with larger differences in their contexts.

We collect symbolic constraints corresponding to the network’s response to concrete inputs, while efficiently rejecting inputs whose responses have been seen before. We further propose a quantification procedure for the collected constraints, producing arbitrarily tight, sound interval bounds on the estimated probabilities. The proposed approach is an anytime algorithm, increasing in precision with more paths explored. We implemented our approach in SpaceScanner and demonstrate its potential in analyzing fairness, robustness, and sensitivity properties of neural networks.","",""

This dissertation presents several classes of composite neural networks which are trained to provide appealing solutions to the problem of knowledge acquisition. The value of the network parameters, after sufficient training, are then utilized to generate production rules on the basis of preselected meaningful coordinates. Neural networks are attracting a lot of interest in the scientific community because of their dynamical nature: robustness, capability of generalization and fault tolerance. Neural networks have already proven useful in low level information processing (e.g. signal analysis). However, an apparent disadvantage of traditional neural networks (i.e. backpropagation networks) is that they do not provide explanations of their response i.e. explicit rules or logical reasoning processes. The classes of composite neural networks studied in this dissertation integrate the paradigm of neural networks with the rule-based approach, rendering them more useful than either. It is shown that the composite neural networks act as Bayesian classifiers, and more importantly, can provide density estimates of the class variables. The dissertation provides a mathematical framework for achieving reasonable generalization properties of composite neural networks serving as universal approximators via an appropriate training algorithm (supervised decision-directed learning). The algorithm is based on an approach that divides the input (feature) space into proper subsets (e.g. hyperspheres, hyperrectangles, or hyperellipsoids), represented as portions of the trained composite neural networks, while the complete structures provide acceptable knowledge representations of the data.  The new concepts and methods presented in the dissertation are illustrated via two traditional academic pattern recognition examples and one practical example from medical diagnosis. These examples are discussed in detail. Finally the dissertation concludes with a summary of the most important results accomplished and with brief recommendation for future work.","",""

The fundamental idea behind the design of most neural networks is to learn similarity patterns from data for prediction and inference, which lacks the ability of cognitive reasoning. However, the concrete ability of reasoning is critical to many theoretical and practical problems. On the other hand, traditional symbolic reasoning methods do well in making logical inference, but they are mostly hard rule-based reasoning, which limits their generalization ability to different tasks since difference tasks may require different rules. Both reasoning and generalization ability are important for prediction tasks such as recommender systems, where reasoning provides strong connection between user history and target items for accurate prediction, and generalization helps the model to draw a robust user portrait over noisy inputs. In this paper, we propose Logic-Integrated Neural Network (LINN) to integrate the power of deep learning and logic reasoning. LINN is a dynamic neural architecture that builds the computational graph according to input logical expressions. It learns basic logical operations such as AND, OR, NOT as neural modules, and conducts propositional logical reasoning through the network for inference. Experiments on theoretical task show that LINN achieves significant performance on solving logical equations and variables.

The reasoning labels are jointly learned with the traditional classification labels. This joint training enables the model to predict a set of reasoning labels with every predicted class label.

Relation detection plays an important role in the KBQA system, which finds a compatible answer by analyzing the semantics of questions and querying and reasoning with multiple KB triples. Significant progress has been made by deep neural networks. However, existing methods often concern on detecting single-hop relation without path reasoning, and a few of these methods exploit the multihop relation reasoning, which involves the answer reasoning from the noisy and abundant relational paths in the KB. Meanwhile, the relatedness between question and answer candidates has received little attention and remains unsolved. This article proposes a novel knowledge-based reasoning network (KRN) for relation detection, including both single-hop relation and multihop relation. To address the semantic gap problem in question-answer interaction, we first learn attentive question representations according to the influence of answer aspects. Then, we learn the single-hop relation sequence through different levels of abstraction and adopt the KB entity and structure information to denoise the multihop relation detection task. Finally, we adopt a Siamese network to measure the similarity between question representation and relation representation for both single-hop and multihop relation KBQA tasks. We conduct experiments on two well-known benchmarks, SimpleQuestions and WebQSP, and the results show the superiority of our approach over the state-of-the-art models for both single-hop and multihop relation detection.

However, various working requirements and the oceanic environment may cause some uncertain and unfavorable factors for ship-mounted crane control. In particular, to accomplish different control tasks, some plant parameters (e.g., boom lengths, payload masses, and so on) frequently change; hence, most existing model-based controllers cannot ensure satisfactory control performance any longer. For example, inaccurate gravity compensation may result in positioning errors. Additionally, due to ship roll motions caused by sea waves, residual payload swing generally exists, which may result in safety risks in practice. To solve the above-mentioned issues, this paper designs a neural network-based adaptive control method that can provide effective control for both actuated and unactuated state variables based on the original nonlinear ship-mounted crane dynamics without any linearizing operations. In particular, the proposed update law availably compensates parameter/structure uncertainties for ship-mounted crane systems. Based on a 2-D sliding surface, the boom and rope can arrive at their preset positions in finite time, and the payload swing can be completely suppressed. Furthermore, the problem of nonlinear input dead zones is also taken into account. The stability of the equilibrium point of all state variables in ship-mounted crane systems is theoretically proven by a rigorous Lyapunov-based analysis.

Recently, several approaches have been proposed enabling one to understand and interpret the reasoning embodied in a DNN for a single test image. These methods quantify the “importance” of individual pixels with respect to the classification decision and allow a visualization in terms of a heatmap in pixel/input space. While the usefulness of heatmaps can be judged subjectively by a human, an objective quality measure is missing. In this paper, we present a general methodology based on region perturbation for evaluating ordered collections of pixels such as heatmaps. We compare heatmaps computed by three different methods on the SUN397, ILSVRC2012, and MIT Places data sets. Our main result is that the recently proposed layer-wise relevance propagation algorithm qualitatively and quantitatively provides a better explanation of what made a DNN arrive at a particular classification decision than the sensitivity-based approach or the deconvolution method.

In many applications, feed-forward neural networks are heavily involved in the implementation of controllers by learning and representing control laws through several methods such as model predictive control (MPC) and reinforcement learning (RL). The type of networks that we consider in this manuscript are feed-forward neural networks consisting of multiple hidden layers with ReLU activation functions and a linear activation function in the output layer. While neural network controllers have been able to achieve desirable performance in many contexts, they also present a unique challenge in that it is difficult to provide any guarantees about the correctness of their behavior or reason about the stability a system that employs their use. Thus, from a controls perspective, it is necessary to verify them in conjunction with their corresponding plants in closed-loop. While there have been a handful of works proposed towards the verification of closed-loop systems with feed-forward neural network controllers, this area still lacks attention and a unified set of benchmark examples on which verification techniques can be evaluated and compared. Thus, to this end, we present a range of closed-loop control systems ranging from two to six state variables, and a range of controllers with sizes in the range of eleven neurons to a few hundred neurons in more complex systems.

In recent years, advances in Artficial Intelligence (AI) have enabled a diverse range of technologies that are directly impacting people’s everyday lives [16]. Particularly, within this space, machine learning methods such as Deep Learning (DL) have achieved levels of accuracy and performance that are competitive or better than humans for tasks such as pattern and image recognition [12], natural language processing [7], and knowledge representation and reasoning [15,22]. Despite these achievements, there have been reservations about incorporating them into safety critical systems [11] due to their susceptibility to unexpected and errant behavior from a slight perturbation in their inputs [18]. Furthermore, neural networks are often viewed as ""black boxes"" since the underlying operation of the neuron activations is often indiscernible [22]. In light of these challenges, there has been significant work towards the creation of methods and verification tools that can formally reason about the behavior of neural networks [22]. However, the vast majority of these techniques have only been able to deal with feed-forward neural networks with piecewise-linear activation functions [4]. Additionally, the bulk of these methods have primarily considered the verification of input-output properties of neural networks in isolation [22], and there are only a handful of works that have explicitly addressed the verification of closed-loop control systems with neural network controllers [5, 8, 19–21]. One of the central challenges in verifying neural network control systems is that applying existing methodology to these systems is not straightforward [9], and a simple combination of verification tools for non-linear ordinary differential equations along with a neural network reachability tool suffers from severe overestimation errors [5]. Still, the verification of closed loop neural network systems is deeply important as they naturally arise in safety critical systems [5] such as autonomous vehicles, and complex control systems that make use of model predictive control and reinforcement learning [16]. Thus, there is a compelling need for methods and advanced software tools that can effectively deal with the complexities exhibited by these systems [5]. Inspired by a shortage of verification methods for closed-loop neural network control systems in the research literature, the central contribution of this paper is the provision of a set of executable benchmarks that have been synthesized using methods such as reinforcement learning [17], and model predictive control [14]. The problems elucidated in the paper are modeled using Simulink/Stateflow (SLSF) and are available at the following github repository1. We aim to provide a thorough problem description to which the numerous tools and approaches for non-linear systems and neural network verification present in the research community can be evaluated and compared [22]. If the research community is able to devise acceptable solutions to the aformentioned challenges they will stimulate the development of robust and intelligent systems with the potential to bring unparalleled benefits to numerous application domains. 2 Description of benchmarks.

Instead, it often involves a systematic deduction by ruling out other possible outcomes as a self-checking mechanism. In this paper, we describe the design of a hybrid neural network for logical learning that is similar to the human reasoning through the introduction of an auxiliary input, namely the indicators, that act as the hints to suggest logical outcomes. We generate these indicators by digging into the hidden information buried underneath the original training data for direct or indirect suggestions. We used the MNIST data to demonstrate the design and use of these indicators in a convolutional neural network. We trained a series of such hybrid neural networks with variations of the indicators. Our results show that these hybrid neural networks are very robust in generating logical outcomes with inherently higher prediction accuracy than the direct use of the original input and output in apparent models. Such improved predictability with reassured logical confidence is obtained through the exhaustion of all possible indicators to rule out all illogical outcomes, which is not available in the apparent models. Our logical learning process can effectively cope with the unknown unknowns using a full exploitation of all existing knowledge available for learning. The design and implementation of the hints, namely the indicators, become an essential part of artificial intelligence for logical learning. We also introduce an ongoing application setup for this hybrid neural network in an autonomous grasping robot, namely as_DeepClaw, aiming at learning an optimized grasping pose through logical learning.","",""

As causal reasoning has an instinct for modeling distribution change, we propose to incorporate causality into mitigating adversarial vulnerability. However, causal formulations of the intuition of adversarial attack and the development of robust DNNs are still lacking in the literature. To bridge this gap, we construct a causal graph to model the generation process of adversarial examples and define the adversarial distribution to formalize the intuition of adversarial attacks. From a causal perspective, we find that the label is spuriously correlated with the style (content-independent) information when an instance is given. The spurious correlation implies that the adversarial distribution is constructed via making the statistical conditional association between style information and labels drastically different from that in natural distribution. Thus, DNNs that fit the spurious correlation are vulnerable to the adversarial distribution. Inspired by the observation, we propose the adversarial distribution alignment method to eliminate the difference between the natural distribution and the adversarial distribution. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method. Our method can be seen as the first attempt to leverage causality for mitigating adversarial vulnerability.","",""

The origin of this variability is uncertain, but it is usually interpreted as detrimental noise that reduces the computational accuracy of neural circuits. Here we investigate the possibility that such response variability might in fact be beneficial, because it may partially compensate for a decrease in accuracy due to stochastic changes in the synaptic strengths of a network. We study the interplay between two kinds of noise, response (or neuronal) noise and synaptic noise, by analyzing their joint influence on the accuracy of neural networks trained to perform various tasks. We find an interesting, generic interaction: when fluctuations in the synaptic connections are proportional to their strengths (multiplicative noise), a certain amount of response noise in the input neurons can significantly improve network performance, compared to the same network without response noise. Performance is enhanced because response noise and multiplicative synaptic noise are in some ways equivalent. So if the algorithm used to find the optimal synaptic weights can take into account the variability of the model neurons, it can also take into account the variability of the synapses. Thus, the connection patterns generated with response noise are typically more resistant to synaptic degradation than those obtained without response noise. As a consequence of this interplay, if multiplicative synaptic noise is present, it is better to have response noise in the network than not to have it. These results are demonstrated analytically for the most basic network consisting of two input neurons and one output neuron performing a simple classification task, but computer simulations show that the phenomenon persists in a wide range of architectures, including recurrent (attractor) networks and sensorimotor networks that perform coordinate transformations. The results suggest that response variability could play an important dynamic role in networks that continuously learn.","",""

We perform extensive policy transfer experiments in simulation for two representative manipulation tasks: block stacking and crate opening. Our policies are shown to be more robust to domain shifts, more sample efficient to learn, and scale to more complex settings with larger state spaces.

Moreover, a fuzzy-neural-network inherited SMC (FNNISMC) scheme is proposed to relax the requirement of detailed system information and deal with chattering control efforts in the SMC system. In the FNNISMC strategy, the FNN framework is designed to mimic the SMC law, and adaptive tuning algorithms for network parameters are derived in the sense of projection algorithm and Lyapunov stability theorem to ensure the network convergence as well as stable control performance. Numerical simulations and experimental results of a two-link robot manipulator actuated by DC servo motors are provided to justify the claims of the proposed FNNISMC system, and the superiority of the proposed FNNISMC scheme is also evaluated by quantitative comparison with previous intelligent control schemes.","",""

Syllogistic fuzzy reasoning, where the consequence of a rule in one reasoning stage is passed to the next stage as a fact, is essential to effectively build up a large scale system with high level intelligence.

Several proof of concept demonstrations have shown encouraging results, but barriers to clinical translation still remain. In particular, intracortical prostheses must satisfy stringent power dissipation constraints so as not to damage cortex.   APPROACH One possible solution is to use ultra-low power neuromorphic chips to decode neural signals for these intracortical implants. The first step is to explore in simulation the feasibility of translating decoding algorithms for brain-machine interface (BMI) applications into spiking neural networks (SNNs).   MAIN RESULTS Here we demonstrate the validity of the approach by implementing an existing Kalman-filter-based decoder in a simulated SNN using the Neural Engineering Framework (NEF), a general method for mapping control algorithms onto SNNs. To measure this system's robustness and generalization, we tested it online in closed-loop BMI experiments with two rhesus monkeys. Across both monkeys, a Kalman filter implemented using a 2000-neuron SNN has comparable performance to that of a Kalman filter implemented using standard floating point techniques.   SIGNIFICANCE These results demonstrate the tractability of SNN implementations of statistical signal processing algorithms on different monkeys and for several tasks, suggesting that a SNN decoder, implemented on a neuromorphic chip, may be a feasible computational platform for low-power fully-implanted prostheses.

We show the model is able to continuously learn a large number of variable order temporal sequences using an unsupervised Hebbian-like learning rule. The sparse temporal codes formed by the model can robustly handle branching temporal sequences by maintaining multiple predictions until there is sufficient disambiguating evidence. We compare the HTM sequence memory with other sequence learning algorithms, including statistical methods—autoregressive integrated moving average; feedforward neural networks—time delay neural network and online sequential extreme learning machine; and recurrent neural networks—long short-term memory and echo-state networks on sequence prediction problems with both artificial and real-world data. The HTM model achieves comparable accuracy to other state-of-the-art algorithms. The model also exhibits properties that are critical for sequence learning, including continuous online learning, the ability to handle multiple predictions and branching sequences with high-order statistics, robustness to sensor noise and fault tolerance, and good performance without task-specific hyperparameter tuning.

Nevertheless, how to comprehensively leverage these relations within a unified network architecture is still a challenging problem. In this paper, we present a novel network structure called Hybrid Graph Neural Network (HyGnn) which targets to relieve the problem by interweaving the multi-scale features for crowd density as well as its auxiliary task (localization) together and performing joint reasoning over a graph. Specifically, HyGnn integrates a hybrid graph to jointly represent the task-specific feature maps of different scales as nodes, and two types of relations as edges: (i) multi-scale relations capturing the feature dependencies across scales and (ii) mutual beneficial relations building bridges for the cooperation between counting and localization. Thus, through message passing, HyGnn can capture and distill richer relations between nodes to obtain more powerful representations, providing robust and accurate results. Our HyGnn performs significantly well on four challenging datasets: ShanghaiTech Part A, ShanghaiTech Part B, UCF_CC_50 and UCF_QNRF, outperforming the state-of-the-art algorithms by a large margin.","",""

Given a globally exponentially stable neural network, the problem to be addressed here is how much time delay and noise the RNN can withstand to be globally exponentially stable in the presence of delay and noise. The upper bounds of the time delay and noise intensity are characterized by using transcendental equations for the RNNs to sustain global exponential stability. Moreover, we prove theoretically that, for any globally exponentially stable RNNs, if additive noises and time delays are smaller than the derived lower bounds arrived at here, then the perturbed RNNs are guaranteed to also be globally exponentially stable.

A main issue of an autonomous mobile robot is the design of an intelligent controller which enables the robot to navigate in a real world environment and avoiding obstacles especially in crowded and changing environment. Study Design: The controller uses genetic, fuzzy and neural to control of mobile robot. Place and Duration of Study: College Science, computer department, between September 2011 and December 2012. Methodology: In this search, fuzzy logic, genetic algorithm, and neural network (soft computing) are used to design an intelligent controller. This is due to the fact that fuzzy if-then rules are well suited for capturing the imprecise nature of human knowledge and reasoning processes. On the other hand, the neural networks are equipped for learning. Genetic algorithm has active role in the generating of fuzzy rules, it is designed to minimize the number of rules to minimum number. It is also helped to improve membership functions. Neural network is trained by using back propagation to increase efficiency of the work in time of arrive and get the shortest path to goal, it is obtained the steer angle of robot to the appropriate direction (avoid obstacles or get target). Results: The efficiency and robust of this work is appeared by using many different unknown environments that have different numbers, sizes and shapes of obstacles. The controller enables robot to avoid obstacles and reach goal with shortest distance (757 pixels) compared with other techniques(fuzzy controller and neuro-fuzzy controller),which owns the largest distance from same start position to the same end position and also less time(14 seconds).

In this work, we revisit this approach and investigate if we can leverage other reinforcement learning approaches to improve learning. We first formalize training a neural network as a finite-horizon reinforcement learning problem and discuss how this facilitates using ideas from reinforcement learning like off-policy learning. We show that the standard on-policy REINFORCE approach, even with a variety of variance reduction approaches, learns suboptimal solutions. We introduce an off-policy approach, to facilitate reasoning about the greedy action for other agents and help overcome stochasticity in other agents.

Instead of a single level PI, wind power forecast uncertainties are represented in a list of PIs. These PIs are then decomposed into quantiles of wind power. A new scenario generation method is proposed to handle wind power forecast uncertainties. For each hour, an empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) is fitted to these quantile points. The Monte Carlo simulation method is used to generate scenarios from the ECDF. Then the wind power scenarios are incorporated into a stochastic security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) model. The heuristic genetic algorithm is utilized to solve the stochastic SCUC problem. Five deterministic and four stochastic case studies incorporated with interval forecasts of wind power are implemented. The results of these cases are presented and discussed together.
