The robustness of AI algorithms is of great interest as inaccurate prediction could result in safety concerns and limit the adoption of AI systems. In this paper, we propose a framework based on design of experiments to systematically investigate the robustness of AI classification algorithms. A robust classification algorithm is expected to have high accuracy and low variability under different application scenarios. The robustness can be affected by a wide range of factors such as the imbalance of class labels in the training dataset, the chosen prediction algorithm, the chosen dataset of the application, and a change of distribution in the training and test datasets. To investigate the robustness of AI classification algorithms, we conduct a comprehensive set of mixture experiments to collect prediction performance results. Then statistical analyses are conducted to understand how various factors affect the robustness of AI classification algorithms. We summarize our findings and provide suggestions to practitioners in AI applications.","",""

In this work, we present an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) framework based on an adaptive dimensional reduction which (i) outlines the most important clinical features for oncological patients’ profiling and (ii), based on these features, determines the profile, i.e., the cluster a patient belongs to. For these purposes, we collected a cohort of 267 breast cancer patients. The adopted dimensional reduction method determines the relevant subspace where distances among patients are used by a hierarchical clustering procedure to identify the corresponding optimal categories. Our results demonstrate how the molecular subtype is the most important feature for clustering. Then, we assessed the robustness of current therapies and guidelines; our findings show a striking correspondence between available patients’ profiles determined in an unsupervised way and either molecular subtypes or therapies chosen according to guidelines, which guarantees the interpretability characterizing explainable approaches to machine learning techniques.

In this work, we present a novel stochastic STDP algorithm that uses spiking frequency information to dynamically adjust synaptic behavior. The algorithm is tested in pattern recognition task with noisy input and shows accuracy improvement over deterministic STDP. In addition, we show that the new algorithm can be used for designing a robust ReRAM based SNN accelerator that has strong resilience to device variation.","",""

Robotic systems controlling is vital due to the wide range of application. Obviously stability and robustness are the most minimum requirements in control systems; even though the proof of stability and robustness is more important especially in the case of nonlinear systems.

To validate the electromechanical and software approach, the authors present results verified experimentally in different environments (in‐ and outdoor) with differing walking speeds on various substrates and in varying inclinations from −20∘ to 20°. The results show that the presented approach is viable and improves the flexibility of the locomotor system. A hominid design was chosen in order to perform various types of locomotion. To demonstrate the entire functionality of the developed hardware, two different motion modes (quadrupedal and bipedal locomotion) are investigated. This also includes a stable transition from a four‐legged posture to an upright posture and vice versa.","",""

The present paper addresses this problem while concerning the integration of intermittent wind power and load disturbance into the WIPS. With this intent, it proposes the compensated superconducting magnetic energy storage (CSMES) system with proportional integral derivative (PID) controller for improving the frequency and power deviation profile. A novel swarm intelligence-based artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is used for optimal design of PID-CSMES system. Robustness of the proposed ABC-based PID-CSMES control strategy is tested in WIPS under various disturbance patterns of load and wind power. To demonstrate the improved dynamic response, their simulation results are compared with particle swarm optimization-based PID-CSMES, PID with SMES, and only PID controller technique. The performance indices and transient response characteristics of frequency and power deviation are used to evaluate and compare the accuracy and efficiency of each controller. Stability of various system configurations is analyzed using eigenvalue location. Comparing the results of different controller in WIPS indicates a substantial improvement in the dynamic response of system frequency and power deviations by utilizing the proposed control strategy.","",""

More specifically, we are interested in addressing robustness problems in trust and reputation systems so that buying agents are able to accurately model the reputation of selling agents even with the existence of various unfair rating attacks from other dishonest buyers (called advisors) [Zhang and Cohen, 2008]. In multiagent-based e-marketplaces, trust and reputation systems are designed for buyers to model seller reputation based on ratings shared by advisors. However, unfair rating attacks from dishonest advisors render trust and reputation systems ineffective to mislead buyers to transact with dishonest sellers [Josang, 2012]. Typical unfair rating attacks include Constant where dishonest advisors constantly provide unfairly positive/negative ratings to sellers; Camouflage where dishonest advisors camouflage themselves as honest advisors by providing fair ratings to build up their trustworthiness first and then gives unfair ratings; Whitewashing where a dishonest advisor is able to whitewash its low trustworthiness by starting a new account with the initial trustworthiness value; Sybil where a dishonest buyer creates several accounts to constantly provide unfair ratings to sellers; Sybil Camouflage (the combination of Sybil and Camouflage) where a number of dishonest advisors perform Camouflage attacks together; and Sybil Whitewashing where a number of dishonest advisors perform Whitewashing attacks together. The challenge is thus how to design robust trust models to against various strategic attacks. Various trust models [Zhang and Cohen, 2008; Josang, 2012] have been proposed to cope with unfair ratings. However, these models are not completely robust against various attacks. In particular, when dishonest advisors occupy a large proportion in e-marketplaces (i.e., Sybil), BRS becomes inefficient and iCLUB is unstable because they both employ the “majority-rule”. When dishonest advisors adopt strategic attacks, TRAVOS does not work well because it assumes an advisors’ rating behavior is consistent. ReferralChain assigns trust value 1 to every new buyer (advisor) which provides a chance for dishonest advisors to abuse the initial trust (i.e., Whitewashing). Personalized is vulnerable when buyers have insufficient experience with advisors and the majority of advisors are dishonest (i.e., combination of Whitewashing and Sybil).

Software Defined Networking (SDN), being centralized by design, offers a global overview of the network. Robustness and adaptability are part of a package offered by programmable networking, which drove us to consider the integration between both AI and SDN. The general goal of our series is to achieve an Artificial Intelligence Resiliency System (ARS). The aim of this paper is to propose a new AI-based consistency verification system, which will be part of ARS in our future work. The comparison of different deep learning architectures shows that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) give the best results with an accuracy of 99.39% on our dataset and 96% on our consistency test scenario.","",""

Thus, enhancing the synthesis quality for QDI design is a justifiable effort, especially in rising application fields, such as the Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence. This work proposes Pulsar, a method based on the extension of SDDS-NCL, a previously proposed asynchronous QDI template and design flow. Pulsar brings four original contributions: (i) two new models for components used to as sequential barriers; (ii) a new model for half buffer pipelines, half-buffer channel network (HBCN); (iii) a linear programming formulation to define a circuit cycle time constraint; (iv) a design flow that enables automating the process to design sequential SDDS-NCL circuits.

The foundation steps of feature map construction for the region-based attention model are proposed here. The color contrast map is generated based upon the extended findings from the color theory, the symmetry map is constructed using a novel scanning-based method, and a new algorithm is proposed to compute a size contrast map as a formal feature channel. Eccentricity and orientation are computed using the moments of obtained regions and then saliency is evaluated using the rarity criteria. The efficient design of the proposed algorithms allows incorporating five feature channels while maintaining a processing rate of multiple frames per second. Another salient advantage over the existing techniques is the reusability of the salient regions in the high-level machine vision procedures due to preservation of their shapes and precise locations.

Some experiments on this research line show that the controller gain is only a function of the overshoot observed in the setpoint experiment.

The motivation of this work is to use sociological notions and theories of ’organisation’ to blueprint more robust multiagent systems. Based on an analysis of the DAI literature, we give a precise and empirically verifiable definition of robustness, which we call τ-robustness. This notion consists of (i) the definition of a performance measure, (ii) the definition of a perturbation against which the performance measure is evaluated, and (iii) a threshold τ , which marks the maximally allowed deviation of the performance measure to call the tested system τ-robust. The main theoretic contribution of this thesis is a framework of design parameters for robust multiagent organisation based on a sociological notion of organisation. This framework, called the Framework for selfOrganisation and Robustness in Multiagent systems (FORM), can be applied to multiagent organisation using the concept of holonic multiagent systems, for which a new, extended definition is presented. By freely combining all possible values of the parameters in the framework, it allows to model more than 90 000 different forms of multiagent organisation. Furthermore, we discuss how the holonic design parameters relate to different dimensions of the autonomy of the participating agents. This discussion shows that, and how, the notion of self-organisation is connected to the notion of adjustable autonomy. As the notion of autonomy is central to the definition of an agent, this constitutes an important contribution to the general theory of multiagent systems. In order to make the large design space spanned by FORM concrete, we chose to model a subset of the possible organisational forms. This choice is based on a sociological analysis of organisations in today’s economy and makes a diverse use of the available values for the design parameters. The modelled forms of organisation are arranged on a spectrum of autonomy ranging from fully autonomous agents to more and more coupled agents, until we reach an organisational form where the boundaries between individual agents dissolve and only one single agent remains. This spectrum can be used to devise a mechanism for self-organisation in the sense that agents start to organise in a loosely coupled holon and increase the 1 Collaborative research group in Socionics.","",""

The key idea is to implement all key components of a deep learning CNN, including multi-dimensional convolution, activation, and pooling layers, completely in the probabilistic computing domain in order to achieve high computing robustness, high performance, and low hardware usage. Our approach has three advantages. First, it can achieve significantly lower algorithmic complexity for any given accuracy requirement.

Second, this proposed stochastic-based architecture is highly fault-tolerant because the information to be processed is encoded with a large ensemble of random samples. As such, the local perturbations of its computing accuracy will be dissipated globally, thus becoming inconsequential to the final overall results. More interestingly, our measured results have shown that 0.1 percent degradation in computing accuracy of CNN can actually mitigate the well-known overfitting problem. Overall, being highly scalable and energy efficient, our stochastic-based convolutional neural network architecture is well-suited for a modular vision engine with the goal of performing real-time detection, recognition, and segmentation of mega-pixel images, especially those perception-based computing tasks that are inherently fault-tolerant, while still requiring high energy efficiency.","",""

Their unique ability to search for complete and global solutions to a given problem makes EAs a powerful problem solving tool which combine such important characteristics as robustness, versatility and simplicity. Historically, there exist several branches of EAs, namely Genetic Algorithms, Genetic Programming, Evolutionary Programming and Evolutionary Strategies. Their development started independently in the 1960s and 70s. Nevertheless, all of them are based on the same fundamental principle evolution. ‘Evolution’ is used here in its Darwinian sense, the advance through ‘survival of the fittest’. Despite of a remarkable simplicity, EAs have proven to be capable of solving many practical tasks. The first and obvious application is numerical optimisation (minimisation or maximisation) of a given function. However, EAs are capable of much more than function optimisation or estimation of a series of unknown parameters within a given model of a physical system. Due to, in a large part, their stochastic nature, EAs can create such complex structures as computer programs, architectural designs and neural networks. Several applications of EAs have been known to produce a patentable invention (Koza et al., 1996, Koza et al., 1999 and Koza et al., 2003). Unfortunately, such a truly intelligent application of EAs is rarely used for practical purposes. GP and similar algorithms often require a supercomputing power to produce an optimal solution for a practical task. This may be overcome, at least partially, by narrowing the search space. A general engineering design practice is to propose a new design based on existing knowledge of various techniques (not uncommonly even from other fields) and no less important, intuition. Following this, the proposal is analysed, tried on a real system or its mathematical model, findings and errors are analysed again, the design is modified (or rejected) and the process continues until a satisfactory solution is found. EAs work basically on the same principle, although, obviously, using less analytical analysis but more trial-and-error approach. It was found, however, that the process of selecting the most suitable solutions at each stage and producing the next iteration variants is, overall, largely intelligent and heuristic. EAs are capable to answer not only the question how to do something (how to control, in particular), but also the question what to do in order to meet","",""

One area is robustness – our designs are created with the expectation that they will be made correctly and will be used appropriately. If either of these expectations turn out to be false, then the item will fail. Another area is adaptability – most of our designs are never intended to cope with unexpected circumstances, so if something unforeseen occurs then they fail. Yet another area is self-design – or rather, the lack of it. We really have little concept of our technology designing itself or building itself outside science fiction. And another area is efficiency – our designs are as efficient as we know how (or wish to) make them. They cannot become more efficient by learning the intrinsic properties of their constituents – indeed, typically it is those intrinsic properties that ultimately cause the technology to fail. They can't even feed themselves – if their power source is failing, they cannot find energy from their environments, even if they're standing next to a power socket or a gas pump. Natural designs may not be the result of conscious thought, but they are the result of a few billion years of experience.

However, the construction of such systems is highly complex and faces several challenges in terms of software engineering and artificial intelligence aspects.

That is, the AI system provides information to a human decision-maker, who has the final say.  However, for applications ranging from space exploration, to e-commerce, to search and rescue missions, there is an increasing need and desire for AI systems that display a much greater degree of autonomy. In designing autonomous AI systems, or agents, issues concerning safety, reliability, and robustness become critical. Does the agent observe appropriate safety constraints? Can we provide performance or goal-achievement guarantees? Does the agent deliberate and/or learn efficiently and in real time?  In this dissertation, we address some of these issues by developing an approach to agent design that integrates control-theoretic techniques, primarily methods based on Lyapunov functions, with planning and learning techniques from AI. Our main approach is to use control-theoretic domain knowledge to formulate, or restrict, the ways in which the agent can interact with its environment. This approach allows one to construct agents that enjoy provable safety and performance guarantees, and that reason and act in real-time or anytime fashion. Because the guarantees are established based on restrictions on the agent's behavior, specialized “safety-oriented” decision-making algorithms are not necessary. Agents can reason using standard AI algorithms; we discuss state-space search and reinforcement learning agents in detail. To a limited degree, we also show that the control-theoretic domain knowledge needed to ensure safe agent behavior can itself be learned by the agent, and need not be known a priori. We demonstrate our theory with simulation experiments on standard problems from robotics and control.","",""

Despite its age, Lisp is still a ""modern"" language that continues to adapt to encompass the newest ideas in programming (Steele 1984). Over the past 30 years, Lisp has remained the language of choice for designing and prototyping complex programs, particularly in symbolic processing and artificial intelligence applications. Lisp's vitality is rooted in its power to express robust designs for com­ putational systems. A design for a system is robust if small changes in the system requirements can be accomplished by small changes in the design. One way to enhance the robustness of a design is to express it in terms of a natural representation of the problem domain, where each relevant entity in the problem domain is modeled by a computational entity and each relation or operation in the problem domain is modeled by a computational relation or function. With such an organization, small changes in the configuration of the problem domain can be accommodated by small changes in the configuration of the computational model. For a programming language to support such natural representations, it must allow programmers the freedom to construct appropriate com­ putational abstractions to represent the elements of problem domains.

Here, tailoring ligand chemistry can alter preferred spin or oxidation states as well as electronic structure properties and reactivity, creating vast regions of chemical space to explore when designing new materials atom by atom. Although first-principles density functional theory (DFT) remains the workhorse of computational chemistry in mechanism deduction and property prediction, it is of limited use here. DFT is both far too computationally costly for widespread exploration of transition-metal chemical space and also prone to inaccuracies that limit its predictive performance for localized d electrons in transition-metal complexes. These challenges starkly contrast with the well-trodden regions of small-organic-molecule chemical space, where the analytical forms of molecular mechanics force fields and semiempirical theories have for decades accelerated the discovery of new molecules, accurate DFT functional performance has been demonstrated, and gold-standard methods from correlated wavefunction theory can predict experimental results to chemical accuracy.The combined promise of transition-metal chemical space exploration and lack of established tools has mandated a distinct approach. In this Account, we outline the path we charted in exploration of transition-metal chemical space starting from the first machine learning (ML) models (i.e., artificial neural network and kernel ridge regression) and representations for the prediction of open-shell transition-metal complex properties. The distinct importance of the immediate coordination environment of the metal center as well as the lack of low-level methods to accurately predict structural properties in this coordination environment first motivated and then benefited from these ML models and representations. Once developed, the recipe for prediction of geometric, spin state, and redox potential properties was straightforwardly extended to a diverse range of other properties, including in catalysis, computational ""feasibility"", and the gas separation properties of periodic metal-organic frameworks. Interpretation of selected features most important for model prediction revealed new ways to encapsulate design rules and confirmed that models were robustly mapping essential structure-property relationships. Encountering the special challenge of ensuring that good model performance could generalize to new discovery targets motivated investigation of how to best carry out model uncertainty quantification. Distance-based approaches, whether in model latent space or in carefully engineered feature space, provided intuitive measures of the domain of applicability. With all of these pieces together, ML can be harnessed as an engine to tackle the large-scale exploration of transition-metal chemical space needed to satisfy multiple objectives using efficient global optimization methods. In practical terms, bringing these artificial intelligence tools to bear on the problems of transition-metal chemical space exploration has resulted in ML-model assessments of large, multimillion compound spaces in minutes and validated new design leads in weeks instead of decades.","",""

Based on our study, the AI receiver can estimate time-varying channels with a single training phase.

As harvesters and other power sources which provide energy autonomy inevitably have power variations, the circuits need to robustly operate over a dynamic power envelope.

In this paper, we propose a novel NN design approach using the principle of pulse width modulation (PWM). PWM signals represent information with their duty cycle values which may be made independent of the voltages and frequencies of the carrier signals. We design a PWM-based perceptron which can serve as the fundamental building block for NNs, by using an entirely new method of realizing arithmetic in the PWM domain. We analyse the proposed approach building from a 3 × 3 perceptron circuit to a complex multi-layer NN.

These include a variety of sensitive applications such as healthcare, finance, autonomous driving, criminal justice, and others which all pose significant concerns for fairness, robustness, safety, and trustworthiness. Despite these applications to critical tasks, deep networks are infamously referred to as black-box models because of their total lack of transparency in decision-making. If we are able to gain insight into how a model is coming to its conclusions, we are able to more clearly assess the trustworthiness and validity of its decisions. Consequently, an abundance of ongoing research is attempting to address model interpretability as the key problem to resolving these issues. There are many methods which are currently used to provide explanations of complex model predictions. LIME (Ribeiro et al., 2016) fits a local linear model around a data point, showing which features positively and negatively influence the prediction results. Despite the overall model being nonlinear, the local model gets an interpretable picture of how the model looks at small scales around the data point. Extensions of this method use other interpretable models like small decision tress. Shapley Values and SHAP follows a similar idea to assign a score to each feature, using a gametheoretic formulation which treats each feature as a player causing the final prediction (Lundberg and Lee, 2017). Its more rigorous formulation yields guarantees of its explanations summing up to the prediction score, but practically it usually must be estimated because of its high computational cost. Shuffle-based feature importance permutes the data of each feature to ascertain its importance in the final prediction in comparison to its normal prediction (Fisher et al., 2018). IG uses the fundamental theorem of calculus to provide additive explanations of a prediction (Sundararajan et al., 2017). This method is very popular in computer vision where its computational efficiency and saliency are prized, even though other work has exposed some of its shortcomings in providing an interpretation (Adebayo et al., 2018). Other methods are specifically designed for computer vision like TCAV (Kim et al., 2018) which finds a ‘concept direction’ corresponding to a large sample of concept images from the user. Surprisingly, all of these most popular interpretability methods share the same one limitation. None of these methods consider the shared importance of groups of two or more features; they only look at the effects had by each of the features individually. A feature interaction between two variables broadly describes a situation where both of the features/ variables are simultaneously important for a model’s prediction. In text applications for sentiment, ”not good” is a very simple example of two words strongly interacting with one another to create a negative sentiment. In modern-day applications, neural networks are usually hailed as amazing function approximators exactly because of their incredible ability to automatically uncover these kinds of complex relationships between the variables of the dataset.

Two quaternary coding electrodes are configured, and their outputs are normalized with respect to a reference electrode, leading to highly stable detection that is not affected by the ambient parameters and operation manners.

One extensively used method to minimize the cost and time for the drug development process is computer-aided drug design (CADD). CADD allows better focusing on experiments, which can reduce the time and cost involved in researching new drugs. In this context, structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) is robust and useful and is one of the most promising in silico techniques for drug design. SBVS attempts to predict the best interaction mode between two molecules to form a stable complex, and it uses scoring functions to estimate the force of non-covalent interactions between a ligand and molecular target. Thus, scoring functions are the main reason for the success or failure of SBVS software. Many software programs are used to perform SBVS, and since they use different algorithms, it is possible to obtain different results from different software using the same input. In the last decade, a new technique of SBVS called consensus virtual screening (CVS) has been used in some studies to increase the accuracy of SBVS and to reduce the false positives obtained in these experiments. An indispensable condition to be able to utilize SBVS is the availability of a 3D structure of the target protein. Some virtual databases, such as the Protein Data Bank, have been created to store the 3D structures of molecules. However, sometimes it is not possible to experimentally obtain the 3D structure. In this situation, the homology modeling methodology allows the prediction of the 3D structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence. This review presents an overview of the challenges involved in the use of CADD to perform SBVS, the areas where CADD tools support SBVS, a comparison between the most commonly used tools, and the techniques currently used in an attempt to reduce the time and cost in the drug development process. Finally, the final considerations demonstrate the importance of using SBVS in the drug development process.","",""

This paper describes the processes and methods that will be used to develop an extension to the TRIPOD statement (TRIPOD-artificial intelligence, AI) and the PROBAST (PROBAST-AI) tool for prediction model studies that applied machine learning techniques. Methods and analysis TRIPOD-AI and PROBAST-AI will be developed following published guidance from the EQUATOR Network, and will comprise five stages. Stage 1 will comprise two systematic reviews (across all medical fields and specifically in oncology) to examine the quality of reporting in published machine-learning-based prediction model studies. In stage 2, we will consult a diverse group of key stakeholders using a Delphi process to identify items to be considered for inclusion in TRIPOD-AI and PROBAST-AI. Stage 3 will be virtual consensus meetings to consolidate and prioritise key items to be included in TRIPOD-AI and PROBAST-AI. Stage 4 will involve developing the TRIPOD-AI checklist and the PROBAST-AI tool, and writing the accompanying explanation and elaboration papers. In the final stage, stage 5, we will disseminate TRIPOD-AI and PROBAST-AI via journals, conferences, blogs, websites (including TRIPOD, PROBAST and EQUATOR Network) and social media. TRIPOD-AI will provide researchers working on prediction model studies based on machine learning with a reporting guideline that can help them report key details that readers need to evaluate the study quality and interpret its findings, potentially reducing research waste. We anticipate PROBAST-AI will help researchers, clinicians, systematic reviewers and policymakers critically appraise the design, conduct and analysis of machine learning based prediction model studies, with a robust standardised tool for bias evaluation.

Usually AC loss is calculated for pure sinusoidal current, while it is no longer accurate when current is nonsinusoidal. On the other hand, efficiency of cooling system in large scale power devices is dependent on accurate estimation and prediction of the heat load caused by AC loss in design stage. Therefore, estimation of nonsinusoidal AC loss of high temperature superconducting (HTS) material would be of great interest for designers of large-scale superconducting devices. In this paper, at first nonsinusoidal AC loss of a typical HTS tape was calculated under distorted currents using H-formulation finite element method. Then, a range of artificial intelligence (AI) models were implemented to predict AC loss of a typical HTS tape. In order to find the best and more adaptive AI model for nonsinusoidal AC loss prediction, different regression models are evaluated using Support Vector Machine regression model, Generalized Linear regression model, Decision Tree regression model, Feed Forward Neural Network based model, Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System based model, and Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) based model. In order to evaluate robustness of developed models cross-validation technique is implemented on experimental data. To compare the performance of different AI models, four prediction measures were used: Theil’s U coefficients (U_Accuracy and U_Quality), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Regression value (R-value). Obtained results show that best performance belongs to RBFNN based model and then ANFIS based model. U coefficients and RMSE values are obtained less than 0.005 and R-Value is become close to one by using RBFNN based model for testing data, which indicates high accuracy prediction performance.","",""

However, these technologies will not replace the fundamental components of the health system, such as ethical leadership and governance, or avoid the need for a robust ethical and regulatory environment. In this paper, we discuss what a robust ethical and regulatory environment might look like for big data analytics in health insurance, and describe examples of safeguards and participatory mechanisms that should be established. First, a clear and effective data governance framework is critical. Legal standards need to be enacted and insurers should be encouraged and given incentives to adopt a human-centred approach in the design and use of big data analytics and artificial intelligence. Second, a clear and accountable process is necessary to explain what information can be used and how it can be used. Third, people whose data may be used should be empowered through their active involvement in determining how their personal data may be managed and governed. Fourth, insurers and governance bodies, including regulators and policy-makers, need to work together to ensure that the big data analytics based on artificial intelligence that are developed are transparent and accurate. Unless an enabling ethical environment is in place, the use of such analytics will likely contribute to the proliferation of unconnected data systems, worsen existing inequalities, and erode trustworthiness and trust.","",""

Particularly, we show that the use of robust deep sampling methodologies of the altered genetics serves to obtain meaningful results and dramatically decreases the cost of research and development in drug design, influencing very positively the use of precision medicine and the outcomes in patients. The target-centric approach and the use of strong prior hypotheses that are not matched against reality (disease genetic data) are undoubtedly the cause of the high number of drug design failures and attrition rates.

Survey data was gathered from 109 employees who had not, at the time of the research, used the new technology.   Findings The introduction of AI considerably improved the speed and efficiency of the work processes. The research found that those employees who had used the new technology were positive about its effects, indicating that it was easy to use, robust and highly productive. A proportion of employees who had not, at the time of the research, used the new system, were less sure that it would improve their ability to do their job. Implications for introducing such a system and for employee training are discussed.   Research limitations/implications This is a relatively small sample in one organisation; further research should be undertaken to assess whether these findings apply more widely.   Practical implications If these attitudes are found elsewhere, there are a number of simple, practical suggestions for how to introduce AI into similar work processes.

These oxidized lipids work as agonists, making TRPA1 a key player in inflammatory and neuropathic pain. TRPA1 antagonists acting as non-central pain blockers are a promising choice for future treatment of pain-related conditions having advantages over current therapeutic choices A large variety of in silico methods have been used in drug design to speed up the development of new active compounds such as molecular docking, quantitative structure-activity relationship models (QSAR), and machine learning classification algorithms. Artificial intelligence methods can significantly improve the drug discovery process and it is an attractive field that can bring together computer scientists and experts in drug development. In our paper, we aimed to develop three machine learning algorithms frequently used in drug discovery research: feedforward neural networks (FFNN), random forests (RF), and support vector machines (SVM), for discovering novel TRPA1 antagonists. All three machine learning methods used the same class of independent variables (multilevel neighborhoods of atoms descriptors) as prediction of activity spectra for substances (PASS) software. The model with the highest accuracy and most optimal performance metrics was the random forest algorithm, showing 99% accuracy and 0.9936 ROC AUC. Thus, our study emphasized that simpler and robust machine learning algorithms such as random forests perform better in correctly classifying TRPA1 antagonists since the dimension of the dependent variables dataset is relatively modest.","",""

These regimens were primarily relying on mechanism-of-action based selection of drugs, many of which have yielded positive in vitro but largely negative clinical outcomes. To overcome this challenge, we report the use of IDentif.AI, a platform that rapidly optimizes infectious disease (ID) combination therapy design using artificial intelligence (AI). In this study, IDentif.AI was implemented on a 12-drug candidate therapy search set representing over 530,000 possible drug combinations. IDentif.AI demonstrated that the optimal combination therapy against SARS-CoV-2 was comprised of remdesivir, ritonavir, and lopinavir, which mediated a 6.5-fold improvement in efficacy over remdesivir alone. Additionally, IDentif.AI showed hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin to be relatively ineffective. The identification of a clinically actionable optimal drug combination was completed within two weeks, with a 3-order of magnitude reduction in the number of tests typically needed. IDentif.AI analysis was also able to independently confirm clinical trial outcomes to date without requiring any data from these trials. The robustness of the IDentif.AI platform suggests that it may be applicable towards rapid development of optimal drug regimens to address current and future outbreaks.","",""

This four-year interdisciplinary research project seeks to gain a deeper understanding of the challenges and opportunities that artificial intelligence (AI) entails for facilitating migrant employment integration and workplace inclusion. We address the following research questions: 1. How is AI used by migrants, their co-workers and the actors involved in their employment integration process? 2.

A combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods (interviews, focus groups, shadowing and interactive workshops) is used.

Apart from contributing to theorizing migrant integration and AI, we also aim at providing a robust evidence-base for ‘good’ policy-making, regulatory guidelines and administration of profession-oriented integration process. Finally, we want to contribute to better understanding of how AI can contribute to overcoming prejudice and discrimination, which, in turn, can lead to mutual learning and building sustainable, welcoming and secure communities.","",""

Computing and understanding the properties of such sites is therefore a crucial component of the rational materials design process. Because of complex electronic effects at the atomic level, atomic site properties are conventionally derived from computationally expensive first-principle calculations, as this level of theory is required to achieve relevant accuracy. In this study, we present a widely applicable machine learning (ML) approach to compute atomic site properties with high accuracy in real time. The approach works well for complex non-crystalline atomic structures and therefore opens up the possibility for high-throughput screenings of nano-materials, amorphous systems and materials interfaces. Our approach includes a robust featurization scheme to transform atomic structures into features which can be used by common machine learning models. Performing a genetic algorithm (GA) based feature selection, we show how to establish an intuitive physical interpretation of the structure-property relations implied by the ML models. With this approach, we compute atomic site stabilities of metal nanoparticles ranging from 3-55 atoms with mean absolute errors in the range of 0.11-0.14 eV in real time. We also establish the chemical identity of the site as most important factor in determining atomic site stabilities, followed by structural features like bond distances and angles. Both, the featurization and GA feature selection functionality are published in open-source python modules. With this method, we enable the efficient rational design of highly specialized real-world nano-catalysts through data-driven materials screening.","",""
