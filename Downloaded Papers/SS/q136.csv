Although deep neural networks (DNN) have shown remarkable successes in many tasks, they are also criticized for the lack of interpretability and transparency. Interpreting a shared DNN model faces two additional challenges compared with interpreting a general model. (1) Limited training data can be disclosed to users. (2) The internal structure of the models may not be available. These two challenges impede the application of most existing interpretability approaches, such as saliency maps or influence functions, for DNN models. Case-based reasoning methods have been used for interpreting decisions; however, how to select and organize the data points under the constraints of shared DNN models is not discussed. Moreover, simply providing cases as explanations may not be sufficient for supporting instance level interpretability. Meanwhile, existing interpretation methods for DNN models generally lack the means to evaluate the reliability of the interpretation. In this article, we propose a framework named Shared Model INTerpreter (SMINT) to address the above limitations. We propose a new data structure called a boundary graph to organize training points to mimic the predictions of DNN models. We integrate local features, such as saliency maps and interpretable input masks, into the data structure to help users to infer the model decision boundaries. We show that the boundary graph is able to address the reliability issues in many local interpretation methods. We further design an algorithm named hidden-layer aware p-test to measure the reliability of the interpretations. Our experiments show that SMINT is able to achieve above 99% fidelity to corresponding DNN models on both MNIST and ImageNet by sharing only a tiny fraction of training data to make these models interpretable. The human pilot study demonstrates that SMINT provides better interpretability compared with existing methods. Moreover, we demonstrate that SMINT is able to assist model tuning for better performance on different user data.","",""

We develop a theoretical framework for adversarial training with FW optimization (FW-AT) that reveals a geometric connection between the loss landscape and the distortion of `∞ FW attacks (the attack’s `2 norm). Specifically, we show that high distortion of FW attacks is equivalent to low variation along the attack path. It is then experimentally demonstrated on various deep neural network architectures that `∞ attacks against robust models achieve near maximal `2 distortion. This mathematical transparency differentiates FW from the more popular Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) optimization. To demonstrate the utility of our theoretical framework we develop FW-Adapt, a novel adversarial training algorithm which uses simple distortion measure to adaptively change number of attack steps during training. FW-Adapt provides strong robustness at lower training times in comparison to PGD-AT for a variety of white-box and black-box attacks.","",""

The main purpose is to establish an adaptive actor-critic control method, so that the cost function in the procedure of dealing with uncertainty is minimum and the closed-loop system is stable. Based on the neural network approximator, an action network is applied to generate the optimal control signal and a critic network is used to approximate the cost function, respectively. In contrast to the previous methods, the main features of this paper are: 1) the ACD scheme is integrated into the controllers to cope with the uncertainty and 2) a novel cost function, which is not in quadric form, is proposed so that the total cost in the design procedure is reduced. It is proved that the optimal control signals and the tracking errors are uniformly ultimately bounded even when the uncertainty exists.

The aim of this work is to propose and validate a deep learning model to decode gait phases from Electroenchephalography (EEG).   APPROACH A Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) deep neural network has been trained to deal with time-dependent information within brain signals during locomotion. The EEG signals have been preprocessed by means of Artifacts Subspace Reconstruction (ASR) and Reliable Independent Component Analysis (RELICA) to ensure that classification performance was not affected by movement-related artifacts.   MAIN RESULT The network was evaluated on the dataset of 11 healthy subjects walking on a treadmill. The proposed decoding approach shows a robust reconstruction (AUC>90%) of gait patterns (i.e., swing and stance states) of both legs together, or of each leg independently.   SIGNIFICANCE Our results support for the first time the use of a memory-based deep learning classifier to decode walking activity from non-invasive brain recordings. We suggest that this classifier, exploited in real time, can be a more effective input for devices restoring locomotion in impaired people.","",""

In this paper, two learning techniques are independently introduced which use BL for improving robustness to white noise static and adversarial examples. The first method is bidirectional propagation of errors, which the error propagation occurs in backward and forward directions. Motivated by the fact that its generative model receives as input a constant vector per class, we introduce as a second method the novel hybrid adversarial networks (HAN).

To assess the performance of BL, we perform experiments using several architectures with fully and convolutional layers, with and without bias. Experimental results show that both methods improve robustness to white noise static and adversarial examples, and even increase accuracy, but have different behavior depending on the architecture and task, being more beneficial to use the one or the other.

In a BCI-aided epilepsy treatment system, therapic electrical stimulus is delivered in response to the prediction of upcoming seizure onsets, therefore timely and accurate seizure prediction algorithm plays an important role. However, unlike typical signatures such as slow or sharp waves in ictal periods, the signal patterns in preictal periods are usually subtle, and highly individual-dependent. How to extract effective and robust preictal features is still a challenging problem. Most recently, graph convolutional neural network (GCNN) has demonstrated the strength in the electroencephalogram (EEG) and intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) signal modeling, due to its advantages in describing complex relationships among different EEG/iEEG regions. However, current GCNN models are not suitable for seizure prediction. The effectiveness of GCNNs highly relies on prior graphs that describe the underlying relationships in EEG regions. However, due to the complex mechanism of seizure evolution, the underlying relationship in the preictal period can be diverse in different patients, making it almost impossible to build a proper prior graph in general. To deal with this problem, we propose a novel approach to automatically learn a patient-specific graph in a data-driven way, which is called the joint graph structure and representation learning network (JGRN). JGRN constructs a global-local graph convolutional neural network which jointly learns the graph structures and connection weights in a task-related learning process in iEEG signals, thus the learned graph and feature representations can be optimized toward the objective of seizure prediction. Experimental results show that our JGRN outperforms CNN and GCNN models remarkably, and the improvement is more obvious when preictal features are subtle.","",""

The characteristics of existing one-class labels lead to a dilemma: it is hard to directly use a multiple classifier based on deep neural networks to solve one-class classification problems. Therefore, in this article, we propose a novel DeepOC neural network, termed as DeepOC, which can simultaneously learn compact feature representations and train a DeepOC classifier. Only with the given normal samples, we use the stacked convolutional encoder to generate their low-dimensional high-level features and train a one-class classifier to make these features as compact as possible. Meanwhile, for the sake of the correct mapping relation and the feature representations’ diversity, we utilize a decoder in order to reconstruct raw samples from these low-dimensional feature representations. This structure is gradually established using an adversarial mechanism during the training stage. This mechanism is the key to our model. It organically combines two seemingly contradictory components and allows them to take advantage of each other, thus making the model robust and effective. Unlike methods that use handcrafted features or those that are separated into two stages (extracting features and training classifiers), DeepOC is a one-stage model using reliable features that are automatically extracted by neural networks. Experiments on various benchmark data sets show that DeepOC is feasible and achieves the state-of-the-art anomaly detection results compared with a dozen existing methods.","",""

However, various working requirements and the oceanic environment may cause some uncertain and unfavorable factors for ship-mounted crane control. In particular, to accomplish different control tasks, some plant parameters (e.g., boom lengths, payload masses, and so on) frequently change; hence, most existing model-based controllers cannot ensure satisfactory control performance any longer. For example, inaccurate gravity compensation may result in positioning errors. Additionally, due to ship roll motions caused by sea waves, residual payload swing generally exists, which may result in safety risks in practice. To solve the above-mentioned issues, this paper designs a neural network-based adaptive control method that can provide effective control for both actuated and unactuated state variables based on the original nonlinear ship-mounted crane dynamics without any linearizing operations. In particular, the proposed update law availably compensates parameter/structure uncertainties for ship-mounted crane systems. Based on a 2-D sliding surface, the boom and rope can arrive at their preset positions in finite time, and the payload swing can be completely suppressed. Furthermore, the problem of nonlinear input dead zones is also taken into account. The stability of the equilibrium point of all state variables in ship-mounted crane systems is theoretically proven by a rigorous Lyapunov-based analysis. The hardware experimental results verify the practicability and robustness of the presented control approach.","",""

Moreover, the multi-branch structure exhibits its low latency and a strong ability in mitigating overfitting issues which often occur in MI classification because of the small training dataset.","",""

Although it is safe and relatively economic, it is time-consuming. A rapid and accurate quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) model of Caco-2 permeability is helpful to improve the efficiency of oral drug development. The aim of our study is to explore the predictive ability of the QSPR model, to study its permeation mechanism, and to develop a potential permeability prediction model, for Caco-2 cells. In our study, a relatively large data set was collected and the abnormal data were eliminated using the Monte Carlo regression and hybrid quantum particle swarm optimization (HQPSO) algorithm. Then, the remaining 1827 compounds were used to establish QSPR models. To generate multiple chemically diverse training and test sets, we used a combination of principal component analysis (PCA) and self-organizing mapping (SOM) neural networks to split the modeling data set characterized by PaDEL-descriptors. After preliminary selection of descriptors by the mean decrease impurity (MDI) method, the HQPSO algorithm was used to select the key descriptors. Six different methods, namely, multivariate linear regression (MLR), support vector machine regression (SVR), xgboost, radial basis function (RBF) neural networks, dual-SVR and dual-RBF were employed to develop QSPR models. The best dual-RBF model was obtained finally with R2 = 0.91, and Rcv52 = 0.77, for the training set, and RT2 = 0.77, for the test set. A series of validation methods were used to assess the robustness and predictive ability of the dual-RBF model under OECD principles. A new application domain (AD) definition method based on the descriptor importance-weighted and distance-based (IWD) method was proposed, and the outliers were analyzed carefully. Combined with the importance of the descriptors used in the dual-RBF model, we concluded that the “H E-state” and hydrogen bonds are important factors affecting the permeability of drugs passing through the Caco-2 cell. Compared with the reported studies, our method exhibits certain advantages in data size, transparency of modeling process and prediction accuracy to some extent, and is a promising tool for virtual screening in the early stage of drug development.","",""

A third-party model can be poisoned such that it works adequately in normal conditions but behaves maliciously on samples with specific trigger patterns. However, the trigger injection function is manually defined in most existing backdoor attack methods, e.g., placing a small patch of pixels on an image or slightly deforming the image before poisoning the model. This results in a two-stage approach with a sub-optimal attack success rate and a lack of complete stealthiness under human inspection.In this paper, we propose a novel and stealthy backdoor attack framework, LIRA, which jointly learns the optimal, stealthy trigger injection function and poisons the model. We formulate such an objective as a non-convex, constrained optimization problem. Under this optimization framework, the trigger generator function will learn to manipulate the input with imperceptible noise to preserve the model performance on the clean data and maximize the attack success rate on the poisoned data. Then, we solve this challenging optimization problem with an efficient, two-stage stochastic optimization procedure. Finally, the proposed attack framework achieves 100% success rates in several benchmark datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR10, GTSRB, and T-ImageNet, while simultaneously bypassing existing backdoor defense methods and human inspection.","",""

Furthermore, for steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) BCI systems, multiple states (sub-states) exist within the IC state. Existing recognition methods rely on a threshold technique, which is difficult to realize high accuracy, i.e., simultaneously high true positive rate and low false positive rate. To address this issue, we proposed a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect IC and NC states in a SSVEP-BCI system for the first time. Specifically, the steady-state motion visual evoked potentials (SSMVEP) paradigm, which has been shown to induce less visual discomfort, was chosen as the experimental paradigm. Two processing pipelines were proposed for the detection of IC and NC states. The first one was using CNN as a multi-class classifier to discriminate between all the states in IC and NC state (FFT-CNN). The second one was using CNN to discriminate between IC and NC states, and using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to perform classification tasks within the IC (FFT-CNN-CCA). We demonstrated that both pipelines achieved a significant increase in accuracy for low-performance healthy participants when traditional algorithms such as CCA threshold were used. Furthermore, the FFT-CNN-CCA pipeline achieved better performance than the FFT-CNN pipeline based on the stroke patients’ data. In summary, we showed that CNN can be used for robust detection in an asynchronous SSMVEP-BCI with great potential for out-of-lab BCI applications.","",""

Thus, each patch can preserve the texture structure around its key point rather than all patches have a predetermined size.

Using the NNs to compensate the unknown aerodynamic forces online and the robust adaptive mechanism to cancel the combination of the overlarge NNs compensation error and the external disturbances, the new robust neural identifier exhibits a better identification performance in the complex flight environment. Moreover, an optimized algorithm is included in the NNs mechanism to alleviate the burdensome online computation. By the strict Lyapunov argument, the asymptotic convergence of the inertial matrix identification error, position tracking error, and attitude tracking error to arbitrarily small neighborhood of the origin is proved. The simulation and implementation results are provided to evaluate the performance of the proposed controller.","",""

A robust unsupervised learning algorithm enables the RQNN to effectively capture the statistical behavior of the input signal and facilitates the estimation of signal embedded in noise with unknown characteristics. The results from a number of benchmark tests show that simple signals such as dc, staircase dc, and sinusoidal signals embedded within high noise can be accurately filtered and particle swarm optimization can be employed to select model parameters. The RQNN filtering procedure is applied in a two-class motor imagery-based brain-computer interface where the objective was to filter electroencephalogram (EEG) signals before feature extraction and classification to increase signal separability. A two-step inner-outer fivefold cross-validation approach is utilized to select the algorithm parameters subject-specifically for nine subjects.

The recognition of these patterns is made difficult by their substantial variation in cadence and duration. The neural circuit behaviors used are similar to those associated with brain neural integrators. In the larger context described here, this kind of circuit becomes a building block of an entirely different computational algorithm for solving complex problems. While the network behavior is simulated in detail, a collective view is essential to understanding the results. A closed equation of motion for the collective variable describes an algorithm that quantitatively accounts for many aspects of the emergent network computation. The feedback connections and ongoing activity in the network shape the collective dynamics onto a reduced dimensionality manifold of activity space, which defines the algorithm and computation actually performed.

Among the problems is the fact that as the depth of the network increases, gradient disappearance influences classification accuracy and the corresponding increasing number of parameters to be learned increases the possibility of overfitting, especially when only a small amount of VHRRS labeled samples are acquired for training. Further, the hidden layers in DNNs are not transparent enough, which results in extracted features not being sufficiently discriminative and significant amounts of redundancy. This paper proposes a novel depth-width-reinforced DNN that solves these problems to produce better per-pixel classification results in VHRRS. In the proposed method, densely connected neural networks and internal classifiers are combined to build a deeper network and balance the network depth and performance. This strengthens the gradients, decreases negative effects from gradient disappearance as the network depth increases and enhances the transparency of hidden layers, making extracted features more discriminative and reducing the risk of overfitting. In addition, the proposed method uses multi-scale filters to create a wider neural network. The depth of the filters from each scale is controlled to decrease redundancy and the multi-scale filters enable utilization of joint spatio-spectral information and diverse local spatial structure simultaneously. Furthermore, the concept of network in network is applied to better fuse the deeper and wider designs, making the network operate more smoothly. The results of experiments conducted on BJ02, GF02, geoeye and quickbird satellite images verify the efficacy of the proposed method. The proposed method not only achieves competitive classification results but also proves that the network can continue to be robust and perform well even while the amount of labeled training samples is decreasing, which fits the small training samples situation faced by VHRRS per-pixel classification.","",""

This article proposes an experimental approach for determining ANN parameters in a robust manner for predicting the roll force in a hot strip mill process. Four design variables and two noise variables are included in the experiment, a full factorial design is adopted for the design matrix to estimate all main and two factor interaction effects, and the signal-to-noise (SN) ratio is used as a performance measure for achieving robustness. In the second experiment, only a fraction of the full factorial design is used as the design matrix and the results are compared with those from the full factorial experiment in terms of prediction accuracy. Experimental results show that the learning rate is the most significant parameter in terms of the SN ratio. The proposed method has a general applicability and can be used to alleviate the burden of selecting appropriate ANN parameter values.","",""

This paper explores a novel, bio-inspired spiking convolutional neural network (CNN) that is trained in a greedy, layer-wise fashion. The spiking CNN consists of a convolutional/pooling layer followed by a feature discovery layer, both of which undergo bio-inspired learning. Kernels for the convolutional layer are trained using a sparse, spiking auto-encoder representing primary visual features. The feature discovery layer uses a probabilistic spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) learning rule. This layer represents complex visual features using WTA-thresholded, leaky, integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons. The new model is evaluated on the MNIST digit dataset using clean and noisy images. Intermediate results show that the convolutional layer is stack-admissible, enabling it to support a multi-layer learning architecture. The recognition performance for clean images is above 98%. This performance is accounted for by the independent and informative visual features extracted in a hierarchy of convolutional and feature discovery layers. The performance loss for recognizing the noisy images is in the range 0.1% to 8.5%. This level of performance loss indicates that the network is robust to additive noise.","",""

Based on many known properties of cortical neurons, hierarchical temporal memory (HTM) sequence memory recently has been proposed as a theoretical framework for sequence learning in the cortex. In this letter, we analyze properties of HTM sequence memory and apply it to sequence learning and prediction problems with streaming data. We show the model is able to continuously learn a large number of variable order temporal sequences using an unsupervised Hebbian-like learning rule. The sparse temporal codes formed by the model can robustly handle branching temporal sequences by maintaining multiple predictions until there is sufficient disambiguating evidence. We compare the HTM sequence memory with other sequence learning algorithms, including statistical methods—autoregressive integrated moving average; feedforward neural networks—time delay neural network and online sequential extreme learning machine; and recurrent neural networks—long short-term memory and echo-state networks on sequence prediction problems with both artificial and real-world data. The HTM model achieves comparable accuracy to other state-of-the-art algorithms. The model also exhibits properties that are critical for sequence learning, including continuous online learning, the ability to handle multiple predictions and branching sequences with high-order statistics, robustness to sensor noise and fault tolerance, and good performance without task-specific hyperparameter tuning. Therefore, the HTM sequence memory not only advances our understanding of how the brain may solve the sequence learning problem but is also applicable to real-world sequence learning problems from continuous data streams.","",""

In biological vision systems, scientists have found that specific types of visual neurons have specific preferences to each of the three motion elements. There are computational models on translation and expansion/contraction perceptions; however, little has been done in the past to create computational models for rotational motion perception. To fill this gap, we proposed a neural network that utilizes a specific spatiotemporal arrangement of asymmetric lateral inhibited direction selective neural networks (DSNNs) for rotational motion perception. The proposed neural network consists of two parts—presynaptic and postsynaptic parts. In the presynaptic part, there are a number of lateral inhibited DSNNs to extract directional visual cues. In the postsynaptic part, similar to the arrangement of the directional columns in the cerebral cortex, these direction selective neurons are arranged in a cyclic order to perceive rotational motion cues. In the postsynaptic network, the delayed excitation from each direction selective neuron is multiplied by the gathered excitation from this neuron and its unilateral counterparts depending on which rotation, clockwise (cw) or counter-cw (ccw), to perceive. Systematic experiments under various conditions and settings have been carried out and validated the robustness and reliability of the proposed neural network in detecting cw or ccw rotational motion. This research is a critical step further toward dynamic visual information processing.","",""

As a result, the prediction accuracy, when these bins were not present, was increased by 15%.

Instead of a single level PI, wind power forecast uncertainties are represented in a list of PIs. These PIs are then decomposed into quantiles of wind power. A new scenario generation method is proposed to handle wind power forecast uncertainties. For each hour, an empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) is fitted to these quantile points. The Monte Carlo simulation method is used to generate scenarios from the ECDF. Then the wind power scenarios are incorporated into a stochastic security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) model. The heuristic genetic algorithm is utilized to solve the stochastic SCUC problem. Five deterministic and four stochastic case studies incorporated with interval forecasts of wind power are implemented. The results of these cases are presented and discussed together. Generation costs, and the scheduled and real-time economic dispatch reserves of different unit commitment strategies are compared. The experimental results show that the stochastic model is more robust than deterministic ones and, thus, decreases the risk in system operations of smart grids.","",""

The proposed controller consists of high-gain feedback, Nussbaum gain matrix selector, online approximator (OLA) model and a robust term. The OLA model is represented by a two-layer neural network. The continuousness of the control signal is guaranteed to relax the requirement for the actuator bandwidth and avoid the incurred chattering effect. Asymptotic tracking performance is achieved theoretically by standard Lyapunov analysis. The control feasibility is also verified in simulation environment.","",""
