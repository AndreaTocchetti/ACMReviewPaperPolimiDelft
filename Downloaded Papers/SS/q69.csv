However, two limitations occur in the existing ZNN models. The first one is the convergence time that tends to be infinitely large. The second one is the research of robustness that remains in the analyses of stability and asymptotic convergence. To simultaneously enhance the convergence performance and robustness, this article proposes a new ZNN model by using a supertwisting (ST) algorithm, termed STZNN model, for the tracking control of mobile robot manipulators. The proposed STZNN model inherently possesses the advantages of finite-time convergence and robustness making the control process fast and robust. The bridge from the sliding mode control to the ZNN is built, and the essential connection between the ST algorithm and ZNN is explored by constructing a unified design process. Theorems and proofs about global stability, finite-time convergence, and robustness are provided. Finally, path-tracking applications, comparisons, and tests substantiate the effectiveness and superiority of the STZNN model for the tracking control handling of mobile robot manipulators.","",""

However, the effect of connectivity patterns on network dynamics is far from being fully understood. We study the connections between edge configuration and dynamics in a simple oriented network composed of two interconnected cliques (representative of brain feedback regulatory circuitry). In this article our main goal is to study the spectra of the graph adjacency and Laplacian matrices, with a focus on three aspects in particular: (1) the sensitivity and robustness of the spectrum in response to varying the intra- and intermodular edge density, (2) the effects on the spectrum of perturbing the edge configuration while keeping the densities fixed, and (3) the effects of increasing the network size. We study some tractable aspects analytically, then simulate more general results numerically, thus aiming to motivate and explain our further work on the effect of these patterns on the network temporal dynamics and phase transitions. We discuss the implications of such results to modeling brain connectomics. We suggest potential applications to understanding synaptic restructuring in learning networks and the effects of network configuration on function of regulatory neural circuits.","",""

Classification of electroencephalography (EEG)-based motor imagery (MI) is a crucial non-invasive application in brain–computer interface (BCI) research. This paper proposes a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for accurate and robust EEG-based MI classification that outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Approach. The proposed CNN model, namely EEG-inception, is built on the backbone of the inception-time network, which has showed to be highly efficient and accurate for time-series classification. Also, the proposed network is an end-to-end classification, as it takes the raw EEG signals as the input and does not require complex EEG signal-preprocessing. Furthermore, this paper proposes a novel data augmentation method for EEG signals to enhance the accuracy, at least by 3%, and reduce overfitting with limited BCI datasets. Main results. The proposed model outperforms all state-of-the-art methods by achieving the average accuracy of 88.4% and 88.6% on the 2008 BCI Competition IV 2a (four-classes) and 2b datasets (binary-classes), respectively. Furthermore, it takes less than 0.025 s to test a sample suitable for real-time processing. Moreover, the classification standard deviation for nine different subjects achieves the lowest value of 5.5 for the 2b dataset and 7.1 for the 2a dataset, which validates that the proposed method is highly robust.

We investigate how well these robustness guarantees are preserved when the precision of a neural network is quantized. We also evaluate how effectively adversarial attacks transfer to quantized neural networks. Our results show that quantized neural networks are generally robust relative to their full precision counterpart (98.6%–99.7%), and the transfer of adversarial attacks decreases to as low as 52.05% when the subtlety of perturbation increases.

To reduce the control costs, an adaptive pinning control technique is employed. For the case where the tracking trajectory has different individual dynamic from that of the network nodes, the vertex-based adaptive strategy is proposed to drive the synchronization error to a relatively small area, which is adjustable according to the parameters of the adaptive strategy. This kind of adaptive design can enhance the robustness of the network against the external disturbance posed on the tracking trajectory.

The characteristics of existing one-class labels lead to a dilemma: it is hard to directly use a multiple classifier based on deep neural networks to solve one-class classification problems. Therefore, in this article, we propose a novel DeepOC neural network, termed as DeepOC, which can simultaneously learn compact feature representations and train a DeepOC classifier. Only with the given normal samples, we use the stacked convolutional encoder to generate their low-dimensional high-level features and train a one-class classifier to make these features as compact as possible. Meanwhile, for the sake of the correct mapping relation and the feature representations’ diversity, we utilize a decoder in order to reconstruct raw samples from these low-dimensional feature representations. This structure is gradually established using an adversarial mechanism during the training stage. This mechanism is the key to our model. It organically combines two seemingly contradictory components and allows them to take advantage of each other, thus making the model robust and effective. Unlike methods that use handcrafted features or those that are separated into two stages (extracting features and training classifiers), DeepOC is a one-stage model using reliable features that are automatically extracted by neural networks. Experiments on various benchmark data sets show that DeepOC is feasible and achieves the state-of-the-art anomaly detection results compared with a dozen existing methods.","",""

However, various working requirements and the oceanic environment may cause some uncertain and unfavorable factors for ship-mounted crane control. In particular, to accomplish different control tasks, some plant parameters (e.g., boom lengths, payload masses, and so on) frequently change; hence, most existing model-based controllers cannot ensure satisfactory control performance any longer. For example, inaccurate gravity compensation may result in positioning errors. Additionally, due to ship roll motions caused by sea waves, residual payload swing generally exists, which may result in safety risks in practice. To solve the above-mentioned issues, this paper designs a neural network-based adaptive control method that can provide effective control for both actuated and unactuated state variables based on the original nonlinear ship-mounted crane dynamics without any linearizing operations. In particular, the proposed update law availably compensates parameter/structure uncertainties for ship-mounted crane systems.

It is assumed that all nonlinearities, time-varying delays, and sensor and actuator attacks are unknown. In the concerned problem, since the state information measured by sensors is compromised by additional attack signals, the exact state variables are not available for feedback. Thus, a memoryless adaptive resilient control design using compromised state variables is developed by employing the neural-network-based function approximation technique and designing the attack compensator. The resulting control scheme ensures the robust stabilization in the presence of unknown deception attacks and time-varying delays. It is shown from the Lyapunov stability analysis that all closed-loop signals are uniformly ultimately bounded and the stabilization errors converge to an adjustable neighborhood of the origin.","",""

Existing recognition methods rely on a threshold technique, which is difficult to realize high accuracy, i.e., simultaneously high true positive rate and low false positive rate. To address this issue, we proposed a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect IC and NC states in a SSVEP-BCI system for the first time. Specifically, the steady-state motion visual evoked potentials (SSMVEP) paradigm, which has been shown to induce less visual discomfort, was chosen as the experimental paradigm. Two processing pipelines were proposed for the detection of IC and NC states. The first one was using CNN as a multi-class classifier to discriminate between all the states in IC and NC state (FFT-CNN). The second one was using CNN to discriminate between IC and NC states, and using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to perform classification tasks within the IC (FFT-CNN-CCA). We demonstrated that both pipelines achieved a significant increase in accuracy for low-performance healthy participants when traditional algorithms such as CCA threshold were used. Furthermore, the FFT-CNN-CCA pipeline achieved better performance than the FFT-CNN pipeline based on the stroke patients’ data. In summary, we showed that CNN can be used for robust detection in an asynchronous SSMVEP-BCI with great potential for out-of-lab BCI applications.","",""

The origin of this variability is uncertain, but it is usually interpreted as detrimental noise that reduces the computational accuracy of neural circuits. Here we investigate the possibility that such response variability might in fact be beneficial, because it may partially compensate for a decrease in accuracy due to stochastic changes in the synaptic strengths of a network. We study the interplay between two kinds of noise, response (or neuronal) noise and synaptic noise, by analyzing their joint influence on the accuracy of neural networks trained to perform various tasks. We find an interesting, generic interaction: when fluctuations in the synaptic connections are proportional to their strengths (multiplicative noise), a certain amount of response noise in the input neurons can significantly improve network performance, compared to the same network without response noise. Performance is enhanced because response noise and multiplicative synaptic noise are in some ways equivalent. So if the algorithm used to find the optimal synaptic weights can take into account the variability of the model neurons, it can also take into account the variability of the synapses. Thus, the connection patterns generated with response noise are typically more resistant to synaptic degradation than those obtained without response noise. As a consequence of this interplay, if multiplicative synaptic noise is present, it is better to have response noise in the network than not to have it. These results are demonstrated analytically for the most basic network consisting of two input neurons and one output neuron performing a simple classification task, but computer simulations show that the phenomenon persists in a wide range of architectures, including recurrent (attractor) networks and sensorimotor networks that perform coordinate transformations. The results suggest that response variability could play an important dynamic role in networks that continuously learn.","",""

Small perturbations to sensor inputs (from noise or adversarial examples) are often enough to change network-based decisions, which was recently shown to cause an autonomous vehicle to swerve into another lane. In light of these dangers, numerous algorithms have been developed as defensive mechanisms from these adversarial inputs, some of which provide formal robustness guarantees or certificates. This work leverages research on certified adversarial robustness to develop an online certifiably robust for deep reinforcement learning algorithms. The proposed defense computes guaranteed lower bounds on state-action values during execution to identify and choose a robust action under a worst case deviation in input space due to possible adversaries or noise. Moreover, the resulting policy comes with a certificate of solution quality, even though the true state and optimal action are unknown to the certifier due to the perturbations.

Compared with our recent DNN-based method, the proposed structure can reduce the equal error rate (EER) from 0.13 to 0.11 on the development set. The spatial features can further reduce the EER to 0.10. The performance of the end-to-end learning on raw waveforms is also comparable. Finally, on the evaluation set, we get the state-of-the-art performance with 0.12 EER while the performance of the best existing system is 0.15 EER.","",""

Intermediate results show that the convolutional layer is stack-admissible, enabling it to support a multi-layer learning architecture. The recognition performance for clean images is above 98%. This performance is accounted for by the independent and informative visual features extracted in a hierarchy of convolutional and feature discovery layers.

Several proof of concept demonstrations have shown encouraging results, but barriers to clinical translation still remain. In particular, intracortical prostheses must satisfy stringent power dissipation constraints so as not to damage cortex.   APPROACH One possible solution is to use ultra-low power neuromorphic chips to decode neural signals for these intracortical implants. The first step is to explore in simulation the feasibility of translating decoding algorithms for brain-machine interface (BMI) applications into spiking neural networks (SNNs).   MAIN RESULTS Here we demonstrate the validity of the approach by implementing an existing Kalman-filter-based decoder in a simulated SNN using the Neural Engineering Framework (NEF), a general method for mapping control algorithms onto SNNs. To measure this system's robustness and generalization, we tested it online in closed-loop BMI experiments with two rhesus monkeys. Across both monkeys, a Kalman filter implemented using a 2000-neuron SNN has comparable performance to that of a Kalman filter implemented using standard floating point techniques.   SIGNIFICANCE These results demonstrate the tractability of SNN implementations of statistical signal processing algorithms on different monkeys and for several tasks, suggesting that a SNN decoder, implemented on a neuromorphic chip, may be a feasible computational platform for low-power fully-implanted prostheses. The validation of this closed-loop decoder system and the demonstration of its robustness and generalization hold promise for SNN implementations on an ultra-low power neuromorphic chip using the NEF.","",""

We also used white moving bars in order to localize the spatial position of the recorded cells. Then recorded spikes were smoothed with a Gaussian kernel and used as the output target when training a 3D CNN in a supervised way.

Based on many known properties of cortical neurons, hierarchical temporal memory (HTM) sequence memory recently has been proposed as a theoretical framework for sequence learning in the cortex. In this letter, we analyze properties of HTM sequence memory and apply it to sequence learning and prediction problems with streaming data. We show the model is able to continuously learn a large number of variable order temporal sequences using an unsupervised Hebbian-like learning rule. The sparse temporal codes formed by the model can robustly handle branching temporal sequences by maintaining multiple predictions until there is sufficient disambiguating evidence. We compare the HTM sequence memory with other sequence learning algorithms, including statistical methods—autoregressive integrated moving average; feedforward neural networks—time delay neural network and online sequential extreme learning machine; and recurrent neural networks—long short-term memory and echo-state networks on sequence prediction problems with both artificial and real-world data. The HTM model achieves comparable accuracy to other state-of-the-art algorithms. The model also exhibits properties that are critical for sequence learning, including continuous online learning, the ability to handle multiple predictions and branching sequences with high-order statistics, robustness to sensor noise and fault tolerance, and good performance without task-specific hyperparameter tuning. Therefore, the HTM sequence memory not only advances our understanding of how the brain may solve the sequence learning problem but is also applicable to real-world sequence learning problems from continuous data streams.","",""

There are computational models on translation and expansion/contraction perceptions; however, little has been done in the past to create computational models for rotational motion perception. To fill this gap, we proposed a neural network that utilizes a specific spatiotemporal arrangement of asymmetric lateral inhibited direction selective neural networks (DSNNs) for rotational motion perception. The proposed neural network consists of two parts—presynaptic and postsynaptic parts. In the presynaptic part, there are a number of lateral inhibited DSNNs to extract directional visual cues. In the postsynaptic part, similar to the arrangement of the directional columns in the cerebral cortex, these direction selective neurons are arranged in a cyclic order to perceive rotational motion cues. In the postsynaptic network, the delayed excitation from each direction selective neuron is multiplied by the gathered excitation from this neuron and its unilateral counterparts depending on which rotation, clockwise (cw) or counter-cw (ccw), to perceive. Systematic experiments under various conditions and settings have been carried out and validated the robustness and reliability of the proposed neural network in detecting cw or ccw rotational motion.

The Monte Carlo simulation method is used to generate scenarios from the ECDF. Then the wind power scenarios are incorporated into a stochastic security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) model. The heuristic genetic algorithm is utilized to solve the stochastic SCUC problem. Five deterministic and four stochastic case studies incorporated with interval forecasts of wind power are implemented. The results of these cases are presented and discussed together. Generation costs, and the scheduled and real-time economic dispatch reserves of different unit commitment strategies are compared. The experimental results show that the stochastic model is more robust than deterministic ones and, thus, decreases the risk in system operations of smart grids.","",""

First, the control law consisting of the robust integral of a neural network (NN) output plus sign of the tracking error feedback multiplied with an adaptive gain is introduced. The NN in the control law learns the system dynamics in an online manner, while the NN residual reconstruction errors and the bounded disturbances are overcome by the error sign signal. Since both of the NN output and the error sign signal are included in the integral, the continuity of the control input is ensured. The controller structure and the NN weight update law are novel in contrast with the previous effort, and the semiglobal asymptotic tracking performance is still guaranteed by using the Lyapunov analysis. In addition, the NN weights and all other signals are proved to be bounded simultaneously. The proposed approach also relaxes the need for the upper bounds of certain terms, which are usually required in the previous designs.

It is known that the disadvantages of robust control for the NARMA model are as follows: 1) suitable control parameters for larger time delay are more sensitive to achieving desirable performance; 2) it only deals with bounded uncertainty; and 3) the nominal NARMA model must be learned in advance. Due to the dynamic feature of the NARMA model, a recurrent neural network (RNN) is online applied to learn it. However, the system performance becomes deteriorated due to the poor learning of the larger variation of system vector functions. In this situation, a simple network is employed to compensate the upper bound of the residue caused by the linear parameterization of the approximation error of RNN. An e-modification learning law with a projection for weight matrix is applied to guarantee its boundedness without persistent excitation. Under suitable conditions, the semiglobally ultimately bounded tracking with the boundedness of estimated weight matrix is obtained by the proposed RNN-based multivariable adaptive control.

It can even memorize randomly labeled data, which has little knowledge behind the instance-label pairs. When a deep network continually learns over time by accommodating new tasks, it usually quickly overwrites the knowledge learned from previous tasks. Referred to as the neural variability, it is well known in neuroscience that human brain reactions exhibit substantial variability even in response to the same stimulus. This mechanism balances accuracy and plasticity/flexibility in the motor learning of natural nervous systems. Thus, it motivates us to design a similar mechanism, named artificial neural variability (ANV), that helps artificial neural networks learn some advantages from “natural” neural networks. We rigorously prove that ANV plays as an implicit regularizer of the mutual information between the training data and the learned model. This result theoretically guarantees ANV a strictly improved generalizability, robustness to label noise, and robustness to catastrophic forgetting. We then devise a neural variable risk minimization (NVRM) framework and neural variable optimizers to achieve ANV for conventional network architectures in practice. The empirical studies demonstrate that NVRM can effectively relieve overfitting, label noise memorization, and catastrophic forgetting at negligible costs.","",""

This idea is typically framed in terms of top-down influences within a cortical control hierarchy, where prefrontal-basal ganglia loops gate multiple input-output channels, which in turn can activate or sequence motor primitives expressed in (pre-)motor cortices. Here we advance a new hypothesis, based on the notion of programmability and an interpreter-programmer computational scheme, on how the PFC can flexibly bias the selection of sensorimotor patterns depending on internal goal and task contexts. In this approach, multiple elementary behaviors representing motor primitives are expressed by a single multi-purpose neural network, which is seen as a reusable area of ""recycled"" neurons (interpreter). The PFC thus acts as a ""programmer"" that, without modifying the network connectivity, feeds the interpreter networks with specific input parameters encoding the programs (corresponding to network structures) to be interpreted by the (pre-)motor areas. Our architecture is validated in a standard test for executive function: the 1-2-AX task. Our results show that this computational framework provides a robust, scalable and flexible scheme that can be iterated at different hierarchical layers, supporting the realization of multiple goals. We discuss the plausibility of the ""programmer-interpreter"" scheme to explain the functioning of prefrontal-(pre)motor cortical hierarchies.","",""

The recognition of these patterns is made difficult by their substantial variation in cadence and duration. The neural circuit behaviors used are similar to those associated with brain neural integrators. In the larger context described here, this kind of circuit becomes a building block of an entirely different computational algorithm for solving complex problems. While the network behavior is simulated in detail, a collective view is essential to understanding the results. A closed equation of motion for the collective variable describes an algorithm that quantitatively accounts for many aspects of the emergent network computation. The feedback connections and ongoing activity in the network shape the collective dynamics onto a reduced dimensionality manifold of activity space, which defines the algorithm and computation actually performed. The external inputs are weak and are not the dominant drivers of network activity.","",""

Cognitive autonomous robots coping with this problem must solve two essential tasks: 1) understand the environment in terms of what may happen and how I can deal with this and 2) learn successful experiences for their further use in an automatic subconscious way. The recently introduced concept of compact internal representation (CIR) provides the ground for both the tasks. CIR is a specific cognitive map that compacts time-evolving situations into static structures containing information necessary for navigation. It belongs to the class of global approaches, i.e., it finds trajectories to a target when they exist but also detects situations when no solution can be found. Here we extend the concept of situations with mobile targets. Then using CIR as a core, we propose a closed-loop neural network architecture consisting of conscious and subconscious pathways for efficient decision-making. The conscious pathway provides solutions to novel situations if the default subconscious pathway fails to guide the agent to a target. Employing experiments with roving robots and numerical simulations, we show that the proposed architecture provides the robot with cognitive abilities and enables reliable and flexible navigation in realistic time-evolving environments. We prove that the subconscious pathway is robust against uncertainty in the sensory information. Thus if a novel situation is similar but not identical to the previous experience (because of, e.g., noisy perception) then the subconscious pathway is able to provide an effective solution.","",""

We demonstrate that the RNN, an ESN implementation termed a FORCE decoder (from first order reduced and controlled error learning), learns the task quickly and significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art method, the velocity Kalman filter (VKF), using the measure of target acquire time. We also demonstrate that the FORCE decoder generalizes to a more difficult task by successfully operating the BMI in a randomized point-to-point task. The FORCE decoder is also robust as measured by the success rate over extended sessions. Finally, we show that decoded cursor dynamics are more like naturalistic hand movements than those of the VKF. Taken together, these results suggest that RNNs in general, and the FORCE decoder in particular, are powerful tools for BMI decoder applications.","",""

The connectivity from mitral/tufted cells to PC neurons was self-organized from a mutual information measure and by using a competitive Hebbian–Bayesian learning algorithm based on the response patterns of mitral/tufted cells to different odors yielding a distributed feed-forward projection to the PC. The PC was implemented as a modular attractor network with a recurrent connectivity that was likewise organized through Hebbian–Bayesian learning.

In particular, these features are obvious in disabled users' typing streams. This paper proposes a new concept called noisy language modeling by further developing information theory and applies neural networks to one of its specific application-typing stream. This paper experimentally uses a neural network approach to analyze the disabled users' typing streams both in general and specific ways to identify their typing behaviors and subsequently, to make typing predictions and typing corrections. In this paper, a focused time-delay neural network (FTDNN) language model, a time gap model, a prediction model based on time gap, and a probabilistic neural network model (PNN) are developed. A 38% first hitting rate (HR) and a 53% first three HR in symbol prediction are obtained based on the analysis of a user's typing history through the FTDNN language modeling, while the modeling results using the time gap prediction model and the PNN model demonstrate that the correction rates lie predominantly in between 65% and 90% with the current testing samples, and 70% of all test scores above basic correction rates, respectively. The modeling process demonstrates that a neural network is a suitable and robust language modeling tool to analyze the noisy language stream.

Therefore, this paper proposes a novel subject-transfer framework for decoding hand movements, which is robust in terms of intra-user variability.

The experimental results indicate that, when compared to the self-decoding framework, which uses only the target subject’s data, the proposed framework can successfully decode hand movements with improved performance in both healthy and amputee subjects.

This method decomposes the large-scale width optimization problem into several subspace optimization (SSO) problems, each of which has a single optimization variable and smaller training and validation data sets so as to greatly simplify optimization complexity. These SSOs can be solved concurrently, thus computational time can be effectively reduced. With top-level system coordination, the optimization of SSOs can converge to a consistent optimum, which is equivalent to the optimum of the original width optimization problem. The proposed method is tested with four mathematical examples and one practical engineering approximation problem. The results demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of CSWO in optimizing width parameters over the traditional width optimization methods.","",""

However, unlike typical signatures such as slow or sharp waves in ictal periods, the signal patterns in preictal periods are usually subtle, and highly individual-dependent. How to extract effective and robust preictal features is still a challenging problem. Most recently, graph convolutional neural network (GCNN) has demonstrated the strength in the electroencephalogram (EEG) and intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) signal modeling, due to its advantages in describing complex relationships among different EEG/iEEG regions. However, current GCNN models are not suitable for seizure prediction. The effectiveness of GCNNs highly relies on prior graphs that describe the underlying relationships in EEG regions. However, due to the complex mechanism of seizure evolution, the underlying relationship in the preictal period can be diverse in different patients, making it almost impossible to build a proper prior graph in general. To deal with this problem, we propose a novel approach to automatically learn a patient-specific graph in a data-driven way, which is called the joint graph structure and representation learning network (JGRN). JGRN constructs a global-local graph convolutional neural network which jointly learns the graph structures and connection weights in a task-related learning process in iEEG signals, thus the learned graph and feature representations can be optimized toward the objective of seizure prediction. Experimental results show that our JGRN outperforms CNN and GCNN models remarkably, and the improvement is more obvious when preictal features are subtle.","",""

Neural-symbolic computing aims at integrating, as foreseen by Valiant, two most fundamental cognitive abilities: the ability to learn from the environment, and the ability to reason from what has been learned. Neural-symbolic computing has been an active topic of research for many years, reconciling the advantages of robust learning in neural networks and reasoning and interpretability of symbolic representation. In this paper, we survey recent accomplishments of neural-symbolic computing as a principled methodology for integrated machine learning and reasoning. We illustrate the effectiveness of the approach by outlining the main characteristics of the methodology: principled integration of neural learning with symbolic knowledge representation and reasoning allowing for the construction of explainable AI systems.

This paper identifies two limitations of the existing RNN solutions for manipulator control, i.e., position error accumulation and the convex restriction on the projection set, and overcomes them by proposing two modified neural network models. Our method allows nonconvex sets for projection operations, and control error does not accumulate over time in the presence of noise.

The dynamics, however, are assumed to be corrupted by perturbations modeling the error, which might be incurred due to limitations of the biology, intrinsic neuronal noise, and imperfect measurements. We show that error, and the associated uncertainty surrounding a learned solution, can be controlled in large part by trading off synchronization strength among multiple redundant neural systems against the noise amplitude. The impact of the coupling between such redundant systems is quantified by the spectrum of the network Laplacian, and we discuss the role of network topology in synchronization and in reducing the effect of noise.

Other sources of instability are the external disturbances that come along with training sample as well as the internal disturbances that arise due to modeling imperfection. The unstable learning scenario can be indirectly observed in the form of surges, which are sudden increases in the learning cost and are a common occurrence during SpikeProp training. Research in the past has shown that proper learning step size is crucial to minimize surges during training process. To determine proper learning step in order to avoid steep learning manifolds, we perform weight convergence analysis of SpikeProp learning in the presence of disturbance signals. The weight convergence analysis is further extended to robust stability analysis linked with overall system error. This ensures boundedness of the total learning error with minimal assumption of bounded disturbance signals. These analyses result in the learning rate normalization scheme, which are the key results of this paper.

We validated our tool by simulating data recorded from the first olfactory relay of an insect. Different key aspects make this tool suitable for testing the robustness and accuracy of neural signal processing algorithms (such as the detection, alignment, and classification of spikes). For instance, most of the parameters can be defined by a probabilistic distribution, then tens of simulations may be obtained from the same scenario. This is especially useful when validating the robustness of the processing algorithm. Moreover, the number of active cells and the exact firing activity of each one of them is perfectly known, which provides an easy way to test accuracy.","",""

The adaboost algorithm employs an iterative approach which combines weak classifiers to approximate a Bayes classifier. It requires performance of each weak classifier to be a little better than random guessing. In the approach, we use several neural network based weak classifiers to make one strong classifier and each weak classifier contains only one hidden layer. As the weak classifiers are simple, therefore, these does not require a lot of time for training and, therefore, are time efficient. Back propagation algorithm is used for the learning purposes. In the approach, weights are assigned to each training sample and those are boosted in subsequent iterations for the misclassified training samples, therefore, providing more robust approach to classify difficult samples. A confidence score is assigned to each weak classifier. Final classifier is achieved by linear combination of all the weak classifiers. Entropy gain clustered PCA is used for the dimension reduction of the data. We performed experiments on real hyperspectral dataset of AVIRIS Indian Pines and the comparisons with neural network and ML based approaches prove the efficiency of the proposed approach.","",""

This paper presents an alternative neural information processing architecture using the Schrödinger wave equation (SWE) for enhancement of the raw EEG signal. The raw EEG signal obtained during the motor imagery (MI) of a BCI user is intrinsically embedded with non-Gaussian noise while the actual signal is still a mystery. The proposed work in the field of recurrent quantum neural network (RQNN) is designed to filter such non-Gaussian noise using an unsupervised learning scheme without making any assumption about the signal type. The proposed learning architecture has been modified to do away with the Hebbian learning associated with the existing RQNN architecture as this learning scheme was found to be unstable for complex signals such as EEG. Besides, this the soliton behaviour of the non-linear SWE was not properly preserved in the existing scheme. The unsupervised learning algorithm proposed in this paper is able to efficiently capture the statistical behaviour of the input signal while making the algorithm robust to parametric sensitivity. This denoised EEG signal is then fed as an input to the feature extractor to obtain the Hjorth features. These features are then used to train a Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) classifier. It is shown that the accuracy of the classifier output over the training and the evaluation datasets using the filtered EEG is much higher compared to that using the raw EEG signal. The improvement in classification accuracy computed over nine subjects is found to be statistically significant.","",""

When only time series measurements from such systems are available, neural network based models are preferred due to their simplicity, availability, and robustness. However, the type of neural network used should be capable of modeling the highly non-linear behavior and the multiattractor nature of such systems. In this paper we use a special type of recurrent neural network called the ""Dynamic System' Imitator (DSI)"", that has been proven to be capable of modeling very complex dynamic behaviors. The DSI is a fully recurrent neural network that is specially designed to model a wide variety of dynamic systems. The prediction method presented in this paper is based upon predicting one step ahead in the time series, and using that predicted value to iteratively predict the following steps. This method was applied to chaotic time series generated from the logistic, Henon, and the cubic equations, in addition to experimental pressure drop time series measured from a Fluidized Bed Reactor (FBR), which is known to exhibit chaotic behavior. The time behavior and state space attractor of the actual and network synthetic chaotic time series were analyzed and compared. The correlation dimension and the Kolmogorov entropy for both the original and network synthetic data were computed. They were found to resemble each other, confirming the success of the DSI based chaotic system modeling. J","",""

In the proposed adaptive NN control, the usual assumption on nonsingularity of NN approximation for unknown control coefficient matrices and boundary assumption between NN approximation error and control input have been eliminated. Command filters are presented to implement physical constraints on the virtual control laws, then the tedious analytic computations of time derivatives of virtual control laws are canceled.
