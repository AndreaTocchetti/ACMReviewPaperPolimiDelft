In this paper it is experimentally demonstrated that the selected teacher can indeed have a significant effect on knowledge transfer. To overcome this limitation, we propose a curriculum-based teacher ensemble that allows for performing robust and efficient knowledge distillation. The proposed method is motivated by the way that humans learn through a curriculum, as well as supported by recent findings that hints to the existence of critical learning periods in neural networks.

Most conventional fingerprinting algorithms were developed by assembling manually designed feature extractor and quantizer, which requires extensive expert knowledge and may not capture the intrinsic or abstract visual characteristics of the digital image. Focusing on content identification related applications, we propose a data-driven image fingerprinting algorithm in this paper, where neural network is trained to automatically discover the optimal mapping from image to fingerprint. To ameliorate the difficulty of training, we start by training the fingerprint-computation network in a layer-wise manner to progressively improve its robustness against content-preserving distortions. Initialized by the states learned by layer-wise training, the network is then re-trained as a holistic unit, with the objective of maximizing its content identification accuracy. Moreover, we also develop a key-dependent version of the neural network-based fingerprinting algorithm. By quantifying its security using information-theoretic metrics, we have proved that the hierarchical architecture of neural network is beneficial to the security of fingerprinting algorithm. The experimental results on a large testing database show that the proposed work exhibits much higher content identification accuracy than state-of-the-art algorithms, and its execution speed is in the millisecond time scale.","",""

However, their robustness against adversarial attacks is criticized. Prior studies show that using unnoticeable modifications on graph topology or nodal features can significantly reduce the performances of GNNs. It is very challenging to design robust graph neural networks against poisoning attack and several efforts have been taken. Existing work aims at reducing the negative impact from adversarial edges only with the poisoned graph, which is sub-optimal since they fail to discriminate adversarial edges from normal ones. On the other hand, clean graphs from similar domains as the target poisoned graph are usually available in the real world. By perturbing these clean graphs, we create supervised knowledge to train the ability to detect adversarial edges so that the robustness of GNNs is elevated. However, such potential for clean graphs is neglected by existing work. To this end, we investigate a novel problem of improving the robustness of GNNs against poisoning attacks by exploring clean graphs. Specifically, we propose PA-GNN, which relies on a penalized aggregation mechanism that directly restrict the negative impact of adversarial edges by assigning them lower attention coefficients. To optimize PA-GNN for a poisoned graph, we design a meta-optimization algorithm that trains PA-GNN to penalize perturbations using clean graphs and their adversarial counterparts, and transfers such ability to improve the robustness of PA-GNN on the poisoned graph. Experimental results on four real-world datasets demonstrate the robustness of PA-GNN against poisoning attacks on graphs. Code and data are available here: this https URL.","",""

After introducing relevant terminology and the goals and range of possible knowledge of both attackers and defenders, we survey recent work on test-time evasion (TTE), data poisoning (DP), backdoor DP, and reverse engineering (RE) attacks and particularly defenses against the same. In so doing, we distinguish robust classification from anomaly detection (AD), unsupervised from supervised, and statistical hypothesis-based defenses from ones that do not have an explicit null (no attack) hypothesis. We also consider several scenarios for detecting backdoors. We provide a technical assessment for reviewed works, including identifying any issues/limitations, required hyperparameters, needed computational complexity, as well as the performance measures evaluated and the obtained quality. We then delve deeper, providing novel insights that challenge conventional AL wisdom and that target unresolved issues, including: robust classification versus AD as a defense strategy; the belief that attack success increases with attack strength, which ignores susceptibility to AD; small perturbations for TTE attacks: a fallacy or a requirement; validity of the universal assumption that a TTE attacker knows the ground-truth class for the example to be attacked; black, gray, or white-box attacks as the standard for defense evaluation; and susceptibility of query-based RE to an AD defense. We also discuss attacks on the privacy of training data. We then present benchmark comparisons of several defenses against TTE, RE, and backdoor DP attacks on images.

This paper proposes a tailor‐made algorithm for efficiently designing the appropriate architecture of Bayesian neural network with simultaneously optimized hidden neuron number and custom transfer functions in both hidden and output layers. To cooperate with the proposed algorithm, both the Jacobian of the network function and Hessian of the negative logarithm of weight posterior are derived analytically by matrix calculus.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach Neural Attentive model for cross-domain Aspect-level sentiment CLassification (NAACL), which leverages the benefits of the supervised deep neural network as well as the unsupervised probabilistic generative model to strengthen the representation learning. NAACL jointly learns two tasks: (i) a domain classifier, working on documents in both the source and target domains to recognize the domain information of input texts and transfer knowledge from the source domain to the target domain. In particular, a weakly supervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation model (wsLDA) is proposed to learn the domain-specific aspect and sentiment lexicon representations that are then used to calculate the aspect/lexicon-aware document representations via a multi-view attention mechanism; (ii) an aspect-level sentiment classifier, sharing the document modeling with the domain classifier. It makes use of the domain classification results and the aspect/sentiment-aware document representations to classify the aspect-level sentiment of the document in domain adaptation scenario. NAACL is evaluated on both English and Chinese datasets with the out-of-domain as well as in-domain setups. Quantitatively, the experiments demonstrate that NAACL has robust superiority over the compared methods in terms of classification accuracy and F1 score.

We derive bounds for L spaces, 1 < p < m, recovering the 0(1 /&) bounds of Barron and Jones for the case p = 2. The results were motivated in part by the desire to understand approximation in the more “robust” (resistant to exemplar noise) LP, 1 ~ p <2 norms.

For example, S may be the set of possible sigmoidal activation functions, {g : ~d ~[% 6 ~d, b E ~, s.t. g(z) = a(a . z + b)}, in which case the approximants are single hidden layer neural networks with a linear output layer.

Consider the important rate of approximation issue, i.e. the rate at which the achievable error reduces as we allow larger subsets of S to be used in const rutting the approximant. In the context of neural networks, this is the question of how the approximation error scales with the number of hidden units in the network.

The controller is designed by introducing NN approximation, which can be adjusted by an adaptive law based on the backstepping approach. The developed NN controller does not require a priori knowledge of the unknown backlash hysteresis. In particular, unlike existing results on adaptive compensation for unknown backlash hysteresis, the sign of b is no longer needed.

In this paper, we propose a digital image watermarking technique using auto-encoder based CNN which is robust to different noises and attacks like salt & pepper, Gaussian and JPEG effect. The proposed method, to the best of our knowledge, is the very first attempt of CNN in the domain of watermarking. We compare the performance of the proposed technique with the existing techniques which are based on spatial domain and transform domain. We show that the proposed method of watermarking using auto encoder based CNN (ACNNWM) gives better or on par results with the existing methods.","",""

That is, the mapped sonar data assumes the form of a character unique to its respective region, thereby allowing an autonomous vehicle to determine which room it is in without knowing how or when it got there. With a robust exploration routine, this GSL solution can be time-, translation-, and rotation-invariant. The GSL solution can also become independent of the mobile robot used to collect the sensor data. This suggests that a single robot can transfer its knowledge of various learned regions to other mobile robots. This paper describes the exploration routine and the type of neural network used to solve the GSL problem.

A new local dataset is manually annotated and used to train a neural network for pixel-level semantic image information. Since data annotation is time-consuming, we evaluate the transferability of CNNs and the performance of different data augmentation methods for dataset expansion. Small datasets are normally considered not sufficient for training a neural network from scratch. This paper presents an incremental fine-tunning algorithm to update the pre-trained network. The experimental results show that it is possible to successfully transfer semantic features to a different environment by incorporating a relatively small number of local images.","",""

In contrast to the widely used spatial regularisation or feature selection methods, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that channel selection has been advocated for DCF-based tracking. We demonstrate that our GFS-DCF method is able to significantly improve the performance of a DCF tracker equipped with deep neural network features. In addition, our GFS-DCF enables joint feature selection and filter learning, achieving enhanced discrimination and interpretability of the learned filters. To further improve the performance, we adaptively integrate historical information by constraining filters to be smooth across temporal frames, using an efficient low-rank approximation. By design, specific temporal-spatial-channel configurations are dynamically learned in the tracking process, highlighting the relevant features, and alleviating the performance degrading impact of less discriminative representations and reducing information redundancy.

To begin with, the event-triggered robust nonlinear control problem is transformed into an event-triggered nonlinear optimal control problem by introducing an infinite-horizon integral cost for the nominal system. Then, a recurrent neural network (RNN) and adaptive critic designs (ACDs) are employed to solve the derived event-triggered nonlinear optimal control problem. The RNN is applied to reconstruct the system dynamics based on collected system data. After acquiring the knowledge of system dynamics, a unique critic network is proposed to obtain the approximate solution of the event-triggered Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation within the framework of ACDs. The critic network is updated by using simultaneously historical and instantaneous state data. An advantage of the present critic network update law is that it can relax the persistence of excitation condition. Meanwhile, under a newly developed event-triggering condition, the proposed critic network tuning rule not only guarantees the critic network weights to converge to optimums but also ensures nominal system states to be uniformly ultimately bounded. Moreover, by using Lyapunov method, it is proved that the derived optimal event-triggered control (ETC) guarantees uniform ultimate boundedness of all the signals in the original system. Finally, a nonlinear oscillator and an unstable power system are provided to validate the developed robust ETC scheme.","",""

The proposed framework adopts a novel idea that first introduces some new generic noise to destroy adversarial perturbations, and then learns to predict saliency maps for input images with the introduced noise.

METHODS A 3D Convolutional Neural Network was trained for automatic bladder segmentation of the CT scans. The automatic bladder segmentation alongside the CT scan are jointly optimized to add explicit knowledge about the underlying anatomy to the registration algorithm. We included three datasets from different institutes and CT manufacturers. The first was used for training and testing the ConvNet, where the second and the third were used for evaluation of the proposed pipeline. The system performance was quantified geometrically using the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), the Mean Surface Distance (MSD), and the 95% Hausdorff Distance (HD). The propagated contours were validated clinically through generating the associated IMPT plans and compare it with the IMPT plans based on the manual delineations. Propagated contours were considered clinically acceptable if their treatment plans met the dosimetric coverage constraints on the manual contours.   RESULTS The bladder segmentation network achieved a DSC of 88% and 82% on the test datasets. The proposed registration pipeline achieved a MSD of 1:29±0:39, 1:48±1:16, and 1:49±0:44 mm for the prostate, seminal vesicles, and lymph nodes, respectively on the second dataset and a MSD of 2:31 ± 1:92 and 1:76 ± 1:39 mm for the prostate and seminal vesicles on the third dataset. The automatically propagated contours met the dose coverage constraints in 86%, 91%, and 99% of the cases for the prostate, seminal vesicles, and lymph nodes, respectively. A Conservative Success Rate (CSR) of 80% was obtained, compared to 65% when only using intensity-based registration.   CONCLUSION The proposed registration pipeline obtained highly promising results for generating treatment plans adapted to the daily anatomy.

Unfortunately, existing GNN-based frameworks still confront 3 severe problems: low representational power, stacking in a flat way, and poor robustness to noise. In this work, we propose a novel multi-level graph neural network (M-GNN) to address the above challenges. We first identify an injective aggregate scheme and design a powerful GNN layer using multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). Then, we define graph coarsening schemes for various kinds of relations, and stack GNN layers on a series of coarsened graphs, so as to model hierarchical structures. Furthermore, attention mechanisms are adopted so that our approach can make predictions accurately even on the noisy knowledge graph. Results on WN18 and FB15k datasets show that our approach is effective in the standard link prediction task, significantly and consistently outperforming competitive baselines. Furthermore, robustness analysis on FB15k-237 dataset demonstrates that our proposed M-GNN is highly robust to sparsity and noise. ","",""

We introduce a neural network architecture, which performs multichannel filtering in the first layer of the network, and show that this network learns to be robust to varying target speaker direction of arrival, performing as well as a model that is given oracle knowledge of the true target speaker direction. Next, we show how performance can be improved by factoring  the first layer to separate the multichannel spatial filtering operation from a single channel filterbank which computes a frequency decomposition. We also introduce an adaptive variant, which updates the spatial filter coefficients at each time frame based on the previous inputs. Finally, we demonstrate that these approaches can be implemented more efficiently in the frequency domain.

SSVEPs are robust signals measurable in the electroencephalogram (EEG) and are commonly used in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However, methods for high-accuracy decoding of SSVEPs usually require hand-crafted approaches that leverage domain-specific knowledge of the stimulus signals, such as specific temporal frequencies in the visual stimuli and their relative spatial arrangement. When this knowledge is unavailable, such as when SSVEP signals are acquired asynchronously, such approaches tend to fail.   APPROACH In this paper, we show how a compact convolutional neural network (Compact-CNN), which only requires raw EEG signals for automatic feature extraction, can be used to decode signals from a 12-class SSVEP dataset without the need for user-specific calibration.   MAIN RESULTS The Compact-CNN demonstrates across subject mean accuracy of approximately 80%, out-performing current state-of-the-art, hand-crafted approaches using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and Combined-CCA. Furthermore, the Compact-CNN approach can reveal the underlying feature representation, revealing that the deep learner extracts additional phase- and amplitude-related features associated with the structure of the dataset.   SIGNIFICANCE We discuss how our Compact-CNN shows promise for BCI applications that allow users to freely gaze/attend to any stimulus at any time (e.g. asynchronous BCI) as well as provides a method for analyzing SSVEP signals in a way that might augment our understanding about the basic processing in the visual cortex.","",""

Owing to warming trends experienced in the past and predicted for the future, precise knowledge about the development of snow cover and snow duration in the future is becoming more and more important. On the basis of the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) A1B scenario, this paper investigates the possible regional development of snow cover and snow duration in the Black Forest in southwest Germany until 2050. For this purpose, we developed a new method that combines Non‐linear AutoRegressive networks with eXogenous inputs (NARX) with Remote Sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS). With this non‐parametric approach, we try to define with preferably high accuracy a simple transferable model. Besides the general problem of developing a robust statistical model, our main focus is on the enhancement of the spatial resolution of snow patterns by incorporating complex structures of the underlying terrain using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data. The results suggest a possible decrease in the number of snow days (snow cover ≥ 10 cm) in the decade 2041–2050 by 10 to 44% at altitudes higher than 1200 m, by 17 to 57% at 1000–1200 m and 25 to 66% at 500–1000 m. This results in a dramatic shortening of the snow season mainly caused by earlier snow melt initiation rather than by later first snow precipitation in autumn. These considerable changes in the snow season would cause enormous losses in the skiing and tourism industries. In this context, the obtained high‐resolution snow data and maps can provide a useful tool and decision‐making aid for the economy and politics. Copyright © 2009 Royal Meteorological Society","",""

The memory size of the proposed method increases adaptively with learning patterns. Therefore, it suffers neither redundancy nor insufficiency of memory size, even in an environment in which the maximum number of associative pairs to be presented is unknown before learning.

However, such a parametric approach is not robust, and its performance is severely affected by the correctness of the utilized parametric model. In this letter, a new multicomponent image segmentation method is developed using a nonparametric unsupervised artificial neural network called Kohonen's self-organizing map (SOM) and hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA). SOM is used to detect the main features that are present in the image; then, HGA is used to cluster the image into homogeneous regions without any a priori knowledge.

In particular, there is a strong need for developing algorithms for robust classification of human activity data that specifically address challenges associated with dynamic environments (e.g. different users, signal heterogeneity).

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) released by microglia emerges as an exception in this riddle. Here, we review the current knowledge on the role played by microglial BDNF in controlling neuronal excitability by causing disinhibition. The efforts made by different laboratories during the last decade have collectively provided a robust mechanistic paradigm which elucidates the mechanisms involved in the synthesis and release of BDNF from microglia, the downstream TrkB-mediated signals in neurons, and the biophysical mechanism by which disinhibition occurs, via the downregulation of the K+-Cl− cotransporter KCC2, dysrupting Cl−homeostasis, and hence the strength of GABAA- and glycine receptor-mediated inhibition.

Inspired by this, we propose an accurate and robust approach, referred to as Latent HyperNet (LHN). The LHN uses feature maps from early layers (hyper) and projects them, individually, onto a low dimensionality (latent) space. Then, these latent features are concatenated and presented to a classifier. To demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of the LHN, we evaluate it using four different network architectures in five publicly available HAR datasets based on wearable sensors, which vary in the sampling rate and number of activities. We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed LHN is able to capture rich information, improving the results regarding the original ConvNets.

The control design falls neatly into two parts. One is to steer individual marine surface vehicle to track a predefined path and the other is to synchronise the along-path speed and path variables under the constraints of an underlying communication network. Within these two formulations, a robust adaptive path-following controller is first designed for individual vehicles based on backstepping and neural network techniques. Then, a decentralised synchronisation control law is derived by means of consensus on along-path speed and path variables based on graph theory. The distinct feature of this design lies in that synchronised path following can be reached for any undirected connected communication graphs without accurate knowledge of the model. This result is further extended to the output feedback case, where an observer-based cooperative path-following controller is developed without measuring the velocity of each vehicle. For both designs, rigorous theoretical analysis demonstrate that all signals in the closed-loop system are semi-global uniformly ultimately bounded. Simulation results validate the performance and robustness improvement of the proposed strategy.","",""

Adversarial augmentation contains two neural network modules that are trained jointly and competitively in an adversarial manner, where a generator network mixes different corrupted images to confuse a pose estimator, improving the robustness of the pose estimator by learning from harder samples. To compensate for the noise patterns by adversarial augmentation, knowledge distillation is applied to transfer clean pose structure knowledge to the target pose estimator. (3) Extensive experiments show that AdvMix significantly increases the robustness of pose estimations across a wide range of corruptions, while maintaining accuracy on clean data in various challenging benchmark datasets.","",""

Our proposed solution is to first track all objects in the scene without relying on object-specific prior knowledge, which in other systems can take the form of hand-crafted features or user-based track initialization. We then classify the tracked objects with a fast-learning image classifier, that is based on a shallow convolutional neural network architecture and demonstrate that object recognition improves when this is combined with object state information from the tracking algorithm. We argue that by transferring the use of prior knowledge from the detection and tracking stages to the classification stage, we can design a robust, general purpose object recognition system with the ability to detect and track a variety of object types. We describe our biologically inspired implementation, which adaptively learns the shape and motion of tracked objects, and apply it to the Neovision2 Tower benchmark data set, which contains multiple object types. An experimental evaluation demonstrates that our approach is competitive with the state-of-the-art video object recognition systems that do make use of object-specific prior knowledge in detection and tracking, while providing additional practical advantages by virtue of its generality.","",""

Among various machine health monitoring approaches, data-driven methods are gaining in popularity due to the development of advanced sensing and data analytic techniques. However, considering the noise, varying length and irregular sampling behind sensory data, this kind of sequential data cannot be fed into classification and regression models directly. Therefore, previous work focuses on feature extraction/fusion methods requiring expensive human labor and high quality expert knowledge. With the development of deep learning methods in the last few years, which redefine representation learning from raw data, a deep neural network structure named Convolutional Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory networks (CBLSTM) has been designed here to address raw sensory data. CBLSTM firstly uses CNN to extract local features that are robust and informative from the sequential input. Then, bi-directional LSTM is introduced to encode temporal information. Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) are able to capture long-term dependencies and model sequential data, and the bi-directional structure enables the capture of past and future contexts. Stacked, fully-connected layers and the linear regression layer are built on top of bi-directional LSTMs to predict the target value. Here, a real-life tool wear test is introduced, and our proposed CBLSTM is able to predict the actual tool wear based on raw sensory data. The experimental results have shown that our model is able to outperform several state-of-the-art baseline methods.","",""

Our approach leverages the labelindependent nature of self-supervised signals, and counters the adversarial perturbation with respect to the self-supervised tasks. SOAP yields competitive robust accuracy against state-of-the-art adversarial training and purification methods, with considerably less training complexity.

Overcoming catastrophic forgetting is of significant importance to emulate the process of ""incremental learning"", where the model is capable of learning from sequential experience in an efficient and robust way. State-of-the-art techniques for incremental learning make use of knowledge distillation towards preventing catastrophic forgetting. Therein, one updates the network while ensuring that the network’s responses to previously seen concepts remain stable throughout updates. This in practice is done by minimizing the dissimilarity between current and previous responses of the network one way or another. Our work contributes a novel method to the arsenal of distillation techniques. In contrast to the previous state of the art, we propose to firstly construct low-dimensional manifolds for previous and current responses and minimize the dissimilarity between the responses along the geodesic connecting the manifolds. This induces a more formidable knowledge distillation with smooth properties which preserves the past knowledge more efficiently as observed by our comprehensive empirical study. 1","",""

Existing state-of-the-art methods primarily adopt a sample selection strategy, which selects small-loss samples for subsequent training. However, prior literature tends to perform sample selection within each mini-batch, neglecting the imbalance of noise ratios in different mini-batches. Moreover, valuable knowledge within high-loss samples is wasted. To this end, we propose a noise-robust approach named Jo-SRC (Joint Sample Selection and Model Regularization based on Consistency). Specifically, we train the network in a contrastive learning manner. Predictions from two different views of each sample are used to estimate its ""likelihood"" of being clean or out-of-distribution. Furthermore, we propose a joint loss to advance the model generalization performance by introducing consistency regularization.

Previous studies explore to leverage architecture-level events disposed in hardware platforms to extract the model architecture information. They pose the following limitations: requiring a priori knowledge of victim models, lacking in robustness and generality, or obtaining incomplete information of the victim model architecture. Our paper proposes DeepSniffer, a learning-based model extraction framework to obtain the complete model architecture information without any prior knowledge of the victim model. It is robust to architectural and system noises introduced by the complex memory hierarchy and diverse run-time system optimizations. The basic idea of DeepSniffer is to learn the relation between extracted architectural hints (e.g., volumes of memory reads/writes obtained by side-channel or bus snooping attacks) and model internal architectures. Taking GPU platforms as a show case, DeepSniffer conducts model extraction by learning both the architecture-level execution features of kernels and the inter-layer temporal association information introduced by the common practice of DNN design. We demonstrate that DeepSniffer works experimentally in the context of an off-the-shelf Nvidia GPU platform running a variety of DNN models. The extracted models are directly helpful to the attempting of crafting adversarial inputs. Our experimental results show that DeepSniffer achieves a high accuracy of model extraction and thus improves the adversarial attack success rate from 14.6%$\sim$25.5% (without network architecture knowledge) to 75.9% (with extracted network architecture).
