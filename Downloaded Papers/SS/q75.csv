However, their robustness against adversarial attacks is criticized. Prior studies show that using unnoticeable modifications on graph topology or nodal features can significantly reduce the performances of GNNs. It is very challenging to design robust graph neural networks against poisoning attack and several efforts have been taken. Existing work aims at reducing the negative impact from adversarial edges only with the poisoned graph, which is sub-optimal since they fail to discriminate adversarial edges from normal ones. On the other hand, clean graphs from similar domains as the target poisoned graph are usually available in the real world. By perturbing these clean graphs, we create supervised knowledge to train the ability to detect adversarial edges so that the robustness of GNNs is elevated. However, such potential for clean graphs is neglected by existing work. To this end, we investigate a novel problem of improving the robustness of GNNs against poisoning attacks by exploring clean graphs. Specifically, we propose PA-GNN, which relies on a penalized aggregation mechanism that directly restrict the negative impact of adversarial edges by assigning them lower attention coefficients. To optimize PA-GNN for a poisoned graph, we design a meta-optimization algorithm that trains PA-GNN to penalize perturbations using clean graphs and their adversarial counterparts, and transfers such ability to improve the robustness of PA-GNN on the poisoned graph. Experimental results on four real-world datasets demonstrate the robustness of PA-GNN against poisoning attacks on graphs.","",""

To enhance learning ability of neural network models, the autoencoder method is used as a powerful tool to achieve deep learning and has gained success in recent years. However, the performance of existing autoencoder approaches for manipulator control may be still largely dependent on the quality of data, and for extreme cases with noisy data it may even fail. How to incorporate the model knowledge into the autoencoder controller design with an aim to increase the robustness and reliability remains a challenging problem. In this work, a sparse autoencoder controller for kinematic control of manipulators with weights obtained directly from the robot model rather than training data is proposed for the first time. By encoding and decoding the control target though a new dynamic recurrent neural network architecture, the control input can be solved through a new sparse optimization formulation. In this work, input saturation, which holds for almost all practical systems but usually is ignored for analysis simplicity, is also considered in the controller construction. Theoretical analysis and extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed sparse autoencoder controller with input saturation can make the end-effector of the manipulator system track the desired path efficiently. Further performance comparison and evaluation against the additive noise and parameter uncertainty substantiate robustness of the proposed sparse autoencoder manipulator controller.","",""

Brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) decode information from neural activity and send it to external devices. The use of Deep Learning approaches for decoding allows for automatic feature engineering within the specific decoding task. Physiologically plausible interpretation of the network parameters ensures the robustness of the learned decision rules and opens the exciting opportunity for automatic knowledge discovery. Approach. We describe a compact convolutional network-based architecture for adaptive decoding of electrocorticographic (ECoG) data into finger kinematics. We also propose a novel theoretically justified approach to interpreting the spatial and temporal weights in the architectures that combine adaptation in both space and time. The obtained spatial and frequency patterns characterizing the neuronal populations pivotal to the specific decoding task can then be interpreted by fitting appropriate spatial and dynamical models. Main results. We first tested our solution using realistic Monte-Carlo simulations. Then, when applied to the ECoG data from Berlin BCI competition IV dataset, our architecture performed comparably to the competition winners without requiring explicit feature engineering. Using the proposed approach to the network weights interpretation we could unravel the spatial and the spectral patterns of the neuronal processes underlying the successful decoding of finger kinematics from an ECoG dataset.

Yet, revealing the reaction pathways for complex systems and processes is still challenging because of the lack of knowledge of the involved species and reactions. Here, we present a neural network approach that autonomously discovers reaction pathways from the time-resolved species concentration data. The proposed chemical reaction neural network (CRNN), by design, satisfies the fundamental physics laws, including the law of mass action and the Arrhenius law. Consequently, the CRNN is physically interpretable such that the reaction pathways can be interpreted, and the kinetic parameters can be quantified simultaneously from the weights of the neural network. The inference of the chemical pathways is accomplished by training the CRNN with species concentration data via stochastic gradient descent. We demonstrate the successful implementations and the robustness of the approach in elucidating the chemical reaction pathways of several chemical engineering and biochemical systems. The autonomous inference by the CRNN approach precludes the need for expert knowledge in proposing candidate networks and addresses the curse of dimensionality in complex systems. The physical interpretability also makes the CRNN capable of not only fitting the data for a given system but also developing knowledge of unknown pathways that could be generalized to similar chemical systems.","",""

After introducing relevant terminology and the goals and range of possible knowledge of both attackers and defenders, we survey recent work on test-time evasion (TTE), data poisoning (DP), backdoor DP, and reverse engineering (RE) attacks and particularly defenses against the same. In so doing, we distinguish robust classification from anomaly detection (AD), unsupervised from supervised, and statistical hypothesis-based defenses from ones that do not have an explicit null (no attack) hypothesis. We also consider several scenarios for detecting backdoors. We provide a technical assessment for reviewed works, including identifying any issues/limitations, required hyperparameters, needed computational complexity, as well as the performance measures evaluated and the obtained quality. We then delve deeper, providing novel insights that challenge conventional AL wisdom and that target unresolved issues, including: robust classification versus AD as a defense strategy; the belief that attack success increases with attack strength, which ignores susceptibility to AD; small perturbations for TTE attacks: a fallacy or a requirement; validity of the universal assumption that a TTE attacker knows the ground-truth class for the example to be attacked; black, gray, or white-box attacks as the standard for defense evaluation; and susceptibility of query-based RE to an AD defense. We also discuss attacks on the privacy of training data. We then present benchmark comparisons of several defenses against TTE, RE, and backdoor DP attacks on images.

We outline how a noisy neural network has reduced learning capacity as a result of loss of mutual information between its input and output. To combat this, we propose using knowledge distillation combined with noise injection during training to achieve more noise robust networks, which is demonstrated experimentally across different networks and datasets, including ImageNet. Our method achieves models with as much as two times greater noise tolerance compared with the previous best attempts, which is a significant step towards making analog hardware practical for deep learning.","",""

A crucial requirement for this task is to effectively model the high-dimensional, noisy, and temporal electronic health record (EHR) data. Existing studies fulfill this requirement by applying recurrent neural networks with attention mechanisms, but facing data insufficiency and noise problem. Recently, more accurate and robust medical knowledge-guided methods have been proposed and have achieved superior performance. These methods inject the knowledge from a graph structure medical ontology into deep models via attention mechanisms to provide supplementary information of the input data. However, these methods only partially leverage the knowledge graph and neglect the global structure information, which is an important feature. To address this problem, we propose an end-to-end robust solution, namely Graph Neural Network-Based Diagnosis Prediction (GNDP). First, we propose to utilize the medical knowledge graph as an internal information of a patient by constructing sequential patient graphs. These graphs not only carry the historical information from the EHR but also infuse with domain knowledge. Then we design a robust diagnosis prediction model based on a spatial-temporal graph convolutional network. The proposed model extracts meaningful features from sequential graph EHR data effectively through multiple spatial-temporal graph convolution units to generate robust patients' representations for accurate diagnosis predictions. We evaluate the performance of GNDP against a set of state-of-the-art methods on two real-world medical data sets, the results demonstrate that our methods can achieve a better utilization of knowledge graph and improve the accuracy on diagnosis prediction tasks.","",""

In fact, the spatial distribution between objects from different classes has a strong correlation characteristic. For example, buildings tend to be close to roads. In view of the strong appearance extraction ability of DSSN and the powerful topological relationship modeling capability of the graph convolutional neural network (GCN), a DSSN-GCN framework, which combines the advantages of DSSN and GCN, is proposed in this paper for RS image semantic segmentation. To lift the appearance extraction ability, this paper proposes a new DSSN called the attention residual U-shaped network (AttResUNet), which leverages residual blocks to encode feature maps and the attention module to refine the features. As far as GCN, the graph is built, where graph nodes are denoted by the superpixels and the graph weight is calculated by considering the spectral information and spatial information of the nodes. The AttResUNet is trained to extract the high-level features to initialize the graph nodes. Then the GCN combines features and spatial relationships between nodes to conduct classification. It is worth noting that the usage of spatial relationship knowledge boosts the performance and robustness of the classification module. In addition, benefiting from modeling GCN on the superpixel level, the boundaries of objects are restored to a certain extent and there are less pixel-level noises in the final classification result. Extensive experiments on two publicly open datasets show that DSSN-GCN model outperforms the competitive baseline (i.e., the DSSN model) and the DSSN-GCN when adopting AttResUNet achieves the best performance, which demonstrates the advance of our method.","",""

In this paper, we propose a novel approach Neural Attentive model for cross-domain Aspect-level sentiment CLassification (NAACL), which leverages the benefits of the supervised deep neural network as well as the unsupervised probabilistic generative model to strengthen the representation learning. NAACL jointly learns two tasks: (i) a domain classifier, working on documents in both the source and target domains to recognize the domain information of input texts and transfer knowledge from the source domain to the target domain. In particular, a weakly supervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation model (wsLDA) is proposed to learn the domain-specific aspect and sentiment lexicon representations that are then used to calculate the aspect/lexicon-aware document representations via a multi-view attention mechanism; (ii) an aspect-level sentiment classifier, sharing the document modeling with the domain classifier.

NAACL is evaluated on both English and Chinese datasets with the out-of-domain as well as in-domain setups. Quantitatively, the experiments demonstrate that NAACL has robust superiority over the compared methods in terms of classification accuracy and F1 score.

Traditionally, rule-based and model-based approaches such as linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) have been used for scheduling HVAC. However, the system complexity of HVAC and the dynamism in the building environment limit the accuracy, efficiency and robustness of such methods. Recently, several works have focused on model-free deep reinforcement learning based techniques such as Deep Q-Network (DQN). Such methods require extensive interactions with the environment. Thus, they are impractical to implement in real systems due to low sample efficiency. Safety-aware exploration is another challenge in real systems since certain actions at particular states may result in catastrophic outcomes.

In recent years, deep neural networks have achieved promising results in medical image segmentation and have been brought into vein verification, but current solutions suffer from two challenges for vein segmentation: 1) lacking the labeling data, which is expensive to obtain and 2) the incorrect label data obtained by manual labeling scheme or automatic labeling scheme may strongly influence parameters when the network is trained, which may degrade the verification performance.

First, a known handcrafted vein image segmentation technique is employed to automatically label vein pixel and background pixel. A training dataset is constructed based on the patches centered on the labeled pixels. Second, a DBN is trained on the resulting database to predict the probability of each pixel to belong to be a vein pixel given a patch centered on it. The vein patterns are segmented using a probability threshold of 0.5. The resulting vein features are employed to reconstruct the training dataset, based on which the network is retrained. During the iterative procedure, the incorrect labels of training data are statistically corrected, which enables DBN to effectively learn what a finger-vein pattern is by learning the difference between vein patterns and background ones.

In this article, inspired by the mechanisms of the motor cortex in encoding information and modulating motor commands, a biologically plausible gain-modulated recurrent neural network is proposed to control a highly redundant, coupled, and nonlinear musculoskeletal robot. As the characteristics observed in the motor cortex, this network is able to learn gain patterns for arousing transient responses to complete the desired movements, while the connections of synapses keep unchanged, and the dynamic stability of the network is maintained. A novel learning rule that mimics the mechanism of neuromodulators in regulating the learning process of the brain is put forward to learn gain patterns effectively. Meanwhile, inspired by error-based movement correction mechanism in the cerebellum, gain patterns learned from demonstration samples are leveraged as prior knowledge to improve calculation efficiency of the network in controlling novel movements. Experiments were conducted on an upper extremity musculoskeletal model with 11 muscles and a general articulated robot to perform goal-directed tasks. The results indicate that the gain-modulated neural network can effectively control a complex robot to complete various movements with high accuracy, and the proposed algorithms make it possible to realize fast generalization and incremental learning ability.","",""

Although many works study text classification under the adversarial threat, to the best of our knowledge, we do not find any work in literature that specifically analyzes the performance of DL-based fake-news detectors under adversarial settings.

In DNN-based acoustic models, various regularizations have been proposed to improve robustness. However, most approaches do not handle speech generation knowledge even if this process is the most fundamental prior. For example, l1 and l2-norm regularizations are equivalent to set Gaussian prior and Laplacian prior to model parameters respectively. This means that any speech signal specific knowledge is not used for regularization. Manifold-based regularization exploits the local linear structure of observed acoustic features, which are simply realization of the speech generation process.

Therefore, it is of great importance to develop methods that can automatically learn general and robust features for image operation detectors with the capability of countering anti-forensics. In this paper, we propose a new convolutional neural network (CNN) approach for multi-purpose detection of image manipulations under anti-forensic attacks. The dense connectivity pattern, which has better parameter efficiency than the traditional pattern, is explored to strengthen the propagation of general features related to image manipulation detection. When compared with three state-of-the-art methods, experiments demonstrate that the proposed CNN architecture can achieve a better performance (i.e., with a 11% improvement in terms of detection accuracy under anti-forensic attacks). The proposed method can also achieve better robustness against JPEG compression with maximum improvement of 13% on accuracy under low-quality JPEG compression.","",""

In many applications, feed-forward neural networks are heavily involved in the implementation of controllers by learning and representing control laws through several methods such as model predictive control (MPC) and reinforcement learning (RL). The type of networks that we consider in this manuscript are feed-forward neural networks consisting of multiple hidden layers with ReLU activation functions and a linear activation function in the output layer. While neural network controllers have been able to achieve desirable performance in many contexts, they also present a unique challenge in that it is difficult to provide any guarantees about the correctness of their behavior or reason about the stability a system that employs their use. Thus, from a controls perspective, it is necessary to verify them in conjunction with their corresponding plants in closed-loop. While there have been a handful of works proposed towards the verification of closed-loop systems with feed-forward neural network controllers, this area still lacks attention and a unified set of benchmark examples on which verification techniques can be evaluated and compared. Thus, to this end, we present a range of closed-loop control systems ranging from two to six state variables, and a range of controllers with sizes in the range of eleven neurons to a few hundred neurons in more complex systems.

In recent years, advances in Artficial Intelligence (AI) have enabled a diverse range of technologies that are directly impacting people’s everyday lives [16]. Particularly, within this space, machine learning methods such as Deep Learning (DL) have achieved levels of accuracy and performance that are competitive or better than humans for tasks such as pattern and image recognition [12], natural language processing [7], and knowledge representation and reasoning [15,22]. Despite these achievements, there have been reservations about incorporating them into safety critical systems [11] due to their susceptibility to unexpected and errant behavior from a slight perturbation in their inputs [18]. Furthermore, neural networks are often viewed as ""black boxes"" since the underlying operation of the neuron activations is often indiscernible [22]. In light of these challenges, there has been significant work towards the creation of methods and verification tools that can formally reason about the behavior of neural networks [22]. However, the vast majority of these techniques have only been able to deal with feed-forward neural networks with piecewise-linear activation functions [4]. Additionally, the bulk of these methods have primarily considered the verification of input-output properties of neural networks in isolation [22], and there are only a handful of works that have explicitly addressed the verification of closed-loop control systems with neural network controllers [5, 8, 19–21]. One of the central challenges in verifying neural network control systems is that applying existing methodology to these systems is not straightforward [9], and a simple combination of verification tools for non-linear ordinary differential equations along with a neural network reachability tool suffers from severe overestimation errors [5]. Still, the verification of closed loop neural network systems is deeply important as they naturally arise in safety critical systems [5] such as autonomous vehicles, and complex control systems that make use of model predictive control and reinforcement learning [16]. Thus, there is a compelling need for methods and advanced software tools that can effectively deal with the complexities exhibited by these systems [5]. Inspired by a shortage of verification methods for closed-loop neural network control systems in the research literature, the central contribution of this paper is the provision of a set of executable benchmarks that have been synthesized using methods such as reinforcement learning [17], and model predictive control [14]. The problems elucidated in the paper are modeled using Simulink/Stateflow (SLSF) and are available at the following github repository1. We aim to provide a thorough problem description to which the numerous tools and approaches for non-linear systems and neural network verification present in the research community can be evaluated and compared [22]. If the research community is able to devise acceptable solutions to the aformentioned challenges they will stimulate the development of robust and intelligent systems with the potential to bring unparalleled benefits to numerous application domains. 2 Description of benchmarks.

The simulation study demonstrates that NN-SPID continuously adapts the tuning parameters, achieving lower fluctuations than GA-SPID in the allocation process. As a consequence, it provides a more stable response than GA-SPID since it needs to launch the GA to obtain new tuning values. Furthermore, NN-SPID guarantees the minimum bandwidth levels faster than GA-SPID.

Motivated by the need to assess the probability of fatality when conducting field work, we have worked closely with the New Zealand volcano monitoring team to explore the potential utility of BNs. We adapted a previously published BN for a pilot study to forecast volcanic eruption on Whakaari/White Island. Developing the model structure provided a useful framework for the members of the volcano monitoring team to share their knowledge and interpretation of the volcanic system. We aimed to capture the conceptual understanding of the volcanic processes and represent all observables that are regularly monitored. The pilot model has a total of 30 variables, four of them describing the volcanic processes that can lead to three different types of eruptions: phreatic, magmatic explosive and magmatic effusive. The remaining 23 variables are grouped into observations related to seismicity, fluid geochemistry and surface manifestations. To estimate the model parameters, we held a workshop with eleven experts, including two from outside the monitoring team. To reduce the number of conditional probabilities that the experts needed to estimate, each variable is described by only two states. However, experts were concerned about this limitation, in particular for continuous data. Therefore, they were reluctant to define thresholds to distinguish between states. We conclude that volcano monitoring requires BN modeling techniques that can accommodate continuous variables. More work is required to link unobservable (latent) processes with observables and with eruptive patterns, and to model dynamic processes. A provisional application of the pilot model revealed several key insights. Refining the BN modeling techniques will help advance understanding of volcanoes and improve capabilities for forecasting volcanic eruptions. We consider that BNs will become essential for handling ever-burgeoning observations, and for assessing data’s evidential meaning for operational eruption forecasting.","",""

It can even memorize randomly labeled data, which has little knowledge behind the instance-label pairs. When a deep network continually learns over time by accommodating new tasks, it usually quickly overwrites the knowledge learned from previous tasks. Referred to as the neural variability, it is well known in neuroscience that human brain reactions exhibit substantial variability even in response to the same stimulus. This mechanism balances accuracy and plasticity/flexibility in the motor learning of natural nervous systems. Thus, it motivates us to design a similar mechanism, named artificial neural variability (ANV), that helps artificial neural networks learn some advantages from “natural” neural networks. We rigorously prove that ANV plays as an implicit regularizer of the mutual information between the training data and the learned model. This result theoretically guarantees ANV a strictly improved generalizability, robustness to label noise, and robustness to catastrophic forgetting. We then devise a neural variable risk minimization (NVRM) framework and neural variable optimizers to achieve ANV for conventional network architectures in practice. The empirical studies demonstrate that NVRM can effectively relieve overfitting, label noise memorization, and catastrophic forgetting at negligible costs.","",""

This tends to limit their effectiveness on small models, which are more preferable in scenarios where storage or computing resources are very limited (e.g., mobile devices). In this paper, we leverage the concept of knowledge distillation to improve the robustness of small models by distilling from adversarially trained large models. We first revisit several state-of-the-art AT methods from a distillation perspective and identify one common technique that can lead to improved robustness: the use of robust soft labels – predictions of a robust model. Following this observation, we propose a novel adversarial robustness distillation method called Robust Soft Label Adversarial Distillation (RSLAD) to train robust small student models. RSLAD fully exploits the robust soft labels produced by a robust (adversarially-trained) large teacher model to guide the student’s learning on both natural and adversarial examples in all loss terms. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our RSLAD approach over existing adversarial training and distillation methods in improving the robustness of small models against state-of-the-art attacks including the AutoAttack.

The robustness of existing defenses suffers greatly under white-box attack settings, where an adversary has full knowledge about the network and can iterate several times to find strong perturbations. We observe that the main reason for the existence of such perturbations is the close proximity of different class samples in the learned feature space. This allows model decisions to be totally changed by adding an imperceptible perturbation in the inputs. To counter this, we propose to class-wise disentangle the intermediate feature representations of deep networks. Specifically, we force the features for each class to lie inside a convex polytope that is maximally separated from the polytopes of other classes. In this manner, the network is forced to learn distinct and distant decision regions for each class. We observe that this simple constraint on the features greatly enhances the robustness of learned models, even against the strongest white-box attacks, without degrading the classification performance on clean images.

Computational Intelligence (CI) techniques cans be applied to these scenarios to predict the required RF power in the available channels to achieve optimum Quality of Service (QoS). In this paper, we developed a time domain based optimized Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) models for the prediction of real world RF power within the GSM 900, Very High Frequency (VHF) and Ultra High Frequency (UHF) FM and TV bands. Sensitivity analysis was used to reduce the input vector of the prediction models. The inputs of the ANN and SVR consist of only time domain data and past RF power without using any RF power related parameters, thus forming a nonlinear time series prediction model. The application of the models produced was found to increase the robustness of CR applications, specifically where the CR had no prior knowledge of the RF power related parameters such as signal to noise ratio, bandwidth and bit error rate. Since CR are embedded communication devices with memory constrain limitation, the models used, implemented a novel and innovative initial weight optimization of the ANN's through the use of compact differential evolutionary (cDE) algorithm variants which are memory efficient. This was found to enhance the accuracy and generalization of the ANN model.","",""

We propose a quantitative evaluation metric of the learned representation that uses nearest neighbors in the state space and allows to assess its quality and show both the potential and limitations of robotic priors in realistic environments. We augment image size, add distractors and domain randomization, all crucial components to achieve transfer learning to real robots.

The perceptual threat model is broad and encompasses $L_2$, $L_\infty$, spatial, and many other existing adversarial threat models. However, it is difficult to determine if an arbitrary perturbation is imperceptible without humans in the loop. To solve this issue, we propose to use a {\it neural perceptual distance}, an approximation of the true perceptual distance between images using internal activations of neural networks. In particular, we use the Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) distance. We then propose the {\it neural perceptual threat model} that includes adversarial examples with a bounded neural perceptual distance to natural images. Under the neural perceptual threat model, we develop two novel perceptual adversarial attacks to find any imperceptible perturbations to images which can fool a classifier. Through an extensive perceptual study, we show that the LPIPS distance correlates well with human judgements of perceptibility of adversarial examples, validating our threat model. Because the LPIPS threat model is very broad, we find that Perceptual Adversarial Training (PAT) against a perceptual attack gives robustness against many other types of adversarial attacks. We test PAT on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-100 against 12 types of adversarial attacks and find that, for each attack, PAT achieves close to the accuracy of adversarial training against just that perturbation type. That is, PAT generalizes well to unforeseen perturbation types. This is vital in sensitive applications where a particular threat model cannot be assumed, and to the best of our knowledge, PAT is the first adversarial defense with this property.","",""

Some methods replace the one-way knowledge distillation from a static teacher with collaborative learning between a cohort of students. Despite the recent advances, a clear understanding of where knowledge resides in a deep neural network and an optimal method for capturing knowledge from teacher and transferring it to student remains an open question.

We demonstrate the versatility of the KD framework on different datasets and network architectures under varying capacity gaps between the teacher and student. The study provides intuition for the effects of mimicking different aspects of the teacher and derives insights from the performance of the different distillation approaches to guide the design of more effective KD methods. Furthermore, our study shows the effectiveness of the KD framework in learning efficiently under varying severity levels of label noise and class imbalance, consistently providing generalization gains over standard training.

This problem can be solved by applying the existing compressed sensing techniques, which however either suffer from high computational complexities or lack of algorithm robustness. To this end, we propose a novel algorithm unrolling framework based on the deep neural network to simultaneously achieve low computational complexity and high robustness for solving the JADCE problem.

Moreover, the proposed algorithm unrolling approach inherits the structure and domain knowledge of the ISTA, thereby maintaining the algorithm robustness, which can handle non-Gaussian preamble sequence matrix in massive access. With rigorous theoretical analysis, we further simplify the unrolled network structure by reducing the redundant training parameters. Furthermore, we prove that the simplified unrolled deep neural network structures enjoy a linear convergence rate. Extensive simulations based on various preamble signatures show that the proposed unrolled networks outperform the existing methods in terms of the convergence rate, robustness and estimation accuracy.","",""

There is also debate about the relationship between semantic and executive control more widely. We used TMS in healthy human volunteers to create “virtual lesions” in structures typically damaged in patients with semantic control deficits: LIFG, left posterior middle temporal gyrus (pMTG), and intraparietal sulcus (IPS). The influence of TMS on tasks varying in semantic and nonsemantic control demands was examined for each region within this hypothesized network to gain insights into (i) their functional specialization (i.e., involvement in semantic representation, controlled retrieval, or selection) and (ii) their domain dependence (i.e., semantic or cognitive control). The results revealed that LIFG and pMTG jointly support both the controlled retrieval and selection of semantic knowledge.

The Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are used to solve a number of scientific problems. It has the capability to approximate any continuous non-linear function to arbitrary accuracy [10]. A multi-layer feed-forward neural network can approximate a continuous function due to its robustness, parallel architecture and fault tolerance capability. In past years, ANN models are used by a number of researchers to estimate solar radiation [11–15] and concluded that ANN model are proven to be superior to other empirical regression models. Reddy [11] used Radial Basis Functions (RBF) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models to predict solar radiation using data from eight stations in Oman.

Measurements provided by the PCXD, however, are distorted due to undesirable physical effects in the detector and can be very noisy due to photon starvation in narrow energy bins. To address spectral distortions, we propose and demonstrate a novel artificial neural network (ANN)-based spectral distortion correction mechanism, which learns to undo the distortion in spectral CT, resulting in improved material decomposition accuracy. To address noise, post-reconstruction denoising based on bilateral filtration, which jointly enforces intensity gradient sparsity between spectral samples, is used to further improve the robustness of ANN training and material decomposition accuracy. Our ANN-based distortion correction method is calibrated using 3D-printed phantoms and a model of our spectral CT system. To enable realistic simulations and validation of our method, we first modeled the spectral distortions using experimental data acquired from (109)Cd and (133)Ba radioactive sources measured with our PCXD. Next, we trained an ANN to learn the relationship between the distorted spectral CT projections and the ideal, distortion-free projections in a calibration step. This required knowledge of the ground truth, distortion-free spectral CT projections, which were obtained by simulating a spectral CT scan of the digital version of a 3D-printed phantom. Once the training was completed, the trained ANN was used to perform distortion correction on any subsequent scans of the same system with the same parameters. We used joint bilateral filtration to perform noise reduction by jointly enforcing intensity gradient sparsity between the reconstructed images for each energy bin. Following reconstruction and denoising, the CT data was spectrally decomposed using the photoelectric effect, Compton scattering, and a K-edge material (i.e. iodine). The ANN-based distortion correction approach was tested using both simulations and experimental data acquired in phantoms and a mouse with our PCXD-based micro-CT system for 4 bins and full-spectrum acquisition modes. The iodine detectability and decomposition accuracy were assessed using the contrast-to-noise ratio and relative error in iodine concentration estimation metrics in images with and without distortion correction. In simulation, the material decomposition accuracy in the reconstructed data was vastly improved following distortion correction and denoising, with 50% and 20% reductions in material concentration measurement error in full-spectrum and 4 energy bins cases, respectively. Overall, experimental data confirms that full-spectrum mode provides superior results to 4-energy mode when the distortion corrections are applied. The material decomposition accuracy in the reconstructed data was vastly improved following distortion correction and denoising, with as much as a 41% reduction in material concentration measurement error for full-spectrum mode, while also bringing the iodine detectability to 4-6 mg ml(-1). Distortion correction also improved the 4 bins mode data, but to a lesser extent. The results demonstrate the experimental feasibility and potential advantages of ANN-based distortion correction and joint bilateral filtration-based denoising for accurate K-edge imaging with a PCXD. Given the computational efficiency with which the ANN can be applied to projection data, the proposed scheme can be readily integrated into existing CT reconstruction pipelines.","",""

Specifically, the workflow consists of two components: (1) seismic feature self-learning (SFSL) and (2) stratigraphy model building (SMB), each of which is formulated as a deep CNN. Whereas the SMB is supervised by knowledge from domain experts and the associated CNN uses a similar network architecture typically used in image segmentation, the SFSL is designed as an unsupervised process and thus can be performed backstage while an expert prepares the training labels for the SMB CNN. Compared with conventional approaches, the our workflow is superior in two aspects. First, the SMB CNN, initialized by the SFSL CNN, successfully inherits the prior knowledge of the seismic features in the target seismic data. Therefore, it becomes feasible for completing the supervised training of the SMBCNNmore efficiently using only a small amount of training data, for example, less than 0.1% of the available seismic data as demonstrated in this paper. Second, for the convenience of seismic experts in translating their domain knowledge into training labels, our workflow is designed to be applicable to three scenarios, trace-wise, paintbrushing, and full-sectional annotation. The performance of the new workflow is well-verified through application to three real seismic data sets.

Finally, this method is evaluated on challenging indoor data sets collected from motion capture system. The results show that the relocalization performance is hardly affected by dynamic objects, motion blur, or night-time environments.Note to Practitioners—This paper was motivated by the limitations of the existing indoor relocalization technology that is significant for mobile robot navigation. Using this technology, robots can infer where they are in a previously visited place. Previous visual localization methods can hardly be put into wide application for the reason that they have strict requirements for the environments.

The distillation loss determines how a teacher's knowledge is captured and transferred to the student. In this paper, we propose a new form of knowledge distillation loss that is inspired by the observation that semantically similar inputs tend to elicit similar activation patterns in a trained network. Similarity-preserving knowledge distillation guides the training of a student network such that input pairs that produce similar (dissimilar) activations in the teacher network produce similar (dissimilar) activations in the student network.

In addition, it reduces the storage and computation requirements of deep neural networks (DNNs) and accelerates the inference process dramatically. Existing methods mainly rely on manual constraints such as normalization to select the filters. A typical pipeline comprises two stages: first pruning the original neural network and then fine-tuning the pruned model. However, choosing a manual criterion can be somehow tricky and stochastic. Moreover, directly regularizing and modifying filters in the pipeline suffer from being sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters, thus making the pruning procedure less robust. To address these challenges, we propose to handle the filter pruning issue through one stage: using an attention-based architecture that adaptively fuses the filter selection with filter learning in a unified network. Specifically, we present a pruning method named adding before pruning (ABP) to make the model focus on the filters of higher significance by training instead of man-made criteria such as norm, rank, etc. First, we add an auxiliary attention layer into the original model and set the significance scores in this layer to be binary. Furthermore, to propagate the gradients in the auxiliary attention layer, we design a specific gradient estimator and prove its effectiveness for convergence in the graph flow through mathematical derivation. In the end, to relieve the dependence on the complicated prior knowledge for designing the thresholding criterion, we simultaneously prune and train the filters to automatically eliminate network redundancy with recoverability. Extensive experimental results on the two typical image classification benchmarks, CIFAR-10 and ILSVRC-2012, illustrate that the proposed approach performs favorably against previous state-of-the-art filter pruning algorithms.","",""

While some proposals have suggested the two phenomena are linked, behavioral priming has been observed many years after initial exposure, whereas RS is widely considered a transitory phenomenon. This raises the question: what is the true upper limit of RS persistence? To answer this question, we scanned healthy, English-native adults with fMRI as they viewed novel (Asian) proverbs, recently repeated (Asian) proverbs, and previously known (English) proverbs that were matched on various dimensions. We then estimated RS by comparing repeated or previously known proverbs against novel ones. Multivariate analyses linked previously known and repeated proverbs with statistically indistinguishable RS in a broad visual-linguistic network. In each suppressed region, prior knowledge and repetition also induced a common shift in functional connectivity, further underscoring the similarity of the RS phenomenon induced by these conditions. By contrast, activated regions readily distinguished prior knowledge and repetition conditions in a manner consistent with engagement of semantic and episodic memory systems, respectively. Our results illustrate that regardless of whether RS is understood in terms of its magnitude, spatial extent or functional connectivity profile, typical RS effects can be elicited even under conditions where recently triggered biological processes or episodic memory are unlikely to play a prominent role. These results provide important new evidence that RS (of the kind observed after an interval of at least several minutes) reflects the facilitation of perceptual and comprehension processes by any type of information retrieved from long-term memory.","",""

From the knowledge-based view, the tasks’ execution time calculation component uses the BP neural network to predict tasks’ execution time according to the previous similar tasks and the Task–Knowledge–Person (TKP) network. When constructing the BP neural network, the satisfaction degree of knowledge and the execution time are set as the input and output, respectively. Considering the uncertain factors associated with the whole R&D process, the task assignment model component serves as a robust optimization model to assign tasks. Then, an improved genetic algorithm is developed to solve the task assignment model. Finally, the results of numerical experiment are reported to validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.","",""

Do these two sets of processes rely on distinct, specialized mechanisms or, rather, share a common pool of resources? Linguistic theorizing, empirical evidence from language acquisition and processing, and computational modeling have jointly painted a picture whereby lexico-semantic and syntactic processing are deeply inter-connected and perhaps not separable. In contrast, many current proposals of the neural architecture of language continue to endorse a view whereby certain brain regions selectively support syntactic/combinatorial processing, although the locus of such ""syntactic hub"", and its nature, vary across proposals. Here, we searched for selectivity for syntactic over lexico-semantic processing using a powerful individual-subjects fMRI approach across three sentence comprehension paradigms that have been used in prior work to argue for such selectivity: responses to lexico-semantic vs. morpho-syntactic violations (Experiment 1); recovery from neural suppression across pairs of sentences differing in only lexical items vs. only syntactic structure (Experiment 2); and same/different meaning judgments on such sentence pairs (Experiment 3). Across experiments, both lexico-semantic and syntactic conditions elicited robust responses throughout the left fronto-temporal language network. Critically, however, no regions were more strongly engaged by syntactic than lexico-semantic processing, although some regions showed the opposite pattern. Thus, contra many current proposals of the neural architecture of language, syntactic/combinatorial processing is not separable from lexico-semantic processing at the level of brain regions-or even voxel subsets-within the language network, in line with strong integration between these two processes that has been consistently observed in behavioral and computational language research. The results further suggest that the language network may be generally more strongly concerned with meaning than syntactic form, in line with the primary function of language-to share meanings across minds.","",""

With the evolution of deep learning in computer vision, emotion recognition has become a widely-tackled research problem. In this work, we propose two independent methods for this very task. The first method uses autoencoders to construct a unique representation of each emotion, while the second method is an 8-layer convolutional neural network (CNN). These methods were trained on the posed-emotion dataset (JAFFE), and to test their robustness, both the models were also tested on 100 random images from the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset, which consists of images that are candid than posed. The results show that with more fine-tuning and depth, our CNN model can outperform the state-of-the-art methods for emotion recognition. We also propose some exciting ideas for expanding the concept of representational autoencoders to improve their performance.","",""

Prior efforts mostly focus on incorporating side information to achieve better recommendation performance. However, these methods have some weaknesses: (1) prediction of neural network-based embedding methods are hard to explain and debug; (2) symbolic, graph-based approaches (e.g., meta path-based models) require manual efforts and domain knowledge to define patterns and rules, and ignore the item association types (e.g. substitutable and complementary). In this paper, we propose a novel joint learning framework to integrate induction of explainable rules from knowledge graph with construction of a rule-guided neural recommendation model. The framework encourages two modules to complement each other in generating effective and explainable recommendation: 1) inductive rules, mined from item-centric knowledge graphs, summarize common multi-hop relational patterns for inferring different item associations and provide human-readable explanation for model prediction; 2) recommendation module can be augmented by induced rules and thus have better generalization ability dealing with the cold-start issue. Extensive experiments1 show that our proposed method has achieved significant improvements in item recommendation over baselines on real-world datasets. Our model demonstrates robust performance over “noisy” item knowledge graphs, generated by linking item names to related entities.","",""

However, as demonstrated in recent literature, when tested on some simple adversarial examples, most of the models suffer a significant drop in performance. This raises the concern about the robustness of NLI models. In this paper, we propose to make NLI models robust by incorporating external knowledge to the attention mechanism using a simple transformation. We apply the new attention to two popular types of NLI models: one is Transformer encoder, and the other is a decomposable model, and show that our method can significantly improve their robustness. Moreover, when combined with BERT pretraining, our method achieves the human-level performance on the adversarial SNLI data set.","",""

A promising alternative is to fine-tune a CNN that has been pre-trained using, for instance, a large set of labeled natural images. However, the substantial differences between natural and medical images may advise against such knowledge transfer. In this paper, we seek to answer the following central question in the context of medical image analysis: Can the use of pre-trained deep CNNs with sufficient fine-tuning eliminate the need for training a deep CNN from scratch? To address this question, we considered four distinct medical imaging applications in three specialties (radiology, cardiology, and gastroenterology) involving classification, detection, and segmentation from three different imaging modalities, and investigated how the performance of deep CNNs trained from scratch compared with the pre-trained CNNs fine-tuned in a layer-wise manner. Our experiments consistently demonstrated that 1) the use of a pre-trained CNN with adequate fine-tuning outperformed or, in the worst case, performed as well as a CNN trained from scratch; 2) fine-tuned CNNs were more robust to the size of training sets than CNNs trained from scratch; 3) neither shallow tuning nor deep tuning was the optimal choice for a particular application; and 4) our layer-wise fine-tuning scheme could offer a practical way to reach the best performance for the application at hand based on the amount of available data.","",""

In our work, we use a neural network to directly get a mapping function of received signals, channel matrix and transmitted bit streams. Then, we compare the end-to-end approach using deep learning with the conventional methods in possession of perfect channel knowledge and imperfect channel knowledge. Simulation results show that our method presents a better trade-off in the performance for accuracy versus decoding complexity. At the same time, better robustness can be achieved in condition of imperfect channel knowledge compared with conventional algorithms.","",""

Extensive research in the field suggests many different quantization schemes. Still, the number of bits required, as well as the best quantization scheme, are yet unknown. Our theoretical analysis suggests that most of the training process is robust to substantial precision reduction, and points to only a few specific operations that require higher precision. Armed with this knowledge, we quantize the model parameters, activations and layer gradients to 8-bit, leaving at a higher precision only the final step in the computation of the weight gradients. Additionally, as QNNs require batch-normalization to be trained at high precision, we introduce Range Batch-Normalization (BN) which has significantly higher tolerance to quantization noise and improved computational complexity. Our simulations show that Range BN is equivalent to the traditional batch norm if a precise scale adjustment, which can be approximated analytically, is applied. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this work is the first to quantize the weights, activations, as well as a substantial volume of the gradients stream, in all layers (including batch normalization) to 8-bit while showing state-of-the-art results over the ImageNet-1K dataset.","",""
