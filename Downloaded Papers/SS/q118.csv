However, the behaviour of such optimisation has not been studied in the light of a fundamentally different class of attacks called backdoors. In this paper, we demonstrate that adversarially robust models are susceptible to backdoor attacks. Subsequently, we observe that backdoors are reflected in the feature representation of such models. Then, this observation is leveraged to detect backdoor-infected models via a detection technique called AEGIS. Specifically, AEGIS uses feature clustering to effectively detect backdoor-infected robust Deep Neural Networks (DNNs).  In our evaluation of major classification tasks using CIFAR-10, MNIST and FMNIST datasets, AEGIS effectively detects robust DNNs infected with backdoors. Overall, AEGIS has 97% (70/72) detection accuracy and 0.3% (2/648) false positive rate, for all configurations. Our investigation reveals that salient features of adversarially robust DNNs break the stealthy nature of backdoor attacks.","",""

All new descriptors closely resemble the helium atom void fraction of the material framework. However, instead of a helium atom, a particle with an appropriately defined van der Waals radius is used. The set of void fractions of a small number of these particles is found to be sufficient to characterize uniquely the structure of each material and to account for the most important topological features. We assess the accuracy of our approach by examining the predictions of the random forest algorithm in the relative small dataset of the computation-ready, experimental (CoRE) MOFs (∼4700 structures) that have been experimentally synthesized and whose geometrical/structural features have been accurately calculated before. We first performed grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations to accurately determine their methane uptake capacities at two different temperatures (280 and 298 K) and three different pressures (1, 5.8, and 65 bar). Despite the high chemical and structural diversity of the CoRE MOFs, it was found that the use of the proposed descriptors significantly improves the accuracy of the machine learning algorithm, particularly at low pressures, compared to the predictions made based solely on the rest structural features. More importantly, the algorithm can be easily adapted for other types of nanoporous materials beyond MOFs. Convergence of the predictions was reached even for small training set sizes compared to what was found in previous works using the hypothetical MOF database.","",""

Conventional econometric methods fail to capture efficiently the information contained in the full spectrum of the datasets. To address these challenges, in this work we investigate the analysis of a corporate credit loans big dataset using cutting edge machine learning techniques and deep learning neural networks. The novelty of our approach lies in the combination of a data mining algorithms that aim to reduce dimensionality in the data and increase accuracy in predicting the future behaviour of corporate loans, to facilitate a more effective micro and macro supervision of credit risk in the Greek banking system. Our analysis is based on a large dataset of loan level data, spanning a 10 year period of the Greek economy with the purpose of performing obligor credit quality classification and quantification of Probability of Default under a through the cycle setup. We perform extensive comparisons of the classification and forecasting accuracy of the proposed methods, using a 3-years’ period out-of-time sample. Our experimental results are benchmarked against other traditional methods, like logistic regression and discriminant analysis methods, yielding significantly superior performance. In the final stage of our analysis, a robust through the cycle financial credit rating is developed which can offer a proactive monitoring mechanism of the credit risk dynamics in a financial system.

Yet, the question is whether a Byzantine-resilient aggregation can leverage more workers to speedup learning. We answer this theoretical question, and implement these state-of-the-art theoretical approaches on AGGREGATHOR, to assess their practical costs. We built AGGREGATHOR around TensorFlow and introduce modifications for vanilla TensorFlow towards making it usable in an actual Byzantine setting. AGGREGATHOR also permits the use of unreliable gradient transfer over UDP to provide further speed-up (without losing the accuracy) over the native communication protocols (TCP-based) of TensorFlow in saturated networks.

Herein the authors propose the concept of first‐principles multiscale modeling of mechanical properties, where ab initio level of accuracy is hierarchically bridged to explore the mechanical/failure response of macroscopic systems. It is demonstrated that machine‐learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) fitted to ab initio datasets play a pivotal role in achieving this goal. To practically illustrate this novel possibility, the mechanical/failure response of graphene/borophene coplanar heterostructures is examined. It is shown that MLIPs conveniently outperform popular CMD models for graphene and borophene and they can evaluate the mechanical properties of pristine and heterostructure phases at room temperature. Based on the information provided by the MLIP‐based CMD, continuum models of heterostructures using the finite element method can be constructed. The study highlights that MLIPs were the missing block for conducting first‐principles multiscale modeling, and their employment empowers a straightforward route to bridge ab initio level accuracy and flexibility to explore the mechanical/failure response of nanostructures at continuum scale.","",""

Such high dimensionality of datasets poses a significant challenge to information extraction in terms of time and space complexity. Moreover, having so many attributes may be a hindrance towards creation of a decision boundary due to noise in the dataset. Large scale data with redundant or insignificant features increases the computational time and often decreases goodness of fit which is a critical issue in cybersecurity. In this research, we have proposed and implemented an efficient feature selection algorithm to filter insignificant variables. Our proposed Dynamic Feature Selector (DFS) uses statistical analysis and feature importance tests to reduce model complexity and improve prediction accuracy. To evaluate DFS, we conducted experiments on two datasets used for cybersecurity research namely Network Security Laboratory (NSL-KDD) and University of New South Wales (UNSW-NB15). In the meta-learning stage, four algorithms were compared namely Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM), Gated Recurrent Units, Random Forest and a proposed Convolutional Neural Network and Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) for accuracy estimation. For NSL-KDD, experiments revealed an increment in accuracy from 99.54% to 99.64% while reducing feature size of one-hot encoded features from 123 to 50. In UNSW-NB15 we observed an increase in accuracy from 90.98% to 92.46% while reducing feature size from 196 to 47. The proposed approach is thus able to achieve higher accuracy while significantly lowering number of features required for processing.","",""

It plays a vital role in various machine learning applications and has attracted tremendous attention across different communities recently. In this paper, we explore different adversarial scenarios in the context of quantum machine learning. We find that, similar to traditional classifiers based on classical neural networks, quantum learning systems are likewise vulnerable to crafted adversarial examples, independent of whether the input data is classical or quantum. In particular, we find that a quantum classifier that achieves nearly the state-of-the-art accuracy can be conclusively deceived by adversarial examples obtained via adding imperceptible perturbations to the original legitimate samples. This is explicitly demonstrated with quantum adversarial learning in different scenarios, including classifying real-life images (e.g., handwritten digit images in the dataset MNIST), learning phases of matter (such as, ferromagnetic/paramagnetic orders and symmetry protected topological phases), and classifying quantum data. Furthermore, we show that based on the information of the adversarial examples at hand, practical defense strategies can be designed to fight against a number of different attacks. Our results uncover the notable vulnerability of quantum machine learning systems to adversarial perturbations, which not only reveals a novel perspective in bridging machine learning and quantum physics in theory but also provides valuable guidance for practical applications of quantum classifiers based on both near-term and future quantum technologies.","",""

The method exploits advantages in domain knowledge and machine learning as complementary information sources. Whereas machine learning may discover patterns in interest domains that are too subtle for humans to detect, domain knowledge may contain information on a domain not present in the available domain dataset. CDKML has three steps. First, prior domain knowledge is enriched with relevant patterns obtained by machine learning to create an initial classifier. Second, genetic algorithms refine the classifier. Third, the classifier is adapted online on the basis of user feedback using the Markov decision process. CDKML was applied in fall detection. Tests showed that the classifiers developed by CDKML have better performance than machine‐learning classifiers generated on a training dataset that does not adequately represent all real‐life cases of the learned concept. The accuracy of the initial classifier was 10 percentage points higher than the best machine‐learning classifier and the refinement added 3 percentage points. The online adaptation improved the accuracy of the refined classifier by an additional 15 percentage points.","",""

This provides a far more efficient and robust transition state search. In contrast to a conventional NEB calculation, the algorithm presented here eliminates any need for manipulating the number of images to obtain a converged result. This is achieved by inventing a new convergence criteria that exploits the probabilistic nature of the GPR to use uncertainty estimates of all images in combination with the force in the saddle point in the target model potential. Our method is an order of magnitude faster in terms of function evaluations than the conventional NEB method with no accuracy loss for the converged energy barrier values.","",""

The real-time multiband infrared brightness temperature from Himawari-8, combined with the spatiotemporally matched numerical weather prediction (NWP) data from the global forecast system, have been used as predictor variables for QPE. Among the variables used in RF learning model, total precipitable water and $K$ -index from NWP data have the highest rankings, indicating the importance of atmospheric environment for QPE. To enhance the accuracy of RF models or to optimize model training, a sample-balance technique has been utilized to adjust the ratios of samples in nonprecipitation/precipitation classification and quantitative precipitation regression data sets. Further sensitivity and validation analyses help determine the optimal RF classification and regression models for predicting nonprecipitation/precipitation pixel and rain rate. The selected RF classification model is found to predict precipitation area with an accuracy of 0.87. For predicted QPE product, the mean-absolute-error and root-mean-square error of RF regression model are 0.51 and 2.0 mm/h, respectively. Overall, the RF ML algorithm has a higher detection rate over homogenous ocean surface as compared with over land.

Intuitively, constraining the dimensionality of inputs or parameters of a network reduces the “space” in which adversarial examples exist. Guided by this intuition, we demonstrate that discretization greatly improves the robustness of the DLNs against adversarial attacks. Specifically, discretizing the input space (or allowed pixel levels from 256 values or 8<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$bit$ </tex-math></inline-formula> to 4 values or 2<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$bit$ </tex-math></inline-formula>) extensively improves the adversarial robustness of the DLNs for a substantial range of perturbations for minimal loss in test accuracy. Furthermore, we find that binary neural networks (BNNs) and related variants are intrinsically more robust than their full precision counterparts in adversarial scenarios. Combining input discretization with the BNNs furthers the robustness, even waiving the need for adversarial training for the certain magnitude of perturbation values. We evaluate the effect of discretization on MNIST, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet datasets. Across all datasets, we observe maximal adversarial resistance with 2<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$bit$ </tex-math></inline-formula> input discretization that incurs an adversarial accuracy loss of just ~1% – 2% as compared to clean test accuracy against single-step attacks.

Faces contain information that can be used to interpret levels of drowsiness. There are many facial features that can be extracted from the face to infer the level of drowsiness. These include eye blinks, head movements and yawning. However, the development of a drowsiness detection system that yields reliable and accurate results is a challenging task as it requires accurate and robust algorithms. A wide range of techniques has been examined to detect driver drowsiness in the past. The recent rise of deep learning requires that these algorithms be revisited to evaluate their accuracy in detection of drowsiness. As a result, this paper reviews machine learning techniques which include support vector machines, convolutional neural networks and hidden Markov models in the context of drowsiness detection. Furthermore, a meta-analysis is conducted on 25 papers that use machine learning techniques for drowsiness detection. The analysis reveals that support vector machine technique is the most commonly used technique to detect drowsiness, but convolutional neural networks performed better than the other two techniques. Finally, this paper lists publicly available datasets that can be used as benchmarks for drowsiness detection.","",""

In this paper, we propose a general defense framework called PatchGuard that can achieve high provable robustness while maintaining high clean accuracy against localized adversarial patches. The cornerstone of PatchGuard involves the use of CNNs with small receptive fields to impose a bound on the number of features corrupted by an adversarial patch. Given a bounded number of corrupted features, the problem of designing an adversarial patch defense reduces to that of designing a secure feature aggregation mechanism. Towards this end, we present our robust masking defense that robustly detects and masks corrupted features to recover the correct prediction. Notably, we can prove the robustness of our defense against any adversary within our threat model. Our extensive evaluation on ImageNet, ImageNette (a 10-class subset of ImageNet), and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrates that our defense achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both provable robust accuracy and clean accuracy.","",""

In this paper, we develop a robust and efficient algorithm to enhance the accuracy for (ultrawide bandwidth) time-of-arrival localization through identifying and mitigating NLOS signals with relevance vector machine (RVM) techniques.

Recent advances in this field have been achieved by machine learning classifiers working in conjunction with time-frequency feature representations. This combination has achieved excellent accuracy for classification of discrete sounds. The ability to recognise sounds under real-world noisy conditions, called robust sound event classification, is an especially challenging task that has attracted recent research attention. Another aspect of real-word conditions is the classification of continuous, occluded or overlapping sounds, rather than classification of short isolated sound recordings. This paper addresses the classification of noise-corrupted, occluded, overlapped, continuous sound recordings. It first proposes a standard evaluation task for such sounds based upon a common existing method for evaluating isolated sound classification. It then benchmarks several high performing isolated sound classifiers to operate with continuous sound data by incorporating an energy-based event detection front end. Results are reported for each tested system using the new task, to provide the first analysis of their performance for continuous sound event detection. In addition it proposes and evaluates a novel Bayesian-inspired front end for the segmentation and detection of continuous sound recordings prior to classification.","",""

To address this problem, we propose FR-Train, which holistically performs fair and robust model training. We provide a mutual information-based interpretation of an existing adversarial training-based fairness-only method, and apply this idea to architect an additional discriminator that can identify poisoned data using a clean validation set and reduce its influence.

Since the attacker gets to design and train his attack classifier based on the defense, we first demonstrate that at a straightforward technique for generating adversarial-example based traces fails to protect against an attacker using adversarial training for robust classification. We then propose Mockingbird, a technique for generating traces that resists adversarial training by moving randomly in the space of viable traces and not following more predictable gradients. The technique drops the accuracy of the state-of-the-art attack hardened with adversarial training from 98% to 42–58% while incurring only 58% bandwidth overhead.

We show that a thicker boundary helps improve robustness against adversarial examples (e.g., improving the robust test accuracy of adversarial training) as well as so-called out-of-distribution (OOD) transforms, and we show that many commonly-used regularization and data augmentation procedures can increase boundary thickness. On the theoretical side, we establish that maximizing boundary thickness during training is akin to the so-called mixup training. Using these observations, we show that noise-augmentation on mixup training further increases boundary thickness, thereby combating vulnerability to various forms of adversarial attacks and OOD transforms. We can also show that the performance improvement in several lines of recent work happens in conjunction with a thicker boundary.","",""

In this paper, we propose BundleNet, a framework of sequential structure (named bundle-module, see Fig. 1) for deep neural networks to handle the label noise. The bundle module naturally takes into account sample correlations by constructing bundles of samples class-by-class, and treats them as independent inputs.

Robust and interpretable classifiers with high accuracy are usually favored for their clinical and translational potential. The top scoring pair (TSP) algorithm is an example that applies a simple rank-based algorithm to identify rank-altered gene pairs for classifier construction. Although many classification methods perform well in cross-validation of single expression profile, the performance usually greatly reduces in cross-study validation (i.e. the prediction model is established in the training study and applied to an independent test study) for all machine learning methods, including TSP. The failure of cross-study validation has largely diminished the potential translational and clinical values of the models. The purpose of this article is to develop a meta-analytic top scoring pair (MetaKTSP) framework that combines multiple transcriptomic studies and generates a robust prediction model applicable to independent test studies.   RESULTS We proposed two frameworks, by averaging TSP scores or by combining P-values from individual studies, to select the top gene pairs for model construction. We applied the proposed methods in simulated data sets and three large-scale real applications in breast cancer, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and pan-cancer methylation. The result showed superior performance of cross-study validation accuracy and biomarker selection for the new meta-analytic framework. In conclusion, combining multiple omics data sets in the public domain increases robustness and accuracy of the classification model that will ultimately improve disease understanding and clinical treatment decisions to benefit patients.

The belief was challenged by recent studies where we can maintain the robustness and improve the accuracy.

In this paper, we show this direction is also promising. Firstly, we find even over-parameterized deep networks may still have insufficient model capacity, because adversarial training has an overwhelming smoothing effect. Secondly, given limited model capacity, we argue adversarial data should have unequal importance: geometrically speaking, a natural data point closer to/farther from the class boundary is less/more robust, and the corresponding adversarial data point should be assigned with larger/smaller weight. Finally, to implement the idea, we propose geometry-aware instance-reweighted adversarial training, where the weights are based on how difficult it is to attack a natural data point. Experiments show that our proposal boosts the robustness of standard adversarial training; combining two directions, we improve both robustness and accuracy of standard adversarial training.","",""

We study the impact of model size in this setting, focusing on Transformer models for NLP tasks that are limited by compute: self-supervised pretraining and high-resource machine translation. We first show that even though smaller Transformer models execute faster per iteration, wider and deeper models converge in significantly fewer steps. Moreover, this acceleration in convergence typically outpaces the additional computational overhead of using larger models. Therefore, the most compute-efficient training strategy is to counterintuitively train extremely large models but stop after a small number of iterations.  This leads to an apparent trade-off between the training efficiency of large Transformer models and the inference efficiency of small Transformer models. However, we show that large models are more robust to compression techniques such as quantization and pruning than small models. Consequently, one can get the best of both worlds: heavily compressed, large models achieve higher accuracy than lightly compressed, small models.","",""

On the other hand, we find that standard English word-level methods (such as Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count 2015’s Positive emotion dictionary and Language Assessment by Mechanical Turk) can yield estimates of county well-being inversely correlated with survey estimates, due to regional cultural and socioeconomic differences in language use. Some of the most frequent misleading words can be removed to improve the accuracy of these word-level methods. Researchers and policy makers worldwide are interested in measuring the subjective well-being of populations. When users post on social media, they leave behind digital traces that reflect their thoughts and feelings. Aggregation of such digital traces may make it possible to monitor well-being at large scale. However, social media-based methods need to be robust to regional effects if they are to produce reliable estimates. Using a sample of 1.53 billion geotagged English tweets, we provide a systematic evaluation of word-level and data-driven methods for text analysis for generating well-being estimates for 1,208 US counties. We compared Twitter-based county-level estimates with well-being measurements provided by the Gallup-Sharecare Well-Being Index survey through 1.73 million phone surveys. We find that word-level methods (e.g., Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count [LIWC] 2015 and Language Assessment by Mechanical Turk [LabMT]) yielded inconsistent county-level well-being measurements due to regional, cultural, and socioeconomic differences in language use. However, removing as few as three of the most frequent words led to notable improvements in well-being prediction. Data-driven methods provided robust estimates, approximating the Gallup data at up to r = 0.64.

Theoretically, we show that in a simple statistical setting, the sample complexity for learning an adversarially robust model from unlabeled data matches the fully supervised case up to constant factors. On standard datasets like CIFAR-10, a simple Unsupervised Adversarial Training (UAT) approach using unlabeled data improves robust accuracy by 21.7% over using 4K supervised examples alone, and captures over 95% of the improvement from the same number of labeled examples. Finally, we report an improvement of 4% over the previous state-of-the-art on CIFAR-10 against the strongest known attack by using additional unlabeled data from the uncurated 80 Million Tiny Images dataset.

The existing state-of-the-art SER system has a quite low prediction performance, which needs improvement in order to make it feasible for the real-time commercial applications. The key reason for the low accuracy and the poor prediction rate is the scarceness of the data and a model configuration, which is the most challenging task to build a robust machine learning technique. In this paper, we addressed the limitations of the existing SER systems and proposed a unique artificial intelligence (AI) based system structure for the SER that utilizes the hierarchical blocks of the convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) with sequence learning. We designed four blocks of ConvLSTM, which is called the local features learning block (LFLB), in order to extract the local emotional features in a hierarchical correlation.

The overall goal of MDR is to change the representation space of the data to make interactions easier to detect. It is well known that machine learning methods may not provide robust models when the class variable (e.g. case‐control status) is imbalanced and accuracy is used as the fitness measure. This is because most methods learn patterns that are relevant for the larger of the two classes. The goal of this study was to evaluate three different strategies for improving the power of MDR to detect epistasis in imbalanced datasets. The methods evaluated were: (1) over‐sampling that resamples with replacement the smaller class until the data are balanced, (2) under‐sampling that randomly removes subjects from the larger class until the data are balanced, and (3) balanced accuracy [(sensitivity+specificity)/2] as the fitness function with and without an adjusted threshold. These three methods were compared using simulated data with two‐locus epistatic interactions of varying heritability (0.01, 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4) and minor allele frequency (0.2, 0.4) that were embedded in 100 replicate datasets of varying sample sizes (400, 800, 1600). Each dataset was generated with different ratios of cases to controls (1 : 1, 1 : 2, 1 : 4). We found that the balanced accuracy function with an adjusted threshold significantly outperformed both over‐sampling and under‐sampling and fully recovered the power. These results suggest that balanced accuracy should be used instead of accuracy for the MDR analysis of epistasis in imbalanced datasets. Genet. Epidemiol.. 2007. © 2007 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.","",""

However, the relationships between the engineering properties of UHPC and its mixture composition are highly nonlinear and difficult to delineate using traditional statistical methods. There is a need for robust and advanced methods that can streamline the diverse pertinent experimental data available to create predictive tools with superior accuracy and provide insight into its nonlinear materials science aspects. Machine learning is a powerful tool that can unravel underlying patterns in complex data. Accordingly, this study endeavors to employ state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to predict the compressive strength of UHPC using a comprehensive experimental database retrieved from the open literature consisting of 810 test observations and 15 input features. A novel approach based on tabular generative adversarial networks was used to generate 6513 plausible synthetic data for training robust machine learning models, including random forest, extra trees, and gradient boosting regression. While the models were trained using the synthetic data, their ability to generalize their predictions was tested on the 810 experimental data thus far unknown and never presented to the models. The results indicate that the developed models achieved outstanding predictive performance. Parametric studies using the models were able to provide insight into the strength development mechanisms of UHPC and the significance of the various influential parameters.","",""

A variety of recent adversarial training procedures have been proposed to remedy this issue. Despite the success of such procedures at increasing accuracy on adversarially perturbed inputs or robust accuracy, these techniques often reduce accuracy on natural unperturbed inputs or standard accuracy. Complicating matters further the effect and trend of adversarial training procedures on standard and robust accuracy is rather counter intuitive and radically dependent on a variety of factors including the perceived form of the perturbation during training, size/quality of data, model overparameterization, etc. In this paper we focus on binary classification problems where the data is generated according to the mixture of two Gaussians with general anisotropic covariance matrices and derive a precise characterization of the standard and robust accuracy for a class of minimax adversarially trained models. We consider a general norm-based adversarial model, where the adversary can add perturbations of bounded $\ell_p$ norm to each input data, for an arbitrary $p\ge 1$. Our comprehensive analysis allows us to theoretically explain several intriguing empirical phenomena and provide a precise understanding of the role of different problem parameters on standard and robust accuracies.","",""
