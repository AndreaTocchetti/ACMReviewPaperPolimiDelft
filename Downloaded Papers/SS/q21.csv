The robustness of AI algorithms is of great interest as inaccurate prediction could result in safety concerns and limit the adoption of AI systems. In this paper, we propose a framework based on design of experiments to systematically investigate the robustness of AI classification algorithms. A robust classification algorithm is expected to have high accuracy and low variability under different application scenarios. The robustness can be affected by a wide range of factors such as the imbalance of class labels in the training dataset, the chosen prediction algorithm, the chosen dataset of the application, and a change of distribution in the training and test datasets. To investigate the robustness of AI classification algorithms, we conduct a comprehensive set of mixture experiments to collect prediction performance results. Then statistical analyses are conducted to understand how various factors affect the robustness of AI classification algorithms. We summarize our findings and provide suggestions to practitioners in AI applications.","",""

Finally, the MS-CNN model is taken as the research object for improvement to explore the influence of label errors (p = 0.03, 0.05, 0.07, 0.09, 0.12) with different parameter settings and different probabilities (size of convolutional kernel, Dropout rate) on the recognition accuracy of MS-CNN model, at the same time, a CIR system platform based on MS-CNN model is built, and the recognition performance of salt and pepper noise images with different SNR (0, 0.03, 0.05, 0.07, 0.1) was compared, then the performance of the algorithm in the actual image recognition test was compared. The results show that the recognition accuracy is the highest (97.8%) when the convolution kernel size in the MS-CNN model is 2*2 and 3*3, and the average recognition accuracy is the highest (97.8%) when the dropout rate is 0.1; when the error probability of picture label is 12%, the recognition accuracy of the model constructed in this study is above 96%. Finally, the commodity image database constructed in this study is used to identify and verify the model. The recognition accuracy of the algorithm in this study is significantly higher than that of the Minitch stochastic gradient descent algorithm under different SNR conditions, and the recognition accuracy is the highest when SNR = 0 (99.3%).

System performance under the proposed FFORC scheme is compared with classical sliding mode control(SMC).The experimental results justifies the superiority of the proposed FFORC control scheme under all test conditions.Under ideal condition and with the proposed FFORC control scheme, the speed tracking error is approximately zero while with SMC method the peak tracking error is 0.4 radian/s. Similarly the active and reactive powers tracking is smooth with the proposed control system, while with SMC method the reactive power oscillates on both sides of the reference and it reaches 0.01 kVAR on positive side and −0.01kVAR on the negative side of the plot.Under parameters variation, system with FFORC control scheme offers minimum steady state error which is about 0.01 radian/s, while in case of SMC with saturation function a peak value of 0.6 radian/s is recorded.

In this article, we review the most recent efforts to improve confidence in the robustness of toxicological data and investigate the impact that data curation has on the confidence in model predictions. We also present two case studies demonstrating the effect of data curation on the performance of AI models for predicting skin sensitisation and skin irritation.

However, health care has been relatively late to adopt them. This article provides clinical examples in which machine learning and artificial intelligence are already in use in health care and appear to deliver benefit. Three key bottlenecks toward increasing the pace of diffusion and adoption are methodological issues in evaluation of artificial intelligence-based interventions, reporting standards to enable assessment of model performance, and issues that need to be addressed for an institution to adopt these interventions. Methodological best practices will include external validation, ideally at a different site; use of proactive learning algorithms to correct for site-specific biases and increase robustness as algorithms are deployed across multiple sites; addressing subgroup performance; and communicating to providers the uncertainty of predictions. Regarding reporting, especially important issues are the extent to which implementing standardized approaches for introducing clinical decision support has been followed, describing the data sources, reporting on data assumptions, and addressing biases. Although most health care organizations in the United States have adopted electronic health records, they may be ill prepared to adopt machine learning and artificial intelligence. Several steps can enable this: preparing data, developing tools to get suggestions to clinicians in useful ways, and getting clinicians engaged in the process. Open challenges and the role of regulation in this area are briefly discussed. Although these techniques have enormous potential to improve care and personalize recommendations for individuals, the hype regarding them is tremendous.

We optimized five deep learning architectures, implemented development strategies by manipulating data distribution to quantitatively compare study designs, and introduced several detection scenarios to evaluate the robustness and diagnostic performance of the models.

To develop and validate a robust CMR analysis tool for automatic segmentation and cardiac function analysis which achieves state-of-the-art performance for multi-vendor short-axis cine CMR images.         The current work is an extension of our previously published quality-controlled AI-based tool for cine CMR analysis [1]. We deployed an AI algorithm that is equipped to handle different image sizes and domains automatically - the ‘nnU-Net’ framework [2] - and retrained our tool using the UK Biobank (UKBB) cohort population (n = 4,872) and a large database of clinical CMR studies obtained from two NHS hospitals (n = 3,406). The NHS hospital data came from three different scanner types: Siemens Aera 1.5T (n = 1,419), Philips Achieva 1.5T and 3T (n = 1,160), and Philips Ingenia 1.5T (n = 827). The ‘nnU-net’ was used to segment both ventricles and the myocardium. The proposed method was evaluated on randomly selected test sets from UKBB (n = 488) and NHS (n = 331) and on two external publicly available databases of clinical CMRs acquired on Philips, Siemens, General Electric (GE), and Canon CMR scanners – ACDC (n = 100) [3] and M&Ms (n = 321) [4]. We calculated the Dice scores - which measure the overlap between manual and automatic segmentations - and compared manual vs AI-based measures of biventricular volumes and function.          Table 1 shows that the Dice scores for the NHS, ACDC, and M&Ms scans are similar to those obtained in the highly controlled, single vendor and single field strength UKBB scans. Although our AI-based tool was only trained on CMR scans from two vendors (Philips and Siemens), it performs similarly in unseen vendors (GE and Canon). Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art performance in online segmentation challenges, without being specifically trained on these databases. Table 1 also shows good agreement between manual and automated clinical measures of ejection fraction and ventricular volume and mass.        We show that our proposed AI-based tool, which combines training on a large-scale multi-domain CMR database with a state-of-the-art AI algorithm, allows us to robustly deal with routine clinical data from multiple centres, vendors, and field strengths. This is a fundamental step for the clinical translation of AI algorithms. Moreover, our method yields a range of additional metrics of cardiac function (filling and ejection rates, regional wall motion, and strain) at no extra computational cost. ","",""

The AIBC consists of four layers: a fundamental layer, a resource layer, an application layer, and an ecosystem layer (the latter three are the collective “upper-layers”). The AIBC layers have distinguished responsibilities and thus performance and robustness requirements. The upper layers need to follow a set of economic policies strictly and run on a deterministic and robust protocol. While the fundamental layer needs to follow a protocol with high throughput without sacrificing robustness. As such, the AIBC implements a two-consensus scheme to enforce economic policies and achieve performance and robustness: Delegated Proof of Economic Value (DPoEV) incentive consensus on the upper layers, and Delegated Adaptive Byzantine Fault Tolerance (DABFT) distributed consensus on the fundamental layer. The DPoEV uses the knowledge map algorithm to accurately assess the economic value of digital assets. The DABFT uses deep learning techniques to predict and select the most suitable BFT algorithm in order to enforce the DPoEV, as well as to achieve the best balance of performance, robustness, and security. The DPoEV-DABFT dual-consensus architecture, by design, makes the AIBC attack-proof against risks such as double-spending, short-range and 51% attacks; it has a built-in dynamic sharding feature that allows scalability and eliminates the single-shard takeover. Our contribution is four-fold: that we develop a set of innovative economic models governing the monetary, trading and supply-demand policies in the AIBC; that we establish an upper-layer DPoEV incentive consensus algorithm that implements the economic policies; that we provide a fundamental layer DABFT distributed consensus algorithm that executes the DPoEV with adaptability; and that we prove the economic models can be effectively enforced by AIBC’s DPoEV-DABFT dual-consensus architecture.","",""

However, as these neural networks become bigger, more complex, and more widely used, fundamental problems with current deep learning models become more apparent. State-of-the-art deep learning models are known to suffer from issues that range from poor robustness, inability to adapt to novel task settings, to requiring rigid and inflexible configuration assumptions.

This complex property makes the prediction, analysis, or fault detection/diagnosis of building energy consumption very difficult to accurately and quickly perform. This thesis mainly focuses on up-to-date artificial intelligence models with the applications to solve these problems. First, we review recently developed models for solving these problems, including detailed and simplified engineering methods, statistical methods and artificial intelligence methods. Then we simulate energy consumption profiles for single and multiple buildings, and based on these datasets, support vector machine models are trained and tested to do the prediction. The results from extensive experiments demonstrate high prediction accuracy and robustness of these models. Second, Recursive Deterministic Perceptron (RDP) neural network model is used to detect and diagnose faulty building energy consumption. The abnormal consumption is simulated by manually introducing performance degradation to electric devices. In the experiment, RDP model shows very high detection ability. A new approach is proposed to diagnose faults. It is based on the evaluation of RDP models, each of which is able to detect an equipment fault.Third, we investigate how the selection of subsets of features influences the model performance. The optimal features are selected based on the feasibility of obtaining them and on the scores they provide under the evaluation of two filter methods. Experimental results confirm the validity of the selected subset and show that the proposed feature selection method can guarantee the model accuracy and reduces the computational time.One challenge of predicting building energy consumption is to accelerate model training when the dataset is very large. This thesis proposes an efficient parallel implementation of support vector machines based on decomposition method for solving such problems. The parallelization is performed on the most time-consuming work of training, i.e., to update the gradient vector f. The inner problems are dealt by sequential minimal optimization solver. The underlying parallelism is conducted by the shared memory version of Map-Reduce paradigm, making the system particularly suitable to be applied to multi-core and multiprocessor systems.

Common practices like statistical type curves, analytical methods, and numerical simulation are not well suited to incorporate all the complexities involving rock/fluid properties, geological parameters, artificial lift systems, well and completion designs, etc. In this work, we introduce a novel ""Augmented AI"" (Artificial Intelligence) workflow for reliable forecasting of unconventional well performance and show its impact on decision making. Augmented AI represents smart integration of artificial intelligence and domain knowledge. In the application of well performance forecast, a smart DCA algorithm automatically estimates the short- and long-term performance of the historical wells; a spectrum of well attributes are aggregated/transformed with the consideration of uncertainty and robustness for training and prediction. Boosting and bootstrap tree-based models are ensembled to maximize the model generalization capability. In contrast to the commonly seen black-box modeling practices, the factor-specific impacts are deconvoluted, allowing for validation of the underlying physics. Furthermore, this gives guidelines for future well planning and completion designs. A case study is presented, where the workflow is implemented. Multi-disciplinary data (logs, completions, maps, fluid properties, etc.) from thousands of wells were integrated. During the feature engineering step, raw data was converted to a set of meaningful parameters leveraging the domain knowledge. As an example, some of the features were combined, some were transformed, and others were normalized. Then a machine learning model was created using an ensemble approach. The models showed a good model accuracy on the training, testing, and validation dataset. Leveraging the predictive model, thousands of field development opportunities including new vertical wells, new horizontal wells, recompletions, and completion optimization were identified that resulted in increased production, increased reserves, and improved capital efficiency. Using the model explanation techniques, the impact of various parameters on the well performance was quantified that resulted in best practices for future drilling and completion design.","",""

The multi-layer feed-forward ANN tool with the error back-propagation training method is employed. Loads have been taken as the function of voltage. Analytical techniques have mostly been based on impedance load reduced network models, which suffer from several disadvantages, including inadequate load representation and lack of structural integrity. The ability of ANNs to spontaneously learn from examples, reason over inexact and fuzzy data and provide adequate and quick responses to new information not previously stored in memory has generated high performance dynamical system with unprecedented robustness. ANNs models have been developed for different hybrid power system configurations for tuning the proportional-integral controller for SVC.

We present some analytical formulas to estimate the ratio/relationship between these parameters. It can be observed that there exists a clear relationship between robustness and energy efficiency and a clear trade-off between robustness/energy efficiency and makespan.

Precise classification of brain tumor grade (low-grade and high-grade glioma) at an early stage plays a key role in successful prognosis and treatment planning. With recent advances in deep learning, artificial intelligence–enabled brain tumor grading systems can assist radiologists in the interpretation of medical images within seconds. The performance of deep learning techniques is, however, highly depended on the size of the annotated dataset. It is extremely challenging to label a large quantity of medical images, given the complexity and volume of medical data. In this work, we propose a novel transfer learning–based active learning framework to reduce the annotation cost while maintaining stability and robustness of the model performance for brain tumor classification. In this retrospective research, we employed a 2D slice–based approach to train and fine-tune our model on the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) training dataset of 203 patients and a validation dataset of 66 patients which was used as the baseline. With our proposed method, the model achieved area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 82.89% on a separate test dataset of 66 patients, which was 2.92% higher than the baseline AUC while saving at least 40% of labeling cost. In order to further examine the robustness of our method, we created a balanced dataset, which underwent the same procedure. The model achieved AUC of 82% compared with AUC of 78.48% for the baseline, which reassures the robustness and stability of our proposed transfer learning augmented with active learning framework while significantly reducing the size of training data.","",""

In the context of a self-driving car, AI system accountability could be a question of safety; in the context of credit scoring, AI system accountability could be a question of fairness. In an algorithmic trading system, the AI system accountability could be a question of performance and robustness to certain shocks. In this overview, we will not focus on any particular objective (such as safety, fairness, or robustness); we believe that defining and refining these objectives for each context is a moral decision that must be made by the public and their representatives, not technologists.

Rather than purely fitting the observed training data, stable learning tries to learn a model with uniformly good performance under non-stationary and agnostic testing data. The key challenge of stable learning in practice is that we do not have any knowledge about the true model and test data distribution as a priori. Under such condition, we cannot expect a faithful estimation of model parameters and its stability over wild changing environments. Previous methods resort to a reweighting scheme to remove the correlations between all the variables through a set of new sample weights. However, we argue that such aggressive decorrelation between all the variables may cause the over-reduced sample size, which leads to the variance inflation and possible underperformance. In this paper, we incorporate the unlabled data from multiple environments into the variable decorrelation framework and propose a Differentiated Variable Decorrelation (DVD) algorithm based on the clustering of variables. Specifically, the variables are clustered according to the stability of their correlations and the variable decorrelation module learns a set of sample weights to remove the correlations merely between the variables of different clusters. Empirical studies on both synthetic and real world datasets clearly demonstrate the efficacy of our DVD algorithm on improving the model parameter estimation and the prediction stability over changing distributions.","",""

At present, robot manipulators are used in unknown and unstructured situation and caused to provide complicated systems, consequently strong mathematical tools are used in new control methodologies to design nonlinear robust controller with satisfactory performance (e.g., minimum error, good trajectory, disturbance rejection). Robotic systems controlling is vital due to the wide range of application. Obviously stability and robustness are the most minimum requirements in control systems; even though the proof of stability and robustness is more important especially in the case of nonlinear systems. The strategies of robotic manipulators control are classified into two main groups: classical and non-classical methods, where the conventional control theory uses the classical method and the artificial intelligence theory (e.g., fuzzy logic, neural network, and neuro fuzzy) uses the non-classical methods. However both of classical and non-classical theories have applied successfully in many applications, but they also have some limitations. One of the best nonlinear robust controllers which can be used in uncertainty nonlinear systems is sliding mode controller (SMC). Sliding mode controller has two most important challenges: chattering phenomenon and nonlinear dynamic equivalent part.

Therefore, an accurate estimate of bus headway can benefit both transit riders and transit operators. This paper proposed a relevance vector machine (RVM) algorithm to predict bus headway by incorporating the time series of bus headways, travel time, and passenger demand at previous stops. Different from traditional computational intelligence approaches, RVM can output the probabilistic prediction result, in which the upper and lower bounds of a predicted headway within a certain probability are yielded. An empirical experiment with two bus routes in Beijing, China, is utilized to confirm the high precision and strong robustness of the proposed model. Five algorithms [support vector machine (SVM), genetic algorithm SVM, Kalman filter, k-nearest neighbor, and artificial neural network] are used for comparison with the RVM model and the result indicates that RVM outperforms these algorithms in terms of accuracy and confidence intervals. When the confidence level is set to 95%, more than 95% of actual bus headways fall within the prediction bands. With the probabilistic bus headway prediction information, transit riders can better schedule their trips to avoid late and early arrivals at bus stops, while transit operators can adopt the targeted correction actions to maintain regular headway for bus bunching prevention.","",""

This work aims to study the ability of intelligent models to detect small leaks in a natural gas pipeline using operational parameters such as pressure, temperature and flowrate through existing industry performance metrics (sensitivity, reliability, robustness and accuracy). Observer design technique was applied to detect leaks in a gas pipeline using a regresso-classification hierarchical model where an intelligent model acts as a regressor and a leak detection algorithm acts as a classifier. Five intelligent models (Gradient Boosting, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and Artificial Neural Network) were used in this present work.  Results showed that the Random Forest and Decision Tree models are the most sensitive as they can detect a leak of 0.1% of nominal flow in about 2 hours. All the intelligent models had high reliability with zero false alarm rate in testing phase. However, due to this level of reliability, the models had low accuracy with the Artificial Neural Network and Support Vector Machine performing best and better regressors than the others. All the intelligent models are robust. The average time to leak detection for different leak sizes for all the intelligent models were compared to a real time transient model in literature. The intelligent models had a time savings of 25% to 48%.

The goodness-of-fit of models is among other factors dependent from the completeness of the time series data. Particular in developing countries gaps in time series data are very common. Since gaps can severely compromise data utility this research with application to the Andean Paute river basin examines the performance of 17 deterministic infill methods for completing time series of daily precipitation and mean temperature. Although sophisticated approaches for infilling gaps, such as stochastic or artificial intelligence methods exist, preference in this study was given to deterministic approaches for their robustness, easiness of implementation and computational efficiency. Results reveal that for the infilling of daily precipitation time series the weighted multiple linear regression method outperforms due to considering the ratio of the Pearson correlation coefficient to the distance, giving more weight to both, highly correlated and nearby stations. For mean temperature, the climatological mean of the day was clearly the best method, most likely due to the scarcity of weather stations measuring temperature, and because the few available stations are located at different elevations in the landscape, suggesting the need to address in future studies the impact of elevation on the interpolation.

To overcome the drawbacks of PI controller the Fuzzy Logic Controllers (FLCs) are modelled. This paper presents the fuzzy logic based control strategy for the variable speed wind turbine generator by using Doubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG). The mathematical model for DFIG is developed in synchronous reference frame by using SFOCS for current and voltage control and is discretized in time domain. Based on this model the artificial intelligence based FLCs are designed and implemented so as to improve the performance and efficiency of the system. This control scheme not only enhances the dynamic performance but also maintains almost unity power factor to the grid. In order to explore the robustness of the FLC and conventional PI controller, simulations are carried out for rapid variation of wind speed, and different disturbances generated in the system. The simulation results show that the proposed fuzzy logic based control strategies have better power control, faster oscillation damping, more accurate regulation, considerably reduced settling time and has fewer ripples in comparison with conventional PI controller. In the proposed SFOCS, the PI controllers are replaced with FLCs, to improve the performance and efficiency of the system. The system performance is analyzed for real and reactive power control in SFOCS for the effectiveness of synchronization with the grid.","",""

The motivation of this work is to use sociological notions and theories of ’organisation’ to blueprint more robust multiagent systems. Based on an analysis of the DAI literature, we give a precise and empirically verifiable definition of robustness, which we call τ-robustness. This notion consists of (i) the definition of a performance measure, (ii) the definition of a perturbation against which the performance measure is evaluated, and (iii) a threshold τ , which marks the maximally allowed deviation of the performance measure to call the tested system τ-robust. The main theoretic contribution of this thesis is a framework of design parameters for robust multiagent organisation based on a sociological notion of organisation. This framework, called the Framework for selfOrganisation and Robustness in Multiagent systems (FORM), can be applied to multiagent organisation using the concept of holonic multiagent systems, for which a new, extended definition is presented. By freely combining all possible values of the parameters in the framework, it allows to model more than 90 000 different forms of multiagent organisation. Furthermore, we discuss how the holonic design parameters relate to different dimensions of the autonomy of the participating agents. This discussion shows that, and how, the notion of self-organisation is connected to the notion of adjustable autonomy. As the notion of autonomy is central to the definition of an agent, this constitutes an important contribution to the general theory of multiagent systems. In order to make the large design space spanned by FORM concrete, we chose to model a subset of the possible organisational forms. This choice is based on a sociological analysis of organisations in today’s economy and makes a diverse use of the available values for the design parameters. The modelled forms of organisation are arranged on a spectrum of autonomy ranging from fully autonomous agents to more and more coupled agents, until we reach an organisational form where the boundaries between individual agents dissolve and only one single agent remains. This spectrum can be used to devise a mechanism for self-organisation in the sense that agents start to organise in a loosely coupled holon and increase the 1 Collaborative research group in Socionics.","",""

However, a typically-sized CNN is well known to be computationally intensive. This work presents a novel stochastic-based and scalable hardware architecture and circuit design that computes a large-scale CNN with FPGA. The key idea is to implement all key components of a deep learning CNN, including multi-dimensional convolution, activation, and pooling layers, completely in the probabilistic computing domain in order to achieve high computing robustness, high performance, and low hardware usage. Our approach has three advantages. First, it can achieve significantly lower algorithmic complexity for any given accuracy requirement.

Second, this proposed stochastic-based architecture is highly fault-tolerant because the information to be processed is encoded with a large ensemble of random samples. As such, the local perturbations of its computing accuracy will be dissipated globally, thus becoming inconsequential to the final overall results. More interestingly, our measured results have shown that 0.1 percent degradation in computing accuracy of CNN can actually mitigate the well-known overfitting problem. Overall, being highly scalable and energy efficient, our stochastic-based convolutional neural network architecture is well-suited for a modular vision engine with the goal of performing real-time detection, recognition, and segmentation of mega-pixel images, especially those perception-based computing tasks that are inherently fault-tolerant, while still requiring high energy efficiency.","",""

Most of the novel approaches in this field have adopted Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to improve performance as well as robustness of IDS. The true power and advantages of ANN lie in its ability to represent both linear and non-linear relationships and learn these relationships directly from the data being modeled.

We focus on the model-based, also called model-building, algorithms that attempt to build the model along with optimization of the decision-making process. Model-based algorithms have certain advantages over model-free algorithms in that their behavior is more stable and robust. Another aspect of robustness and stability of the algorithm has to do with the variability in the value of the performance measure returned by the algorithm. We will present a new model-building algorithm that builds the transition probability model simultaneously with the value function and a new variance-penalizing algorithm that exhibits robustness with respect to the performance measure. Keyword 1: Optimization Keyword 2: Algorithm, Artificial Intelligence, operations research. INTRODUCTION Reinforcement learning (Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis, 1996; Sutton and Barto, 1998; Gosavi, 2003) seeks to solve Markov decision processes or problems (MDPs) via simulation-based optimization. Much of the literature in reinforcement learning (RL) focusses on bypassing the construction of the transition probability matrices (TPMs) needed in dynamic programming (DP). Indeed, the ability to solve the MDP without generating the TPM is one of the reasons why RL can break the curses of modeling and dimensionality that plague DP. However, bypassing the TPM model does come with a cost. It makes the RL algorithm’s convergence dependent on selecting an appropriate step-size (learning rate). This results in the performance becoming highly susceptible to optimal tuning of parameters that define the step size. In this paper, we seek to develop a model-building algorithm that generates the TPM simultaneously with the value function. The other algorithm we develop is one that studies robustness with respect to the variability in the performance metric.","",""

In this report, we present the process pattern as a vehicle for knowledge representation to capture process expertise at the business level. A pattern-based planning approach is proposed for automated workflow generation. Our pattern-oriented approach decreases user-visible complexity and makes systems more scalable and flexible by utilizing explicit knowledge support. Then we propose a hybrid method of pattern knowledge optimization for pattern-based workflow generation planning; experts define the primary model, and subsequent classifier training adjusts and improves the pattern knowledge settings. Experiments with a prototype application demonstrated that this approach can substantially reduce modelling difficulties and effectively improve pattern knowledge quality.","",""

A perceptron learning rule, originally developed for Artificial Intelligence applications, is used as the capacitor calibration algorithm. The system architecture and the circuit design for the capacitor array, the sampling network and the high performance comparator are discussed. The capacitor weights are adaptively calibrated to match the physical capacitors with better than 22-bit accuracy. Capacitor matching is not a limiting factor to the accuracy. Various sources of noise, interference and distortion are modeled to evaluate their effects and to ensure the robustness of the calibration algorithm. This architecture is especially suitable for mixed-signal VLSI in the Nanometer Era because it relaxes the matching requirement on analog circuitry.","",""

Thus we are able to improve ANN performance in the flood forecasting context by detailed process modelling. Low computation times and robustness are the key features of ANN models and also form the basic requirements for flash flood forecasting. After presenting the theory of the new methodology, the results of a catchment related meteorological analysis for generating storm scenarios serve as the input to a coupled hydrological/hydraulic model, which is set up for a mountainous catchment in east Germany. Along these lines we operate the catchment model for all realistically possible constellations of flood formation. This results in a database consisting of corresponding input/output vectors. We complete the database for training the ANN by adding yet more flood relevant data for characterizing the hydrological and meteorological catchment situation prior to a storm event. After this preparatory step, the ANN is applied for online flash flood forecasting in the considered catchment using an unseen storm event, i.e. one which did not feature in the training process. The convincing agreement between the predicted and observed flood hydrograph underlines the application potential of the new PAI-OFF methodology for online flood forecasting even in smaller catchments.","",""

That is, the AI system provides information to a human decision-maker, who has the final say.  However, for applications ranging from space exploration, to e-commerce, to search and rescue missions, there is an increasing need and desire for AI systems that display a much greater degree of autonomy. In designing autonomous AI systems, or agents, issues concerning safety, reliability, and robustness become critical. Does the agent observe appropriate safety constraints? Can we provide performance or goal-achievement guarantees? Does the agent deliberate and/or learn efficiently and in real time?  In this dissertation, we address some of these issues by developing an approach to agent design that integrates control-theoretic techniques, primarily methods based on Lyapunov functions, with planning and learning techniques from AI. Our main approach is to use control-theoretic domain knowledge to formulate, or restrict, the ways in which the agent can interact with its environment. This approach allows one to construct agents that enjoy provable safety and performance guarantees, and that reason and act in real-time or anytime fashion. Because the guarantees are established based on restrictions on the agent's behavior, specialized “safety-oriented” decision-making algorithms are not necessary. Agents can reason using standard AI algorithms; we discuss state-space search and reinforcement learning agents in detail. To a limited degree, we also show that the control-theoretic domain knowledge needed to ensure safe agent behavior can itself be learned by the agent, and need not be known a priori. We demonstrate our theory with simulation experiments on standard problems from robotics and control.","",""

Experimentation has shown that it is impossible for a human to control even a simple physical apparatus. Both on the simulator and on the physical system the efficiency and robustness of our controller has been compared with the performance obtained from another rule-based controller, one where the rule was derived from considering the systems' dynamic equations only. Trials conducted on the simulator indicated whose rule was based on theory alone. Our controller coped with changing system parameters, the other could not. However, trials conducted on the physical system showed that the two rule-based automatic controllers could control the physical system equally effectively. The results obtained from the automatically controlled physical system were used for trial-and-error learning, passive-learning. Here, sensor data was post-processed off-line, using a version of the ID3 rule-induction algorithm called c4.5. Feedback from these passively learned rules allowed a direct comparison to be made with the human generated rules.","",""
