This state-of-the-art performance offered by DNNs in many Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications has paved their way to being used in several safety-critical applications where even a single failure can lead to catastrophic results. Therefore, improving the robustness of these models to hardware-induced faults (such as soft errors, aging, and manufacturing defects) is of significant importance to avoid any disastrous event. Traditional redundancy-based fault mitigation techniques cannot be employed in a wide of applications due to their high overheads, which, when coupled with the compute-intensive nature of DNNs, lead to undesirable resource consumption. In this article, we present an overview of different low-cost fault-mitigation techniques that exploit the intrinsic characteristics of DNNs to limit their overheads. We discuss how each technique can contribute to the overall resilience of a DNN-based system, and how they can be integrated together to offer resilience against multiple diverse hardware-induced reliability threats. Towards the end, we highlight several key future directions that are envisioned to help in achieving highly dependable DL-based systems.","",""

Neural coding plays an essential role in enabling the brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) to perform different tasks. To search for the best coding scheme, we performed an extensive comparative study on the impact and performance of four important neural coding schemes, namely, rate coding, time-to-first spike (TTFS) coding, phase coding, and burst coding. The comparative study was carried out using a biological 2-layer SNN trained with an unsupervised spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) algorithm. Various aspects of network performance were considered, including classification accuracy, processing latency, synaptic operations (SOPs), hardware implementation, network compression efficacy, input and synaptic noise resilience, and synaptic fault tolerance. The classification tasks on Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) and Fashion-MNIST datasets were applied in our study. For hardware implementation, area and power consumption were estimated for these coding schemes, and the network compression efficacy was analyzed using pruning and quantization techniques. Different types of input noise and noise variations in the datasets were considered and applied. Furthermore, the robustness of each coding scheme to the non-ideality-induced synaptic noise and fault in analog neuromorphic systems was studied and compared. Our results show that TTFS coding is the best choice in achieving the highest computational performance with very low hardware implementation overhead. TTFS coding requires 4x/7.5x lower processing latency and 3.5x/6.5x fewer SOPs than rate coding during the training/inference process. Phase coding is the most resilient scheme to input noise. Burst coding offers the highest network compression efficacy and the best overall robustness to hardware non-idealities for both training and inference processes. The study presented in this paper reveals the design space created by the choice of each coding scheme, allowing designers to frame each scheme in terms of its strength and weakness given a designs’ constraints and considerations in neuromorphic systems.","",""

The mechanism of seizure emergence and the role of brief interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) in seizure generation are 2 of the most important unresolved issues in modern epilepsy research. We found that the transition to seizure is not a sudden phenomenon, but is instead a slow process that is characterized by the progressive loss of neuronal network resilience. From a dynamical perspective, the slow transition is governed by the principles of critical slowing, a robust natural phenomenon that is observable in systems characterized by transitions between dynamical regimes. In epilepsy, this process is modulated by synchronous synaptic input from IEDs. The IEDs are external perturbations that produce phasic changes in the slow transition process and exert opposing effects on the dynamics of a seizure-generating network, causing either antiseizure or proseizure effects. We found that the multifaceted nature of IEDs is defined by the dynamical state of the network at the moment of the discharge occurrence.","",""

In these domains, reliability and safety are important considerations, and hence it is critical to ensure the resilience of ML systems to faults and errors. On the other hand, soft errors are becoming more frequent in commodity computer systems due to the effects of technology scaling and reduced supply voltages. Further, traditional solutions for masking hardware faults such as Triple-Modular Redundancy (TMR) are prohibitively expensive in terms of their energy and performance overheads. Therefore, there is a compelling need to ensure the resilience of ML applications to soft errors on commodity hardware platforms.We first experimentally assess the resilience of safety-critical ML applications to soft errors. We demonstrate through fault injection experiments that even a single bit flip due to a soft error can lead to misclassification in Deep Neural Network (DNN) applications deployed in AVs, leading to safety violations. However, not all the errors in an DNN will result in serve consequences such as safety violations, and hence it is sufficient to protect the DNN from the ones that do. Unfortunately, finding all possible errors that result in safety violations is a very compute intensive task. We propose BinFI, a fault injection approach that efficiently injects critical faults that are highly likely to result in safety violations, based on the unique properties of DNNs. Finally, we propose Ranger, an approach to protect DNNs from critical faults with minimal performance overheads and no accuracy loss.

Previous studies have shown production of circular and figure-eight trajectories to be robust after training. This report shows the effects of different sampling rates on the production of trajectories by the ATNN neural network, including the influence of sampling rate on the robustness and noise-resilience of the resulting system. Although fast training occurred with few samples per trajectory, and the trajectory was learned successfully, more resilience to noise was observed when there were higher numbers of samples per trajectory. The effects of changing the initial segments that begin the trajectory generation were evaluated. This evaluation showed that a minimum length of initial segment is required, but that the location of that segment does not influence the trajectory generation, even when different initial segments are used during training and recall. A major conclusion from these results is that the network learns the inherent features of the trajectory rather than memorizing each point. When a recurrent loop was added from the output to the input of the ATNN, the training was shown to result in an attractor of the network for a figure-eight trajectory, which involves more complexity due to crossover compared with previous attractor training of a circular trajectory. Furthermore, when the trajectory length was not a multiple of the sampling interval, the trained network generated intervening points on subsequent repetitions of the trajectory, a feature of limit cycle attractors observed in dynamic networks. Thus, an effective method of training an individual dynamic attractor into a neural network is extended to more complex trajectories and to show the properties of a limit cycle attractor.","",""

The proposed CNN model, namely EEG-inception, is built on the backbone of the inception-time network, which has showed to be highly efficient and accurate for time-series classification.

Clinical exams are typically poorly temporally characterized, as seen in a low temporal resolution (LTR) compared to high temporal resolution (HTR) experimental acquisitions. Meanwhile, clinical demands incentivize shortening these exams. This study develops a neural network based approach to quantification of k1 , for increased robustness over current models such as the linearized single-input, two-compartment (LSITC) model.   METHODS 30 Liver HTR DCE MRI exams were acquired in 22 patients with at least 16 minutes of post-contrast data sampled at least every 13 seconds. A simple neural network (NN) with 4 hidden layers was trained on voxel-wise LTR data to predict k1 . LTR data was created by subsampling HTR data to contain 6 time points, replicating the characteristics of clinical LTR data. Both the total length and the placement of points in the training data was varied considerably to encourage robustness to variation. A GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) was used to generate arterial and portal venous inputs for use in data augmentation based on the dual-input, two-compartment, pharmacokinetic model of gadoxetic acid in the liver. The performance of the NN was compared to direct application of LSITC on both LTR and HTR data. The error was assessed when subsampling lengths from 16 to 4 minutes, enabling assessment of robustness to acquisition length.   RESULTS For acquisition lengths of 16 min NRMSE (Normalized Root-Mean-Squared Error) in k1 was 0.60, 1.77, and 1.21, for LSITC applied to HTR data, LSITC applied to LTR data, and GAN augmented NN applied to LTR data, respectively. As the acquisition length was shortened, errors greatly increased for LSITC approaches by several folds. For acquisitions shorter than 12 minutes the GAN augmented NN approach outperformed the LSITC approach to a statistically significant extent, even with HTR data.   CONCLUSIONS The study indicates that data length is significant for LSITC analysis as applied to DCE data for standard temporal sampling, and that machine learning methods, such as the implemented NN, have potential for much greater resilience to shortened acquisition time than directly fitting to the LSITC model.","",""

For this, we propose a low-complexity recurrent neural network (RNN)-based estimator that allows channel equalization of a sequence of channel observations based on independent time- and frequency-domain long short-term memory (LSTM) cells. Motivated by Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) applications, we simulate time- and frequency-selective channels with orthogonal frequency division multiplex (OFDM) and extend our channel models in such a way that a continuous degradation from line-of-sight (LoS) to non-line-of-sight (NLoS) conditions can be emulated. It turns out that the NN-based system cannot just compete with the LMMSE equalizer, but it also can be trained w.r.t. resilience against system parameter mismatch. We thereby showcase the conceptual simplicity of such a data-driven system design, as this not only enables more robustness against, e.g., signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) or Doppler spread estimation mismatches, but also allows to use the same equalizer over a wider range of input parameters without the need of re-building (or re-estimating) the filter coefficients. Particular attention has been paid to ensure compatibility with the existing IEEE 802.11p piloting scheme for V2X communications. Finally, feeding the payload data symbols as additional equalizer input unleashes further performance gains. We show significant gains over the conventional LMMSE equalization for highly dynamic channel conditions if such a data-augmented equalization scheme is used.","",""

The NN in the control law learns the system dynamics in an online manner, while the NN residual reconstruction errors and the bounded disturbances are overcome by the error sign signal. Since both of the NN output and the error sign signal are included in the integral, the continuity of the control input is ensured.

A promising category of accelerators utilizes nonvolatile memory arrays to both store weights and perform in situ analog computation inside the array. While prior work has explored the design space of analog accelerators to optimize performance and energy efficiency, there is seldom a rigorous evaluation of the accuracy of these accelerators. This work shows how architectural design decisions, particularly in mapping neural network parameters to analog memory cells, influence inference accuracy. When evaluated using ResNet50 on ImageNet, the resilience of the system to analog non-idealities—cell programming errors, analog-to-digital converter resolution, and array parasitic resistances—all improve when analog quantities in the hardware are made proportional to the weights in the network. Moreover, contrary to the assumptions of prior work, nearly equivalent resilience to cell imprecision can be achieved by fully storing weights as analog quantities, rather than spreading weight bits across multiple devices, often referred to as bit slicing. By exploiting proportionality, analog system designers have the freedom to match the precision of the hardware to the needs of the algorithm, rather than attempting to guarantee the same level of precision in the intermediate results as an equivalent digital accelerator. This ultimately results in an analog accelerator that is more accurate, more robust to analog errors, and more energy-efficient.","",""

Methods Self-consistent robust artificial-neural-networks for k-space interpolation (sRAKI) performs iterative parallel imaging reconstruction by enforcing self-consistency among coils. The approach bears similarity to SPIRiT, but extends the linear convolutions in SPIRiT to nonlinear interpolation using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). These CNNs are trained individually for each scan using the scan-specific autocalibrating signal (ACS) data. Reconstruction is performed by imposing the learned self-consistency and data-consistency, which enables sRAKI to support random undersampling patterns. Fully-sampled targeted right coronary artery MRI was acquired in six healthy subjects. The data were retrospectively undersampled, and reconstructed using SPIRiT, l1-SPIRiT and sRAKI for acceleration rates of 2 to 5. Additionally, prospectively undersampled whole-heart coronary MRI was acquired to further evaluate reconstruction performance. Results sRAKI reduces noise amplification and blurring artifacts compared with SPIRiT and l1-SPIRiT, especially at high acceleration rates in targeted coronary MRI. Quantitative analysis shows that sRAKI outperforms these techniques in terms of normalized mean-squared-error (~44% and ~21% over SPIRiT and l1-SPIRiT at rate 5) and vessel sharpness (~10% and ~20% over SPIRiT and l1-SPIRiT at rate 5). Whole-heart data shows the sharpest coronary arteries when resolved using sRAKI, with 11% and 15% improvement in vessel sharpness over SPIRiT and l1-SPIRiT, respectively. Conclusion sRAKI is a database-free neural network-based reconstruction technique that may further accelerate coronary MRI with arbitrary undersampling patterns, while improving noise resilience over linear parallel imaging and image sharpness over l1 regularization techniques.","",""

However, unlike typical signatures such as slow or sharp waves in ictal periods, the signal patterns in preictal periods are usually subtle, and highly individual-dependent. How to extract effective and robust preictal features is still a challenging problem. Most recently, graph convolutional neural network (GCNN) has demonstrated the strength in the electroencephalogram (EEG) and intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) signal modeling, due to its advantages in describing complex relationships among different EEG/iEEG regions. However, current GCNN models are not suitable for seizure prediction. The effectiveness of GCNNs highly relies on prior graphs that describe the underlying relationships in EEG regions. However, due to the complex mechanism of seizure evolution, the underlying relationship in the preictal period can be diverse in different patients, making it almost impossible to build a proper prior graph in general. To deal with this problem, we propose a novel approach to automatically learn a patient-specific graph in a data-driven way, which is called the joint graph structure and representation learning network (JGRN). JGRN constructs a global-local graph convolutional neural network which jointly learns the graph structures and connection weights in a task-related learning process in iEEG signals, thus the learned graph and feature representations can be optimized toward the objective of seizure prediction.

A robust experimental protocol based on the public Tobacco800 document image collection shows that the proposed method compares favor-ably against state-of-the-art document image retrieval methods, reaching 0.94 and 0.83 of mean average precision (mAP) for retrieval and pattern spotting (IoU=0.7), respectively. Besides, we have evaluated the proposed method considering feature maps of different sizes, showing the impact of reducing the number of features in the retrieval performance and time-consuming.","",""

In this work, we show that adversarially trained CNNs are more susceptible to failure due to hardware errors when compared to vanilla-trained models. We identify large differences in the quantization scaling factors of the CNNs which are resilient to hardware faults and those which are not. As adversarially trained CNNs learn robustness against input attack perturbations, their internal weight and activation distributions open a backdoor for injecting large magnitude hardware faults. We propose a simple weight decay remedy for adversarially trained models to maintain adversarial robustness and hardware resilience in the same CNN. We improve the fault resilience of an adversarially trained ResNet56 by 25% for large-scale bit-flip benchmarks on activation data while gaining slightly improved accuracy and adversarial robustness.","",""

The characteristics of existing one-class labels lead to a dilemma: it is hard to directly use a multiple classifier based on deep neural networks to solve one-class classification problems. Therefore, in this article, we propose a novel DeepOC neural network, termed as DeepOC, which can simultaneously learn compact feature representations and train a DeepOC classifier. Only with the given normal samples, we use the stacked convolutional encoder to generate their low-dimensional high-level features and train a one-class classifier to make these features as compact as possible. Meanwhile, for the sake of the correct mapping relation and the feature representations’ diversity, we utilize a decoder in order to reconstruct raw samples from these low-dimensional feature representations. This structure is gradually established using an adversarial mechanism during the training stage. This mechanism is the key to our model. It organically combines two seemingly contradictory components and allows them to take advantage of each other, thus making the model robust and effective. Unlike methods that use handcrafted features or those that are separated into two stages (extracting features and training classifiers), DeepOC is a one-stage model using reliable features that are automatically extracted by neural networks. Experiments on various benchmark data sets show that DeepOC is feasible and achieves the state-of-the-art anomaly detection results compared with a dozen existing methods.","",""

However, various working requirements and the oceanic environment may cause some uncertain and unfavorable factors for ship-mounted crane control. In particular, to accomplish different control tasks, some plant parameters (e.g., boom lengths, payload masses, and so on) frequently change; hence, most existing model-based controllers cannot ensure satisfactory control performance any longer. For example, inaccurate gravity compensation may result in positioning errors. Additionally, due to ship roll motions caused by sea waves, residual payload swing generally exists, which may result in safety risks in practice. To solve the above-mentioned issues, this paper designs a neural network-based adaptive control method that can provide effective control for both actuated and unactuated state variables based on the original nonlinear ship-mounted crane dynamics without any linearizing operations. In particular, the proposed update law availably compensates parameter/structure uncertainties for ship-mounted crane systems. Based on a 2-D sliding surface, the boom and rope can arrive at their preset positions in finite time, and the payload swing can be completely suppressed. Furthermore, the problem of nonlinear input dead zones is also taken into account. The stability of the equilibrium point of all state variables in ship-mounted crane systems is theoretically proven by a rigorous Lyapunov-based analysis. The hardware experimental results verify the practicability and robustness of the presented control approach.","",""

To combat the COVID-19 outbreak, developing a deep learning (DL) based model for automated COVID-19 diagnosis on chest X-ray is beneficial. In this research, we have proposed a customized convolutional neural network (CNN) model to detect COVID-19 from chest X-ray images.

It provides COVID-19 detection early so the patients can be admitted in a timely fashion. The proposed model was trained and tested on two publicly available datasets. Cross-dataset studies are used to assess the robustness in a real-world context. Six hundred X-ray images were used for training and two hundred X-rays were used for validation of the model. The X-ray images of the dataset were preprocessed to improve the results and visualized for better analysis. The developed algorithm reached 98% precision, recall and f1-score. The cross-dataset studies also demonstrate the resilience of deep learning algorithms in a real-world context with 98.5 percent accuracy.

Strikingly, NSPC differentiation rewires the cellular chaperone network, reducing TRiC/CCT levels and inducing those of the ATP-independent small heat shock proteins (sHSPs). This switches the proteostasis strategy in neural progeny cells to promote sequestration of misfolded proteins into protective inclusions. The chaperone network of NSPCs is more effective than that of differentiated cells, leading to improved management of proteotoxic stress and amyloidogenic proteins.

However, it suffers from slow convergence speed, heavy computational burden, and poor robustness to noise in nonlinear acoustic echo cancellation, especially in the double-talk scenario. To reduce its computational complexity and improve its robustness against impulsive noise, this paper develops a recursive adaptive sparse exponential TFLN (RASETFLN). Based on sparse representations of functional links, the robust proportionate adaptive algorithm is deduced from the robust cost function over the RASETFLN in impulsive noise environments. Theoretical analysis shows that the proposed RASETFLN is stable under certain conditions. Finally, computer simulations illustrate that the proposed RASETFLN achieves much improved performance over the AETFLN in several nonlinear scenarios in terms of convergence rate, steady-state error, and robustness against noise.","",""

Our visualization results offer insights on the generalization power and resilience of commonly used networks, such as VGG16, ResNet50, and DenseNet121. Our experiments on the AID and the UCM aerial datasets demonstrate the emergence of object and texture detectors in convolutional networks commonly used for classification. We further analyze these interpretations when the network is trained on one dataset and tested on another to demonstrate the robustness of feature learning across aerial datasets. We also explore the shift in interpretations when performing transfer learning from an aerial dataset (AID) to a generic object dataset (MS-COCO). These results illustrate how transfer learning benefits the network’s internal representations. For analyzing the effects of damages on activation maps, our work proposes to simulate damages by randomly zeroing network weights at different levels of the network. The paper carries out experiments with retraining the network to check if it can recover the lost interpretations. Visualizing changes in the neural network’s interpretation when the undamaged weights are updated, allows us to assess the resilience of a network visually.

Furthermore, for steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) BCI systems, multiple states (sub-states) exist within the IC state. Existing recognition methods rely on a threshold technique, which is difficult to realize high accuracy, i.e., simultaneously high true positive rate and low false positive rate. To address this issue, we proposed a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect IC and NC states in a SSVEP-BCI system for the first time. Specifically, the steady-state motion visual evoked potentials (SSMVEP) paradigm, which has been shown to induce less visual discomfort, was chosen as the experimental paradigm. Two processing pipelines were proposed for the detection of IC and NC states. The first one was using CNN as a multi-class classifier to discriminate between all the states in IC and NC state (FFT-CNN). The second one was using CNN to discriminate between IC and NC states, and using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to perform classification tasks within the IC (FFT-CNN-CCA). We demonstrated that both pipelines achieved a significant increase in accuracy for low-performance healthy participants when traditional algorithms such as CCA threshold were used. Furthermore, the FFT-CNN-CCA pipeline achieved better performance than the FFT-CNN pipeline based on the stroke patients’ data. In summary, we showed that CNN can be used for robust detection in an asynchronous SSMVEP-BCI with great potential for out-of-lab BCI applications.","",""

It is known that the disadvantages of robust control for the NARMA model are as follows: 1) suitable control parameters for larger time delay are more sensitive to achieving desirable performance; 2) it only deals with bounded uncertainty; and 3) the nominal NARMA model must be learned in advance. Due to the dynamic feature of the NARMA model, a recurrent neural network (RNN) is online applied to learn it. However, the system performance becomes deteriorated due to the poor learning of the larger variation of system vector functions. In this situation, a simple network is employed to compensate the upper bound of the residue caused by the linear parameterization of the approximation error of RNN.

The recognition of these patterns is made difficult by their substantial variation in cadence and duration. The neural circuit behaviors used are similar to those associated with brain neural integrators. In the larger context described here, this kind of circuit becomes a building block of an entirely different computational algorithm for solving complex problems. While the network behavior is simulated in detail, a collective view is essential to understanding the results. A closed equation of motion for the collective variable describes an algorithm that quantitatively accounts for many aspects of the emergent network computation. The feedback connections and ongoing activity in the network shape the collective dynamics onto a reduced dimensionality manifold of activity space, which defines the algorithm and computation actually performed. The external inputs are weak and are not the dominant drivers of network activity.","",""

We show how these algorithms can be exploited to successfully identify the nonlinearity in the system using neural-network models. By embedding the original problem in one with noise-perturbed state measurements, we present a class of identifiers (under L1 and L2 cost criteria) which secure a good approximant for the system nonlinearity provided that some global optimization technique is used.

However, in practice, spiking networks with multi-layer learning have proven difficult to train. This paper explores a novel, bio-inspired spiking convolutional neural network (CNN) that is trained in a greedy, layer-wise fashion. The spiking CNN consists of a convolutional/pooling layer followed by a feature discovery layer, both of which undergo bio-inspired learning. Kernels for the convolutional layer are trained using a sparse, spiking auto-encoder representing primary visual features. The feature discovery layer uses a probabilistic spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) learning rule. This layer represents complex visual features using WTA-thresholded, leaky, integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons. The new model is evaluated on the MNIST digit dataset using clean and noisy images. Intermediate results show that the convolutional layer is stack-admissible, enabling it to support a multi-layer learning architecture. The recognition performance for clean images is above 98%. This performance is accounted for by the independent and informative visual features extracted in a hierarchy of convolutional and feature discovery layers. The performance loss for recognizing the noisy images is in the range 0.1% to 8.5%. This level of performance loss indicates that the network is robust to additive noise.","",""

In this article, the deep neural evolution network is introduced to extract deep-hidden fault features from massive collected alarm information in cloud data center interconnection. It has the prominent capacity of global search without the constraint of gradient to realize the breakthrough of fault location accuracy. The fault location method based on deep neural evolution network (FL-DNEN) is applied which uses the alarm set and suspicious scope of fault getting from fault propagation model as input and export deterministic faults accurately.

Compactness provides efﬁciency and comprehensibil-ity whereas robustness provides resilience. Both topics have been studied in recent years but in isolation. Here we present a robust model compression scheme which is independent of model types: it can compress ensembles, neural networks and other types of models into diverse types of small mod- els. The main building block is the notion of depth derived from robust statistics. Originally, depth was introduced as a measure of the centrality of a point in a sample such that the median is the deepest point. This concept was extended to classiﬁcation functions which makes it possible to deﬁne the depth of a hypothesis and the median hypothesis. Algo- rithms have been suggested to approximate the median but they have been limited to binary classiﬁcation. In this study, we present a new algorithm, the Multiclass Empirical Median Optimization (MEMO) algorithm that ﬁnds a deep hypothesis in multi-class tasks, and prove its correctness. This leads to our Compact Robust Estimated Median Belief Optimization (CREMBO) algorithm for robust model compres- sion. We demonstrate the success of this algorithm empirically by compressing neural networks and random forests into small decision trees, which are interpretable models, and show that they are more accurate and robust than other com- parable methods. In addition, our empirical study shows that our method outperforms Knowledge Distillation on DNN to DNN compression.","",""

Applications in robotics bring stringent constraints on size, weight and power constraints (SWaP), which challenge the developers of these technologies in new ways.

A number of graph robustness metrics have been introduced to measure network resilience against such attacks. One way to improve resilience against such challenges is to add a set of links to improve these graph robustness metrics. In this paper, we add links to a given graph to improve given robustness functions. Then, we evaluate non- and improved graphs by applying centrality-based attacks to examine their resilience.

Based on many known properties of cortical neurons, hierarchical temporal memory (HTM) sequence memory recently has been proposed as a theoretical framework for sequence learning in the cortex. In this letter, we analyze properties of HTM sequence memory and apply it to sequence learning and prediction problems with streaming data. We show the model is able to continuously learn a large number of variable order temporal sequences using an unsupervised Hebbian-like learning rule. The sparse temporal codes formed by the model can robustly handle branching temporal sequences by maintaining multiple predictions until there is sufficient disambiguating evidence. We compare the HTM sequence memory with other sequence learning algorithms, including statistical methods—autoregressive integrated moving average; feedforward neural networks—time delay neural network and online sequential extreme learning machine; and recurrent neural networks—long short-term memory and echo-state networks on sequence prediction problems with both artificial and real-world data. The HTM model achieves comparable accuracy to other state-of-the-art algorithms. The model also exhibits properties that are critical for sequence learning, including continuous online learning, the ability to handle multiple predictions and branching sequences with high-order statistics, robustness to sensor noise and fault tolerance, and good performance without task-specific hyperparameter tuning. Therefore, the HTM sequence memory not only advances our understanding of how the brain may solve the sequence learning problem but is also applicable to real-world sequence learning problems from continuous data streams.","",""

To handle these issues and massive amounts of data, we propose a nonparametric density estimator that rapidly learns data online and has high robustness. Our approach is an extension of both kernel density estimation (KDE) and a self-organizing incremental neural network (SOINN); therefore, we call our approach KDESOINN. An SOINN provides a clustering method that learns about the given data as networks of prototype of data; more specifically, an SOINN can learn the distribution underlying the given data. Using this information, KDESOINN estimates the probability density function.

A recurrent neural network (RNN) is powerful to learn the large-span dynamics of a word sequence in the continuous space. However, the training of the RNN-LM is an ill-posed problem because of too many parameters from a large dictionary size and a high-dimensional hidden layer. This paper presents a Bayesian approach to regularize the RNN-LM and apply it for continuous speech recognition. We aim to penalize the too complicated RNN-LM by compensating for the uncertainty of the estimated model parameters, which is represented by a Gaussian prior. The objective function in a Bayesian classification network is formed as the regularized cross-entropy error function. The regularized model is constructed not only by calculating the regularized parameters according to the maximum a posteriori criterion but also by estimating the Gaussian hyperparameter by maximizing the marginal likelihood. A rapid approximation to a Hessian matrix is developed to implement the Bayesian RNN-LM (BRNN-LM) by selecting a small set of salient outer-products. The proposed BRNN-LM achieves a sparser model than the RNN-LM. Experiments on different corpora show the robustness of system performance by applying the rapid BRNN-LM under different conditions.","",""
