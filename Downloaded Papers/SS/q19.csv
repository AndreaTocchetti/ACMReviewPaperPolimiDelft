The purpose of this work was to investigate robustness and repeatability of the artificial intelligence-assisted online segmentation and adaptive planning process on the Varian Ethos adaptive platform, and to develop an end-to-end test strategy for online adaptive radiation therapy. Five synthetic deformations were generated and applied to a computed tomography image of an anthropomorphic pelvis phantom, and reference treatment plans were generated from each of the resulting deformed images. The undeformed phantom was repeatedly imaged, and the online adaptive process was performed including auto-segmentation, review and manual correction of contours, and adaptive plan creation. One adaptive fractions in five different deformation scenarios were performed. The manually corrected contours had a high degree of consistency (> 93% Dice similarity coefficient and < 1.0 mm mean surface distance) across repeated fractions, with no significant variation across the synthetic deformation instance except for bowel (p = 0.026, one-way ANOVA). Adaptive treatment plans also resulted in highly consistent dose-volume values for targets and organs at risk. A straightforward and efficient process was developed and used to quantify a set of organ specific contouring and dosimetric action levels to help establish uncertainty bounds for an end-to-end test on the Varian Ethos system.","",""

Indeed, poor data reproducibility and quality have been frequently cited as factors contributing to the crisis in biomedical research, as well as similar shortcomings in the fields of toxicology and chemistry. In this article, we review the most recent efforts to improve confidence in the robustness of toxicological data and investigate the impact that data curation has on the confidence in model predictions. We also present two case studies demonstrating the effect of data curation on the performance of AI models for predicting skin sensitisation and skin irritation. We show that, whereas models generated with uncurated data had a 7–24% higher correct classification rate (CCR), the perceived performance was, in fact, inflated owing to the high number of duplicates in the training set. We assert that data curation is a critical step in building computational models, to help ensure that reliable predictions of chemical toxicity are achieved through use of the models.","",""

However, it lacks specificity, and its inter-reader reproducibility remains moderate. Biomarkers, such as the Prostate Health Index (PHI), may help select patients for prostate biopsy. Computer-aided diagnosis/detection (CAD) systems may also improve mpMRI interpretation. Different prototypes of CAD systems are currently developed under the Recherche Hospitalo-Universitaire en Santé / Personalized Focused Ultrasound Surgery of Localized Prostate Cancer (RHU PERFUSE) research programme, tackling challenging issues such as robustness across imaging protocols and magnetic resonance (MR) vendors, and ability to characterise cancer aggressiveness. The study primary objective is to evaluate the non-inferiority of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the final CAD system as compared with the Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System V.2.1 (PI-RADS V.2.1) in predicting the presence of ISUP ≥2 prostate cancer in patients undergoing prostate biopsy. Methods This prospective, multicentre, non-inferiority trial will include 420 men with suspected prostate cancer, a prostate-specific antigen level of ≤30 ng/mL and a clinical stage ≤T2 c. Included men will undergo prostate mpMRI that will be interpreted using the PI-RADS V.2.1 score. Then, they will undergo systematic and targeted biopsy. PHI will be assessed before biopsy. At the end of patient inclusion, MR images will be assessed by the final version of the CAD system developed under the RHU PERFUSE programme. Key secondary outcomes include the prediction of ISUP grade ≥2 prostate cancer during a 3-year follow-up, and the number of biopsy procedures saved and ISUP grade ≥2 cancers missed by several diagnostic pathways combining PHI and MRI findings. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval was obtained from the Comité de Protection des Personnes Nord Ouest III (ID-RCB: 2020-A02785-34).

As deep learning is mastering computer vision tasks, its application to digital pathology is natural, with the promise of aiding in routine reporting and standardizing results across trials. Deep learning features inferred from digital pathology scans can improve validity and robustness of current clinico-pathological features, up to identifying novel histological patterns, e.g. from tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. In this study, we examine the issue of evaluating accuracy of predictive models from deep learning features in digital pathology, as an hallmark of reproducibility. We introduce the DAPPER framework for validation based on a rigorous Data Analysis Plan derived from the FDA’s MAQC project, designed to analyse causes of variability in predictive biomarkers. We apply the framework on models that identify tissue of origin on 787 Whole Slide Images from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. We test 3 different deep learning architectures (VGG, ResNet, Inception) as feature extractors and three classifiers (a fully connected multilayer, Support Vector Machine and Random Forests) and work with 4 datasets (5, 10, 20 or 30 classes), for a total 53000 tiles at 512 × 512 resolution. We analyze accuracy and feature stability of the machine learning classifiers, also demonstrating the need for random features and random labels diagnostic tests to identify selection bias and risks for reproducibility. Further, we use the deep features from the VGG model from GTEx on the KIMIA24 dataset for identification of slide of origin (24 classes) to train a classifier on 1060 annotated tiles and validated on 265 unseen ones. The DAPPER software, including its deep learning backbone pipeline and the HINT (Histological Imaging - Newsy Tiles) benchmark dataset derived from GTEx, is released as a basis for standardization and validation initiatives in AI for Digital Pathology. Author summary In this study, we examine the issue of evaluating accuracy of predictive models from deep learning features in digital pathology, as an hallmark of reproducibility.

Materials and Methods A total of 277 patients with nonmetastatic NPC admitted between March 2008 and December 2014 at two imaging centers were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were allocated to a discovery or validation cohort based on where they underwent MRI (discovery cohort, n = 217; validation cohort, n = 60). A total of 525 radiomics features extracted from contrast material-enhanced T1- or T2-weighted MRI studies and five clinical features were subjected to radiomic machine learning modeling to predict 3-year disease progression. Feature selection was performed by analyzing robustness to resampling, reproducibility between observers, and redundancy. Features for the final model were selected with Kaplan-Meier analysis and the log-rank test. A support vector machine was used as the classifier for the model. To interpret the pattern learned from the model, Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) was applied.   Results The final model yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.80 in both the discovery (95% bootstrap confidence interval: 0.80, 0.81) and independent validation (95% bootstrap confidence interval: 0.73, 0.89) cohorts. Analysis with SHAP revealed that tumor shape sphericity, first-order mean absolute deviation, T stage, and overall stage were important factors in 3-year disease progression.   Conclusion These results add to the growing evidence of the role of radiomics in the assessment of NPC. By using explanatory techniques, such as SHAP, the complex interaction of features learned by the model may be understood.© RSNA, 2019Supplemental material is available for this article.","",""

Owing to their unique features, including low cost of production, easy chemical modification, high thermal stability, reproducibility, as well as low levels of immunogenicity and toxicity, aptamers can be used as an alternative to antibodies in diagnostics and therapeutics. Systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX), an experimental approach for aptamer screening, allows the selection and identification of in vitro aptamers with high affinity and specificity. However, the SELEX process is time consuming and characterization of the representative aptamer candidates from SELEX is rather laborious. Artificial intelligence (AI) could help to rapidly identify the potential aptamer candidates from a vast number of sequences. This review discusses the advancements of AI pipelines/methods, including structure-based and machine/deep learning-based methods, for predicting the binding ability of aptamers to targets. Structure-based methods are the most used in computer-aided drug design. For this part, we review the secondary and tertiary structure prediction methods for aptamers, molecular docking, as well as molecular dynamic simulation methods for aptamer–target binding. We also performed analysis to compare the accuracy of different secondary and tertiary structure prediction methods for aptamers. On the other hand, advanced machine-/deep-learning models have witnessed successes in predicting the binding abilities between targets and ligands in drug discovery and thus potentially offer a robust and accurate approach to predict the binding between aptamers and targets. The research utilizing machine-/deep-learning techniques for prediction of aptamer–target binding is limited currently. Therefore, perspectives for models, algorithms, and implementation strategies of machine/deep learning-based methods are discussed.

For the WQI prediction, artificial neural network models, namely nonlinear autoregressive neural network (NARNET) and long short-term memory (LSTM) deep learning algorithm, have been developed. In addition, three machine learning algorithms, namely, support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbor (K-NN), and Naive Bayes, have been used for the WQC forecasting. The used dataset has 7 significant parameters, and the developed models were evaluated based on some statistical parameters. The results revealed that the proposed models can accurately predict WQI and classify the water quality according to superior robustness. Prediction results demonstrated that the NARNET model performed slightly better than the LSTM for the prediction of the WQI values and the SVM algorithm has achieved the highest accuracy (97.01%) for the WQC prediction.

However, health care has been relatively late to adopt them. This article provides clinical examples in which machine learning and artificial intelligence are already in use in health care and appear to deliver benefit. Three key bottlenecks toward increasing the pace of diffusion and adoption are methodological issues in evaluation of artificial intelligence-based interventions, reporting standards to enable assessment of model performance, and issues that need to be addressed for an institution to adopt these interventions. Methodological best practices will include external validation, ideally at a different site; use of proactive learning algorithms to correct for site-specific biases and increase robustness as algorithms are deployed across multiple sites; addressing subgroup performance; and communicating to providers the uncertainty of predictions. Regarding reporting, especially important issues are the extent to which implementing standardized approaches for introducing clinical decision support has been followed, describing the data sources, reporting on data assumptions, and addressing biases. Although most health care organizations in the United States have adopted electronic health records, they may be ill prepared to adopt machine learning and artificial intelligence. Several steps can enable this: preparing data, developing tools to get suggestions to clinicians in useful ways, and getting clinicians engaged in the process. Open challenges and the role of regulation in this area are briefly discussed.

However, visual scoring systems as an outcome measure are time consuming, require training and lack high reproducibility. Our objective was to validate a fully automated artificial intelligence (AI)-driven scoring system of CF lung disease severity. Methods Data were retrospectively collected in three CF reference centres, between 2008 and 2020, in 184 patients aged 4–54 years. An algorithm using three 2D convolutional neural networks was trained with 78 patients’ CT scans (23 530 CT slices) for the semantic labelling of bronchiectasis, peribronchial thickening, bronchial mucus, bronchiolar mucus and collapse/consolidation. 36 patients’ CT scans (11 435 CT slices) were used for testing versus ground-truth labels. The method's clinical validity was assessed in an independent group of 70 patients with or without lumacaftor/ivacaftor treatment (n=10 and n=60, respectively) with repeat examinations. Similarity and reproducibility were assessed using the Dice coefficient, correlations using the Spearman test, and paired comparisons using the Wilcoxon rank test. Results The overall pixelwise similarity of AI-driven versus ground-truth labels was good (Dice 0.71). All AI-driven volumetric quantifications had moderate to very good correlations to a visual imaging scoring (p<0.001) and fair to good correlations to forced expiratory volume in 1 s % predicted at pulmonary function tests (p<0.001). Significant decreases in peribronchial thickening (p=0.005), bronchial mucus (p=0.005) and bronchiolar mucus (p=0.007) volumes were measured in patients with lumacaftor/ivacaftor.

However, this approach is valid for monotonic transformation and narrow-banded processes. When the bandwidth of a random process is wide, no reasonable methods are available for acquiring the extreme value. This paper therefore applies the artificial neural network and genetic algorithm to do the extreme value prediction, without seeking rigorous mathematical derivations. Not only skewness and kurtosis are used, the spectral moments up to 4th-order reflecting bandwidth effects are also adopted.

These specialized ICU departments include Coronary Care, Cardiac Surgery Recovery, Medical Intensive Care, Surgical Intensive Care, and Trauma Surgical Intensive Care units. MIMIC is populated with data from hospital electronic health records, automated critical care information systems, and the Social Security Administration Death Master File. The two critical care information systems which provided time-stamped physiological measurements and progress notes were the Philips CareVue Clinical Information System and iMDsoft MetaVision ICU.

Objectives: Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have emerged as disruptive technologies with the potential to drastically affect clinical decision making in spine surgery. AI can enhance the delivery of spine care in several arenas: (1) preoperative patient workup, patient selection, and outcome prediction; (2) quality and reproducibility of spine research; (3) perioperative surgical assistance and data tracking optimization; and (4) intraoperative surgical performance. The purpose of this narrative review is to concisely assemble, analyze, and discuss current trends and applications of AI and ML in conventional and robotic-assisted spine surgery. Methods: We conducted a comprehensive PubMed search of peer-reviewed articles that were published between 2006 and 2019 examining AI, ML, and robotics in spine surgery. Key findings were then compiled and summarized in this review. Results: The majority of the published AI literature in spine surgery has focused on predictive analytics and supervised image recognition for radiographic diagnosis. Several investigators have studied the use of AI/ML in the perioperative setting in small patient cohorts; pivotal trials are still pending. Conclusions: Artificial intelligence has tremendous potential in revolutionizing comprehensive spine care. Evidence-based, predictive analytics can help surgeons improve preoperative patient selection, surgical indications, and individualized postoperative care. Robotic-assisted surgery, while still in early stages of development, has the potential to reduce surgeon fatigue and improve technical precision.","",""

OBJECTIVE.— To evaluate the application and clinical implementation of a state-of-the-art deep learning-based artificial intelligence algorithm (LYmph Node Assistant or LYNA) for detection of metastatic breast cancer in sentinel lymph node biopsies.   DESIGN.— Whole slide images were obtained from hematoxylin-eosin-stained lymph nodes from 399 patients (publicly available Camelyon16 challenge dataset). LYNA was developed by using 270 slides and evaluated on the remaining 129 slides. We compared the findings to those obtained from an independent laboratory (108 slides from 20 patients/86 blocks) using a different scanner to measure reproducibility.   RESULTS.— LYNA achieved a slide-level area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) of 99% and a tumor-level sensitivity of 91% at 1 false positive per patient on the Camelyon16 evaluation dataset. We also identified 2 ""normal"" slides that contained micrometastases. When applied to our second dataset, LYNA achieved an AUC of 99.6%. LYNA was not affected by common histology artifacts such as overfixation, poor staining, and air bubbles.   CONCLUSIONS.— Artificial intelligence algorithms can exhaustively evaluate every tissue patch on a slide, achieving higher tumor-level sensitivity than, and comparable slide-level performance to, pathologists. These techniques may improve the pathologist's productivity and reduce the number of false negatives associated with morphologic detection of tumor cells. We provide a framework to aid practicing pathologists in assessing such algorithms for adoption into their workflow (akin to how a pathologist assesses immunohistochemistry results).","",""

Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms play a vital role in the automated detection, segmentation, and computer-aided diagnosis of malignant lesions. Among the existing algorithms, radiomics and deep-learning-based types appear to show the most promise. Radiomics is a growing field related to the extraction of a set of features from an image, which allows for automated classification of medical images into a predefined group. The process comprises a series of consecutive steps including image acquisition and pre-processing, segmentation of the desired region of interest, calculation of defined features, feature engineering, and construction of the classification model. The features calculated in this process are mainly shape features, as well as first- and higher-order texture features. To date, more than 100 features have been defined, although this number varies depending on the application. The greatest challenge in radiomics is building a cross-validated model based on a selected set of calculated features known as the radiomic signature. Numerous radiomic signatures have successfully been developed; however, reproducibility and clinical validity of the results obtained constitutes a considerable challenge of modern radiomics. Deep learning algorithms are another rapidly evolving technique and are recognized as a valuable tool in the field of medical image analysis for the detection, characterization, and assessment of lesions. Such an approach involves the design of artificial neural network architecture while upholding the goal of high classification accuracy.

Here, tailoring ligand chemistry can alter preferred spin or oxidation states as well as electronic structure properties and reactivity, creating vast regions of chemical space to explore when designing new materials atom by atom. Although first-principles density functional theory (DFT) remains the workhorse of computational chemistry in mechanism deduction and property prediction, it is of limited use here. DFT is both far too computationally costly for widespread exploration of transition-metal chemical space and also prone to inaccuracies that limit its predictive performance for localized d electrons in transition-metal complexes. These challenges starkly contrast with the well-trodden regions of small-organic-molecule chemical space, where the analytical forms of molecular mechanics force fields and semiempirical theories have for decades accelerated the discovery of new molecules, accurate DFT functional performance has been demonstrated, and gold-standard methods from correlated wavefunction theory can predict experimental results to chemical accuracy.The combined promise of transition-metal chemical space exploration and lack of established tools has mandated a distinct approach. In this Account, we outline the path we charted in exploration of transition-metal chemical space starting from the first machine learning (ML) models (i.e., artificial neural network and kernel ridge regression) and representations for the prediction of open-shell transition-metal complex properties. The distinct importance of the immediate coordination environment of the metal center as well as the lack of low-level methods to accurately predict structural properties in this coordination environment first motivated and then benefited from these ML models and representations. Once developed, the recipe for prediction of geometric, spin state, and redox potential properties was straightforwardly extended to a diverse range of other properties, including in catalysis, computational ""feasibility"", and the gas separation properties of periodic metal-organic frameworks. Interpretation of selected features most important for model prediction revealed new ways to encapsulate design rules and confirmed that models were robustly mapping essential structure-property relationships. Encountering the special challenge of ensuring that good model performance could generalize to new discovery targets motivated investigation of how to best carry out model uncertainty quantification. Distance-based approaches, whether in model latent space or in carefully engineered feature space, provided intuitive measures of the domain of applicability. With all of these pieces together, ML can be harnessed as an engine to tackle the large-scale exploration of transition-metal chemical space needed to satisfy multiple objectives using efficient global optimization methods. In practical terms, bringing these artificial intelligence tools to bear on the problems of transition-metal chemical space exploration has resulted in ML-model assessments of large, multimillion compound spaces in minutes and validated new design leads in weeks instead of decades.","",""

However, it remains challenging to quantify the correctness of their interpretability as current evaluation approaches either require subjective input from humans or incur high computation cost with automated evaluation. In this paper, we propose backdoor trigger patterns--hidden malicious functionalities that cause misclassification--to automate the evaluation of saliency explanations. Our key observation is that triggers provide ground truth for inputs to evaluate whether the regions identified by an XAI method are truly relevant to its output. Since backdoor triggers are the most important features that cause deliberate misclassification, a robust XAI method should reveal their presence at inference time. We introduce three complementary metrics for the systematic evaluation of explanations that an XAI method generates. We evaluate seven state-of-the-art model-free and model-specific post-hoc methods through 36 models trojaned with specifically crafted triggers using color, shape, texture, location, and size. We found six methods that use local explanation and feature relevance fail to completely highlight trigger regions, and only a model-free approach can uncover the entire trigger region.

All patients underwent dual-energy CEM examination in both craniocaudally (CC) and double acquisition of mediolateral oblique (MLO) projections (early and late). The reference standard was pathology from a surgical specimen for malignant lesions and pathology from a surgical specimen or fine needle aspiration cytology, core or Tru-Cut needle biopsy, and vacuum assisted breast biopsy for benign lesions. In total, 104 samples of 80 patients were analyzed. Furthermore, 48 textural parameters were extracted by manually segmenting regions of interest.

SUMMARY ANSWER We have combined computer vision image processing methods and deep learning techniques to create the non-invasive Life Whisperer AI model for robust prediction of embryo viability, as measured by clinical pregnancy outcome, using single static images of Day 5 blastocysts obtained from standard optical light microscope systems. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY Embryo selection following IVF is a critical factor in determining the success of ensuing pregnancy. Traditional morphokinetic grading by trained embryologists can be subjective and variable, and other complementary techniques, such as time-lapse imaging, require costly equipment and have not reliably demonstrated predictive ability for the endpoint of clinical pregnancy. AI methods are being investigated as a promising means for improving embryo selection and predicting implantation and pregnancy outcomes. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION These studies involved analysis of retrospectively collected data including standard optical light microscope images and clinical outcomes of 8886 embryos from 11 different IVF clinics, across three different countries, between 2011 and 2018. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS The AI-based model was trained using static two-dimensional optical light microscope images with known clinical pregnancy outcome as measured by fetal heartbeat to provide a confidence score for prediction of pregnancy. Predictive accuracy was determined by evaluating sensitivity, specificity and overall weighted accuracy, and was visualized using histograms of the distributions of predictions. Comparison to embryologists’ predictive accuracy was performed using a binary classification approach and a 5-band ranking comparison. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE The Life Whisperer AI model showed a sensitivity of 70.1% for viable embryos while maintaining a specificity of 60.5% for non-viable embryos across three independent blind test sets from different clinics. The weighted overall accuracy in each blind test set was >63%, with a combined accuracy of 64.3% across both viable and non-viable embryos, demonstrating model robustness and generalizability beyond the result expected from chance. Distributions of predictions showed clear separation of correctly and incorrectly classified embryos. Binary comparison of viable/non-viable embryo classification demonstrated an improvement of 24.7% over embryologists’ accuracy (P = 0.047, n = 2, Student’s t test), and 5-band ranking comparison demonstrated an improvement of 42.0% over embryologists (P = 0.028, n = 2, Student’s t test). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION The AI model developed here is limited to analysis of Day 5 embryos; therefore, further evaluation or modification of the model is needed to incorporate information from different time points. The endpoint described is clinical pregnancy as measured by fetal heartbeat, and this does not indicate the probability of live birth. The current investigation was performed with retrospectively collected data, and hence it will be of importance to collect data prospectively to assess real-world use of the AI model. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS These studies demonstrated an improved predictive ability for evaluation of embryo viability when compared with embryologists’ traditional morphokinetic grading methods. The superior accuracy of the Life Whisperer AI model could lead to improved pregnancy success rates in IVF when used in a clinical setting. It could also potentially assist in standardization of embryo selection methods across multiple clinical environments, while eliminating the need for complex time-lapse imaging equipment. Finally, the cloud-based software application used to apply the Life Whisperer AI model in clinical practice makes it broadly applicable and globally scalable to IVF clinics worldwide.

Measurements performed by the human examiner and by CEFBOT were not statistically different.   CONCLUSION Within the limitations of our methodology, we concluded that the AI contained in the CEFBOT software can be considered a promising tool for enhancing the capacities of human Radiologists.","",""

With the recent rise in volume of research using artificial intelligence (AI), additional factors need to be evaluated, which do not neatly conform to traditional reporting guidelines (eg, details relating to technical algorithm development). In this review, reporting guidelines are highlighted to promote awareness of essential content required for studies evaluating AI interventions in healthcare. These include published and in progress extensions to well-known reporting guidelines such as Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials-AI (study protocols), Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials-AI (randomised controlled trials), Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-AI (diagnostic accuracy studies) and Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis-AI (prediction model studies). Additionally there are a number of guidelines that consider AI for health interventions more generally (eg, Checklist for Artificial Intelligence in Medical Imaging (CLAIM), minimum information (MI)-CLAIM, MI for Medical AI Reporting) or address a specific element such as the ‘learning curve’ (Developmental and Exploratory Clinical Investigation of Decision-AI) . Economic evaluation of AI health interventions is not currently addressed, and may benefit from extension to an existing guideline. In the face of a rapid influx of studies of AI health interventions, reporting guidelines help ensure that investigators and those appraising studies consider both the well-recognised elements of good study design and reporting, while also adequately addressing new challenges posed by AI-specific elements.","",""

In this context, the data-driven approach has gained prominence due to its provision of insights for decision-making and easy implementation. The data-driven approach can discover various database patterns without relying on prior knowledge while also handling flexible objectives and multiple scenarios. This chapter reviews recent advances in data-driven optimization, highlighting the promise of data-driven optimization that integrates mathematical programming and machine learning (ML) for decision-making under uncertainty and identifies potential research opportunities.

In recent years, a rapid evolution of artificial intelligence in image recognition has been evident in its broad applications in modern society, offering new opportunities for increasing the capabilities of coral reef monitoring. Here, we evaluated the performance of Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Networks for automated image analysis, using a global coral reef monitoring dataset. The study demonstrates the advantages of automated image analysis for coral reef monitoring in terms of error and repeatability of benthic abundance estimations, as well as cost and benefit. We found unbiased and high agreement between expert and automated observations (97%). Repeated surveys and comparisons against existing monitoring programs also show that automated estimation of benthic composition is equally robust in detecting change and ensuring the continuity of existing monitoring data. Using this automated approach, data analysis and reporting can be accelerated by at least 200x and at a fraction of the cost (1%). Combining commonly used underwater imagery in monitoring with automated image annotation can dramatically improve how we measure and monitor coral reefs worldwide, particularly in terms of allocating limited resources, rapid reporting and data integration within and across management areas.","",""

Objective The purpose of this systematic literature review was to identify and analyze quantitative studies utilizing or integrating AI to address and report clinical-level patient safety outcomes. Methods We restricted our search to the PubMed, PubMed Central, and Web of Science databases to retrieve research articles published in English between January 2009 and August 2019. We focused on quantitative studies that reported positive, negative, or intermediate changes in patient safety outcomes using AI apps, specifically those based on machine-learning algorithms and natural language processing. Quantitative studies reporting only AI performance but not its influence on patient safety outcomes were excluded from further review. Results We identified 53 eligible studies, which were summarized concerning their patient safety subcategories, the most frequently used AI, and reported performance metrics. Recognized safety subcategories were clinical alarms (n=9; mainly based on decision tree models), clinical reports (n=21; based on support vector machine models), and drug safety (n=23; mainly based on decision tree models). Analysis of these 53 studies also identified two essential findings: (1) the lack of a standardized benchmark and (2) heterogeneity in AI reporting. Conclusions This systematic review indicates that AI-enabled decision support systems, when implemented correctly, can aid in enhancing patient safety by improving error detection, patient stratification, and drug management. Future work is still needed for robust validation of these systems in prospective and real-world clinical environments to understand how well AI can predict safety outcomes in health care settings.","",""

We examined the model performance of atomic convolutional neural network (ACNN) on the PDBbind core set and achieved a Pearson R2 of 0.73 between experimental and predicted binding affinities. Strikingly, the ACNN models did not require learning the essential protein-ligand interactions in complex structures and achieved similar performance even on datasets containing only ligand structures or only protein structures, while data splitting based on similarity clustering (protein sequence or ligand scaffold) significantly reduced the model performance. We also identified the property and topology biases in the DUD-E dataset which led to the artificially increased enrichment performance of virtual screening. The property bias in DUD-E was reduced by enforcing the more stringent ligand property matching rules, while the topology bias still exists due to the use of molecular fingerprint similarity as a decoy selection criterion. Therefore, we believe that sufficiently large and unbiased datasets are desirable for training robust AI models to accurately predict protein-ligand interactions.","",""

We focus on two aspects of clinical artificial intelligence used for decision-making: moral accountability for harm to patients; and safety assurance to protect patients against such harm. Artificial intelligence-based tools are challenging the standard clinical practices of assigning blame and assuring safety. Human clinicians and safety engineers have weaker control over the decisions reached by artificial intelligence systems and less knowledge and understanding of precisely how the artificial intelligence systems reach their decisions. We illustrate this analysis by applying it to an example of an artificial intelligence-based system developed for use in the treatment of sepsis. The paper ends with practical suggestions for ways forward to mitigate these concerns. We argue for a need to include artificial intelligence developers and systems safety engineers in our assessments of moral accountability for patient harm. Meanwhile, none of the actors in the model robustly fulfil the traditional conditions of moral accountability for the decisions of an artificial intelligence system. We should therefore update our conceptions of moral accountability in this context. We also need to move from a static to a dynamic model of assurance, accepting that considerations of safety are not fully resolvable during the design of the artificial intelligence system before the system has been deployed.","",""

Considering that echocardiography often is affected by inter-observer variability and shows a strong dependence on the level of experience, AI could be extremely advantageous in minimizing observer variation and providing reproducible measures, enabling accurate diagnosis. Currently, most reported AI applications in echocardiographic measurement have focused on improved image acquisition and automation of repetitive and tedious tasks; however, the role of AI applications should not be limited to conventional processes. Rather, AI could provide clinically important insights from subtle and non-specific data, such as changes in myocardial texture in patients with myocardial disease. Recent initiatives to develop large echocardiographic databases can facilitate development of AI applications. The ultimate goal of applying AI to echocardiography is automation of the entire process of echocardiogram analysis.

Flow simulation for fractured reservoirs is typically time-consuming due to the inherent high nonlinearity.

We employ an artificial intelligence (AI) aided proxy modeling framework for waterfront tracking in complex fractured carbonate reservoirs. The framework utilizes deep neural networks and reduced-order modeling to achieve an efficient representation of the reservoir dynamics to track and determine the fluid flow patterns within the fracture network. The AI-proxy model is examined on a synthetic two-dimensional (2D) fractured carbonate reservoir model. Training dataset including saturation and pressure maps at a series of time steps is generated using a dual-porosity dual-permeability (DPDP) model. Experimental results indicate a robust performance of the AI-aided proxy model, which successfully reproduce the key flow patterns within the reservoir and achieve orders of shorter running time than the full-order reservoir simulation.

This advanced AI algorithm-implemented LAMP (ai-LAMP) assay, targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene, showed high analytical sensitivity and specificity for SARS-CoV-2. A total of ~200 coronavirus disease (CoVID-19)-suspected NHS patient samples were tested using the platform and it was shown to be reliable, highly specific and significantly more sensitive than the current gold standard qRT-PCR. Therefore, this system could provide an efficient and cost-effective platform to detect SARS-CoV-2 in resource-limited laboratories.","",""

This paper reviews the pertinent aspects of AI in obstetrics and gynecology (OB/GYN) and how these can be applied to improve patient outcomes and reduce the healthcare costs and workload for clinicians. Herein, we will address current AI uses in OB/GYN, and the use of AI as a tool to interpret fetal heart rate (FHR) and cardiotocography (CTG) to aid in the detection of preterm labor, pregnancy complications, and review discrepancies in its interpretation between clinicians to reduce maternal and infant morbidity and mortality. AI systems can be used as tools to create algorithms identifying asymptomatic women with short cervical length who are at risk of preterm birth. Additionally, the benefits of using the vast data capacity of AI storage can assist in determining the risk factors for preterm labor using multiomics and extensive genomic data. In the field of gynecological surgery, the use of augmented reality helps surgeons detect vital structures, thus decreasing complications, reducing operative time, and helping surgeons in training to practice in a realistic setting. Using three-dimensional (3D) printers can provide materials that mimic real tissues and also helps trainees to practice on a realistic model. Furthermore, 3D imaging allows better depth perception than its two-dimensional (2D) counterpart, allowing the surgeon to create preoperative plans according to tissue depth and dimensions. Although AI has some limitations, this new technology can improve the prognosis and management of patients, reduce healthcare costs, and help OB/GYN practitioners to reduce their workload and increase their efficiency and accuracy by incorporating AI systems into their daily practice. AI has the potential to guide practitioners in decision-making, reaching a diagnosis, and improving case management. It can reduce healthcare costs by decreasing medical errors and providing more dependable predictions. AI systems can accurately provide information on the large array of patients in clinical settings, although more robust data is required.","",""

As the first step, the AVI trace is segregated into observation pairs using the Maximum Likelihood Estimation and then it is further joined with GPS co-ordinates to tackle the sparse issues. As the next step, the heterogeneity and correlation between the various pairs are determined using Mixed Logit model.

A decision tree (DT) model to predict COVID-19 length of stay was developed based on patient clinical information. The model showed very good performance with a coefficient of determination R2 of 49.8% and a median absolute deviation of 2.85 days.

Further validation using unsupervised learning methods showed similar separation patterns, and a receiver operator characteristic approach suggested stable and robust DT model performance.

One extensively used method to minimize the cost and time for the drug development process is computer-aided drug design (CADD). CADD allows better focusing on experiments, which can reduce the time and cost involved in researching new drugs. In this context, structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) is robust and useful and is one of the most promising in silico techniques for drug design. SBVS attempts to predict the best interaction mode between two molecules to form a stable complex, and it uses scoring functions to estimate the force of non-covalent interactions between a ligand and molecular target. Thus, scoring functions are the main reason for the success or failure of SBVS software. Many software programs are used to perform SBVS, and since they use different algorithms, it is possible to obtain different results from different software using the same input. In the last decade, a new technique of SBVS called consensus virtual screening (CVS) has been used in some studies to increase the accuracy of SBVS and to reduce the false positives obtained in these experiments. An indispensable condition to be able to utilize SBVS is the availability of a 3D structure of the target protein. Some virtual databases, such as the Protein Data Bank, have been created to store the 3D structures of molecules. However, sometimes it is not possible to experimentally obtain the 3D structure. In this situation, the homology modeling methodology allows the prediction of the 3D structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence. This review presents an overview of the challenges involved in the use of CADD to perform SBVS, the areas where CADD tools support SBVS, a comparison between the most commonly used tools, and the techniques currently used in an attempt to reduce the time and cost in the drug development process.

The word-of-machine effect stems from a lay belief that AI recommenders are more competent than human recommenders in the utilitarian realm and less competent than human recommenders in the hedonic realm. As a consequence, importance or salience of utilitarian attributes determine preference for AI recommenders over human ones, and importance or salience of hedonic attributes determine resistance to AI recommenders over human ones (Studies 1–4). The word-of machine effect is robust to attribute complexity, number of options considered, and transaction costs. The word-of-machine effect reverses for utilitarian goals if a recommendation needs matching to a person’s unique preferences (Study 5) and is eliminated in the case of human–AI hybrid decision making (i.e., augmented rather than artificial intelligence; Study 6).

These data are measured in the field while drilling by using a density log tool in the form of either a logging while drilling (LWD) technique or (more often) by wireline logging after the formations are drilled. This is due to operational limitations during the drilling process. Therefore, the objective of this study was to develop a predictive tool for estimating RHOB while drilling using an adaptive network-based fuzzy interference system (ANFIS), functional network (FN), and support vector machine (SVM). The proposed model uses the mechanical drilling constraints as feeding input parameters, and the conventional RHOB log data as an output parameter. These mechanical drilling parameters are usually measured while drilling, and their responses vary with different formations. A dataset of 2400 actual datapoints, obtained from a horizontal well in the Middle East, were used to build the proposed models. The obtained dataset was divided into a 70/30 ratio for model training and testing, respectively. The optimized ANFIS-based model outperformed the FN- and SVM-based models with a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.93, and average absolute percentage error (AAPE) of 0.81% between the predicted and measured RHOB values. These results demonstrate the reliability of the developed ANFIS model for predicting RHOB while drilling, based on the mechanical drilling parameters. Subsequently, the ANFIS-based model was validated using unseen data from another well within the same field.

Usually AC loss is calculated for pure sinusoidal current, while it is no longer accurate when current is nonsinusoidal. On the other hand, efficiency of cooling system in large scale power devices is dependent on accurate estimation and prediction of the heat load caused by AC loss in design stage. Therefore, estimation of nonsinusoidal AC loss of high temperature superconducting (HTS) material would be of great interest for designers of large-scale superconducting devices. In this paper, at first nonsinusoidal AC loss of a typical HTS tape was calculated under distorted currents using H-formulation finite element method. Then, a range of artificial intelligence (AI) models were implemented to predict AC loss of a typical HTS tape. In order to find the best and more adaptive AI model for nonsinusoidal AC loss prediction, different regression models are evaluated using Support Vector Machine regression model, Generalized Linear regression model, Decision Tree regression model, Feed Forward Neural Network based model, Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System based model, and Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) based model. In order to evaluate robustness of developed models cross-validation technique is implemented on experimental data. To compare the performance of different AI models, four prediction measures were used: Theil’s U coefficients (U_Accuracy and U_Quality), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Regression value (R-value). Obtained results show that best performance belongs to RBFNN based model and then ANFIS based model. U coefficients and RMSE values are obtained less than 0.005 and R-Value is become close to one by using RBFNN based model for testing data, which indicates high accuracy prediction performance.","",""

Our results apply to general multi-class classifiers that map from an input space into a decision space, including artificial neural networks used in deep learning applications. Two classes of attacks are considered. The first class involves adversarial examples and concerns the introduction of small perturbations of the input data that cause misclassification. The second class, introduced here for the first time and named stealth attacks, involves small perturbations to the AI system itself. Here the perturbed system produces whatever output is desired by the attacker on a specific small data set, perhaps even a single input, but performs as normal on a validation set (which is unknown to the attacker).We show that in both cases, i.e., in the case of an attack based on adversarial examples and in the case of a stealth attack, the dimensionality of the AI’s decision-making space is a major contributor to the AI’s susceptibility. For attacks based on adversarial examples, a second crucial parameter is the absence of local concentrations in the data probability distribution, a property known as Smeared Absolute Continuity. According to our findings, robustness to adversarial examples requires either (a) the data distributions in the AI’s feature space to have concentrated probability density functions or (b) the dimensionality of the AI’s decision variables to be sufficiently small. We also show how to construct stealth attacks on high-dimensional AI systems that are hard to spot unless the validation set is made exponentially large.","",""

Published studies were presented from two points of view: What medical aspects were covered? What AI/ML algorithms have been used? Methods We searched four electronic databases or studies that used AI/ML in hemodialysis (HD), peritoneal dialysis (PD), and kidney transplantation (KT). Sixty-nine studies were split into three categories: AI/ML and HD, PD, and KT, respectively. We identified 43 trials in the first group, 8 in the second, and 18 in the third. Then, studies were classified according to the type of algorithm. Results AI and HD trials covered: (a) dialysis service management, (b) dialysis procedure, (c) anemia management, (d) hormonal/dietary issues, and (e) arteriovenous fistula assessment. PD studies were divided into (a) peritoneal technique issues, (b) infections, and (c) cardiovascular event prediction. AI in transplantation studies were allocated into (a) management systems (ML used as pretransplant organ-matching tools), (b) predicting graft rejection, (c) tacrolimus therapy modulation, and (d) dietary issues. Conclusions Although guidelines are reluctant to recommend AI implementation in daily practice, there is plenty of evidence that AI/ML algorithms can predict better than nephrologists: volumes, Kt/V, and hypotension or cardiovascular events during dialysis. Altogether, these trials report a robust impact of AI/ML on quality of life and survival in G5D/T patients. In the coming years, one would probably witness the emergence of AI/ML devices that facilitate the management of dialysis patients, thus increasing the quality of life and survival.","",""

Although this classical approach demonstrated tremendous potential, subsequent advancements in hardware technology rendered artificial neural networks '(ANNs) the method of choice for machine vision in computational pathology'.

Cancer offers a unique context for medical decisions given not only its variegated forms with evolution of disease but also the need to take into account the individual condition of patients, their ability to receive treatment, and their responses to treatment. Challenges remain in the accurate detection, characterization, and monitoring of cancers despite improved technologies. Radiographic assessment of disease most commonly relies upon visual evaluations, the interpretations of which may be augmented by advanced computational analyses. In particular, artificial intelligence (AI) promises to make great strides in the qualitative interpretation of cancer imaging by expert clinicians, including volumetric delineation of tumors over time, extrapolation of the tumor genotype and biological course from its radiographic phenotype, prediction of clinical outcome, and assessment of the impact of disease and treatment on adjacent organs.

Unfortunately, the pursuit and use of such therapies have been hindered by a common challenge: patients with specific rare diseases are difficult to identify, especially if the conditions resemble more prevalent disorders. Cardiac amyloidosis is one such rare disease, which is characterized by deposition of misfolded proteins within the heart muscle resulting in heart failure and death. In recent years, specific therapies have emerged for cardiac amyloidosis and several more are under investigation, but because cardiac amyloidosis is mistaken for common forms of heart failure, it is typically diagnosed late in its course. As a possible solution, artificial intelligence methods could enable automated detection of rare diseases, but model performance must address low disease prevalence. Here we present an automated multi-modality pipeline for cardiac amyloidosis detection using two neural-network models; one using electrocardiograms (ECG) and the second using echocardiographic videos as input. These models were trained and validated on 3 and 5 academic medical centers (AMC), respectively, in the United States and Japan. Both models had excellent accuracy for detecting cardiac amyloidosis with C-statistics of 0.85-0.92 and 0.91-1.00 for the ECG and echocardiography models, respectively, with the latter outperforming expert diagnosis. Simulating deployment on 13,906 and 7775 patients with ECG-echocardiography paired data for AMC2 and AMC3 indicated a positive predictive value (PPV) for the ECG model of 4% and 3% at 61% and 54% recall, respectively. Pre-screening with ECG enhanced the echocardiography model performance from PPV 23% and 20% to PPV 58% and 53% at 64% recall, respectively for AMC2 and AMC3. In conclusion, we have developed a robust pipeline to augment detection of cardiac amyloidosis, which should serve as a generalizable strategy for other rare and intermediate frequency cardiac diseases with established or emerging therapies.","",""

Companies must clearly define anonymization and consent, and patients must be well-informed about their data usage. Data fed into algorithms must be made AI-ready by refining, purification, digitization and centralization. Finally, data must represent various demographics. AI needs to be safely integrated with radiologists-in-the-loop: guiding forming concepts of AI solutions and supervising training and feedback.

We hypothesize that classifiers incorporating both genome-wide gene-expression and pathogenetic variables can improve the therapeutic significance of DLBCL classification. To develop such refined classifiers, we performed targeted RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) with a commercially available next-generation sequencing (NGS) platform in a large cohort of 418 DLBCLs. Genetic and transcriptional data obtained by RNA-Seq in a single run were explored by state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) to develop a NGS-COO classifier for COO assignment and NGS survival models for clinical outcome prediction. The NGS-COO model built through applying AI in the training set was robust, showing high concordance with COO classification by either Affymetrix GeneChip microarray or the NanoString Lymph2Cx assay in 2 validation sets. Although the NGS-COO model was not trained for clinical outcome, the activated B-cell-like compared with the germinal-center B-cell-like subtype had significantly poorer survival. The NGS survival models stratified 30% high-risk patients in the validation set with poor survival as in the training set. These results demonstrate that targeted RNA-Seq coupled with AI deep learning techniques provides reproducible, efficient, and affordable assays for clinical application.

The issues of legal responsibility for the operation of artificial intelligence are revealed. For the purposes hereof, the methods of collecting and studying the singularities; generalizations; the methods of scientific abstraction; the methods of cognition of consistent patterns, as well as the method of objectivity, concreteness, pluralism and a whole range of other methods were used. The study has concluded that the artificial intelligence technology is an autonomous self-organizing computer-software or cyberphysical system with the ability and capability to think, learn, make decisions independently, perceive and model surrounding images and symbols, relationships, processes and implement its own decisions. The following general properties of artificial intelligence technologies have been defined: autonomy; the ability to perceive the conditions (situation), make and implement own decisions; the ability to adapt own behavior, to learn, to communicate with other artificial intelligence, to consider, accumulate and reproduce experience (including human experience). Within the present historical period, artificial intelligence technology should be considered as the object of right. The legal responsibility for the operation of artificial intelligence lies with the operator or another person who sets the parameters of its operation and controls its behavior. The creator (manufacturer) of artificial intelligence is also recognized as a responsible person. This conclusion makes it possible to enter the category of artificial intelligence in the legal field and determine the persons responsible for its poor-quality operation.","",""

Artificial intelligence (AI) can be used for semi-automated ECG analysis. The aim of this evaluation was to provide an overview of AI use in HF detection from ECG signals and to perform a meta-analysis of available studies. Methods and Results: An independent comprehensive search of the PubMed and Google Scholar database was conducted for articles dealing with the ability of AI to predict HF based on ECG signals. Only original articles published in peer-reviewed journals were considered. A total of five reports including 57,027 patients and 579,134 ECG datasets were identified including two sets of patient-level data and three with ECG-based datasets. The AI-processed ECG data yielded areas under the receiver operator characteristics curves between 0.92 and 0.99 to identify HF with higher values in ECG-based datasets. Applying a random-effects model, an sROC of 0.987 was calculated. Using the contingency tables led to diagnostic odds ratios ranging from 3.44 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 3.12–3.76] to 13.61 (95% CI = 13.14–14.08) also with lower values in patient-level datasets. The meta-analysis diagnostic odds ratio was 7.59 (95% CI = 5.85–9.34). Conclusions: The present meta-analysis confirms the ability of AI to predict HF from standard 12-lead ECG signals underlining the potential of such an approach. The observed overestimation of the diagnostic ability in artificial ECG databases compared to patient-level data stipulate the need for robust prospective studies.","",""

Yet, the explosion of nonstandardized reporting of high-performing algorithms are rendered useless without robust and streamlined implementation guidelines. The development of protocols and checklists will accelerate the translation of research publications to impact on patient care.   RECENT FINDINGS Beyond technological scepticism, we lack uniformity in analysing algorithmic performance generalizability, and benchmarking impacts across clinical settings. No regulatory guardrails have been set to minimize bias or optimize interpretability; no consensus clinical acceptability thresholds or systematized postdeployment monitoring has been set. Moreover, stakeholders with misaligned incentives deepen the landscape complexity especially when it comes to the requisite data integration and harmonization to advance the field. Therefore, despite increasing algorithmic accuracy and commoditization, the infamous 'implementation gap' persists. Open clinical data repositories have been shown to rapidly accelerate research, minimize redundancies and disseminate the expertise and knowledge required to overcome existing barriers. Drawing upon the longstanding success of existing governance frameworks and robust data use and sharing agreements, the ophthalmic community has tremendous opportunity in ushering artificial intelligence into medicine. By collaboratively building a powerful resource of open, anonymized multimodal ophthalmic data, the next generation of clinicians can advance data-driven eye care in unprecedented ways.   SUMMARY This piece demonstrates that with readily accessible data, immense progress can be achieved clinically and methodologically to realize artificial intelligence's impact on clinical care. Exponentially progressive network effects can be seen by consolidating, curating and distributing data amongst both clinicians and data scientists.","",""

High-resolution spectra of quasar absorption systems permit accurate measurements of fundamental constants out to high redshifts. The quality of new data demands completely objective and reproducible methods. We have developed a new fully automated Artificial Intelligence-based method capable of deriving optimal models of even the most complex absorption systems known. The AI structure is built around VPFIT, a well-developed and extensively-tested non-linear least-squares code. The new method forms a sophisticated parallelised system, eliminating human decision-making and hence bias. Here we describe the workings of such a system and apply it to synthetic spectra, in doing so establishing methods of importance for future analyses of VLT and ELT data. The results show that modelling line broadening for high-redshift absorption components should include both thermal and turbulent components. Failing to do so means it is easy to derive the wrong model and hence incorrect parameter estimates. We also argue that model non-uniqueness can be significant, such that it is not feasible to expect to derive an unambiguous estimate of the fine structure constant alpha from one or a small number of measurements. No matter how optimal the modelling method, it is a fundamental requirement to use a large sample of measurements to meaningfully constrain temporal or spatial alpha variation.","",""

We introduce SAT++, as a novel quantum programming paradigm, that can compile classical algorithms (implemented in classical programming languages) and execute them on quantum annealers. Moreover, we introduce a post-quantum error correction method that can find samples with significantly lower energy values, compared to the state-of-the-art techniques in quantum annealing. We also demonstrate that performing post-quantum error correction methods can make results of quantum annealers reproducible—i.e., more robust behavior of quantum annealers, compared to recent software and hardware advancements in quantum annealing. In addition, we offer to conjugate both optimization and sampling aspects of the quantum annealers and introduce two AI hybrid approaches. In reinforcement quantum annealing (RQA) scheme, an intelligent agent interacts with a quantum annealer that plays the stochastic environment role of learning automata and searches in the space of Hamiltonians, rather than exploring the Hilbert space of a given Ising model. In the same manner, greedy quantum annealing (GQA) is a novel model that utilizes quantum annealers to better select candidates in greedy algorithms. We experimentally demonstrate that our proposed AI hybrid approaches outperform the best-known techniques in quantum annealing, specifically when problems require longer chains for forming virtual qubits with higher connectivity. Furthermore, we introduce the theory of ensemble quantum annealing (EQA) that generates multiple (distinct) Ising Hamiltonians whose ground states are all identical to a solution to the problem of interest. Our experimental results reveal that applying EQA can significantly boost the performance of the quantum annealers. After benchmarking the D-Wave 2000Q quantum processors, as a proof-of-concept, we apply our proposed models on two real-world problems. As our first study case, we use SAT++ for factoring pseudo-prime numbers on a D-Wave quantum processor that can jeopardize the security of modern public-key cryptography systems. As our second case of study, we address the NP-hard problem of compressive sensing (i.e., the L0-norm problem of sparse recovery) through reducing the original problem of compressive sensing to Weighted-MAX-SAT instances, casting the L0-norm problem of binary compressive sensing to quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO), and proposing to solve the original problems of binary compressive sensing and binary compressive sensing with matrix uncertainty on quantum annealers.","",""

Algorithmic discrimination in healthcare occurs with surprising frequency. A well-known example is an algorithm used to identify candidates for “high risk care management” programs that routinely failed to refer racial minorities for these beneficial services.

Compared with what are now considered moretraditional analytical approaches, such as statistical prediction models, machine learning is seen as providing unique advantages; in particular, it may improve healthcare delivery because it can learn from millions of digitized patient charts or images, and so provide robust, reproducible, and rapid decision-support tools [8, 14]. Artificial intelligence has already transformed many aspects of daily life outside health care; machine-learning algorithms allow us to translate large pieces of text into any language, recognize speech, drive a car, make a plane take off or land, or detect banking fraud. The advantages of machine learning include the ability to analyze enormous amounts of data, capture complex nonlinear relationships among these data, and consider a wide range of data. It can handle structured data, similar to other statistical prediction methods, but machine learning can also analyze free text and images, as well as high-frequency sampled data streams such as those produced by wearable devices. In this respect, no approach other than artificial intelligence and machine learning has enabled the analysis of such data so far. These approaches have begun to show promise in orthopaedic surgery, specifically. For example, one recent study used machine learning to predict whether patients would achieve clinically important improvements in validated outcome scores 2 years after joint arthroplasty [5, 10], which is important in light of the fact that even experienced surgeons’ abilities in this sort of prediction for patients undergoing TKA are no better than a coin toss [6]. However, despite the hype and hopes about artificial intelligence, more-nuanced opinions have emerged [1, 13]. Identifying associations among data does not prevent confounding, and this may prevent us from translating modifiable factors flagged by algorithms into real targets for interventions. Additionally, despite the underlying idea that the more data we have to train an algorithm, the more accurate they are, the greed for more data does not always translate into more-accurate predictions [1]. Predicting what will occur in 1, 5, or 10 years may be difficult because all past data, not just available data, do not contain sufficient information. This may explain why machine-learning algorithms have often outperformed human experts in imaging or diagnostics, where most information is present in the data analyzed [8]. The advantage over moreclassic statistical models for longer-term risk prediction modeling is likely less evident [2].

The physical hydrologic models of flash flood prediction of any large area is very difficult to compute as it requires lot of data and time. Therefore remote sensing data based models (from statistical to machine learning) have become highly popular due to open data access and lesser prediction times. There is a continuous effort to improve the prediction accuracy of these models through introducing new methods. This study is focused on flash flood modeling through novel hybrid machine learning models, which can improve the prediction accuracy. The hybrid machine learning ensemble approaches that combine the three meta-classifiers (Real AdaBoost, Random Subspace, and MultiBoosting) with J48 (a tree-based algorithm that can be used to evaluate the behavior of the attribute vector for any defined number of instances) were used in the Gorganroud River Basin of Iran to assess flood susceptibility (FS). A total of 426 flood positions as dependent variables and a total of 14 flood conditioning factors (FCFs) as independent variables were used to model the FS. Several threshold-dependent and independent statistical tests were applied to verify the performance and predictive capability of these machine learning models, such as the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of the success rate curve (SRC) and prediction rate curve (PRC), efficiency (E), root-mean square-error (RMSE), and true skill statistics (TSS). The valuation of the FCFs was done using AdaBoost, frequency ratio (FR), and Boosted Regression Tree (BRT) models. In the flooding of the study area, altitude, land use/land cover (LU/LC), distance to stream, normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI), and rainfall played important roles. The Random Subspace J48 (RSJ48) ensemble method with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.931 (SRC), 0.951 (PRC), E of 0.89, sensitivity of 0.87, and TSS of 0.78, has become the most effective ensemble in predicting the FS. The FR technique also showed good performance and reliability for all models. Map removal sensitivity analysis (MRSA) revealed that the FS maps have the highest sensitivity to elevation. Based on the findings of the validation methods, the FS maps prepared using the machine learning ensemble techniques have high robustness and can be used to advise flood management initiatives in flood-prone areas.","",""

Despite major advances in our understanding of the molecular and genetic basis of MPNs, the morphological assessment of bone marrow trephines (BMT) is critical in differentiating MPN subtypes and their reactive mimics. However, morphological assessment is heavily constrained by a reliance on subjective, qualitative, and poorly reproducible criteria. To improve the morphological assessment of MPNs, we have developed a machine learning approach for the automated identification, quantitative analysis, and abstract representation of megakaryocyte features using reactive/nonneoplastic BMT samples (n = 43) and those from patients with established diagnoses of essential thrombocythemia (n = 45), polycythemia vera (n = 18), or myelofibrosis (n = 25). We describe the application of an automated workflow for the identification and delineation of relevant histological features from routinely prepared BMTs. Subsequent analysis enabled the tissue diagnosis of MPN with a high predictive accuracy (area under the curve = 0.95) and revealed clear evidence of the potential to discriminate between important MPN subtypes. Our method of visually representing abstracted megakaryocyte features in the context of analyzed patient cohorts facilitates the interpretation and monitoring of samples in a manner that is beyond conventional approaches. The automated BMT phenotyping approach described here has significant potential as an adjunct to standard genetic and molecular testing in established or suspected MPN patients, either as part of the routine diagnostic pathway or in the assessment of disease progression/response to treatment.","",""

As the distances between people have been greatly shortened, there has been more general demand for the provision of personalized services aimed at groups instead of individuals. The existing methods for capturing group-level preference features from individuals have mostly been established via aggregation and face two challenges: 1) secure data management workflows are absent and 2) implicit preference feedback is ignored. To tackle these current difficulties, this article proposes secure AIoT for implicit group recommendations (SAIoT-GRs). For the hardware module, a secure Internet of Things structure is developed as the bottom support platform. For the software module, a collaborative Bayesian network model and noncooperative game are introduced as algorithms. This secure AIoT architecture is able to maximize the advantages of the two modules. In addition, a large number of experiments are carried out to evaluate the performance of SAIoT-GR in terms of efficiency and robustness.","",""

Materials and Methods PubMed MEDLINE and Embase databases were searched to identify original research articles published between January 1, 2018 and August 17, 2018 that investigated the performance of AI algorithms that analyze medical images to provide diagnostic decisions. Eligible articles were evaluated to determine 1) whether the study used external validation rather than internal validation, and in case of external validation, whether the data for validation were collected, 2) with diagnostic cohort design instead of diagnostic case-control design, 3) from multiple institutions, and 4) in a prospective manner. These are fundamental methodologic features recommended for clinical validation of AI performance in real-world practice. The studies that fulfilled the above criteria were identified. We classified the publishing journals into medical vs. non-medical journal groups. Then, the results were compared between medical and non-medical journals. Results Of 516 eligible published studies, only 6% (31 studies) performed external validation. None of the 31 studies adopted all three design features: diagnostic cohort design, the inclusion of multiple institutions, and prospective data collection for external validation. No significant difference was found between medical and non-medical journals. Conclusion Nearly all of the studies published in the study period that evaluated the performance of AI algorithms for diagnostic analysis of medical images were designed as proof-of-concept technical feasibility studies and did not have the design features that are recommended for robust validation of the real-world clinical performance of AI algorithms.","",""

The proposed management system is designed to manage the power flow between the hybrid power system and energy storage elements in order to satisfy the load requirements based on artificial neural network (ANN) and fuzzy logic controllers.   The neural network controller is employed to achieve the maximum power point (MPP) for different types of photovoltaic (PV) panels, based on Levenberg Marquardt learning algorithm. The statistical analysis of the results indicates that the R2 value for the testing set was 0.99.   The advance fuzzy logic controller is developed to distribute the power among the hybrid system and to manage the charge and discharge current flow for performance optimization.  The developed management system performance was assessed using a hybrid system comprises PV panels, wind turbine, battery storage, and proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). To improve the generating performance of the PEMFC and prolong its life, stack temperature is controlled by a fuzzy logic controller.  Moreover, perturb and observe (P&O) algorithm with two different controller techniques - the linear PI and the non-linear passivity-based controller (PBC) - are provided for a comparison with the proposed MPPT controller system. The comparison revealed the robustness of the proposed PV control system for solar irradiance and load resistance changes.  Real-time measured parameters and practical load profiles are used as inputs for the developed management system. The proposed model and its control strategy offer a proper tool for optimizing the hybrid power system performance, such as the one used in smart-house applications.  The research work also led to a new approach in monitoring PV power stations. The monitoring system enables system degradation early detection by calculating the residual difference between the model predicted and the actual measured power parameters. Measurements were taken over 21 month’s period; using hourly average irradiance and cell temperature. Good agreement was achieved between the theoretical simulation and the real time measurement taken the online grid connected solar power plant.","",""

A computer system able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages. Artificial Intelligence has made it possible. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning, and machine learning is a subset of AI, which is an umbrella term for any computer program that does something smart. In other words, all machine learning is AI, but not all AI is machine learning, and so forth. Machine Learning represents a key evolution in the fields of computer science, data analysis, software engineering, and artificial intelligence. Machine learning (ML)is a vibrant field of research, with a range of exciting areas for further development across different methods and applications. These areas include algorithmic interpretability, robustness, privacy, fairness, inference of causality, human-machine interaction, and security. The goal of ML is never to make “perfect” guesses, because ML deals in domains where there is no such thing. The goal is to make guesses that are good enough to be useful. Deep learning is a particular kind of machine learning that achieves great power and flexibility by learning to represent the world as nested hierarchy of concepts, with each concept defined in relation to simpler concepts, and more abstract representations computed in terms of less abstract ones. This paper gives an overview of artificial intelligence, machine learning & deep learning techniques and compare these techniques.","",""

The accurate and more reliable prediction of TDG has a very significant role in preserving the diversity of aquatic organisms and reducing the phenomenon of fish deaths. Herein, two machine learning approaches called support vector regression (SVR) and extreme learning machine (ELM) have been applied to predict the saturated TDG% at USGS 14150000 and USGS 14181500 stations which are located in the USA. For the USGS 14150000 station, the recorded samples from 13 October 2016 to 14 March 2019 (75%) were used for training set, and the rest from 15 March 2019 to 13 October 2019 (25%) were used for testing requirements. Similarly, for USGS 14181500 station, the hourly data samples which covered the period from 9 June 2017 till 11 March 2019 were used for calibrating the models and from 12 March 2019 until 9 October 2019 were used for testing the predictive models. Eight input combinations based on different parameters have been established as well as nine statistical performance measures have been used for evaluating the accuracy of adopted models, for instance, not limited, correlation of determination (        R      2        ), mean absolute relative error (MAE), and uncertainty at 95% (        U      95        ). The obtained results of the study for both stations revealed that the ELM managed efficiently to estimate the TDG in comparison to SVR technique. For USGS 14181500 station, the statistical measures for ELM (SVR) were, respectively, reported as         R      2        of 0.986 (0.986), MAE of 0.316 (0.441), and         U      95        of 3.592 (3.869). Lastly, for USGS 14181500 station, the statistical measures for ELM (SVR) were, respectively, reported as         R      2        of 0.991 (0.991), MAE of 0.338 (0.396), and         U      95        of 0.832 (0.837). In addition, ELM’s training process computational time is stated to be much shorter than that of SVM. The results also showed that the temperature parameter was the most significant variable that influenced TDG relative to the other parameters. Overall, the proposed model (ELM) proved to be an appropriate and efficient computer-assisted technology for saturated TDG modeling that will contribute to the basic knowledge of environmental considerations.","",""

First, two outstanding challenges facing PLS designers are identified by analyzing the fundamental assumptions regarding eavesdroppers and wireless channels. Accordingly, two enhancement schemes are designed by reaping the benefits offered by AI and EC. Specifically, a novel secure resource management framework is developed to enhance the adaptability of an optimization-based PLS paradigm, and a robust physical-layer key generation method is designed to cope with reciprocity failure. Finally, we discuss a coordinated defense architecture with multi-layer, multi-domain, and multi-dimension, which is expected to exploit the compatibility and complementarity of the existing PLS methods.","",""
