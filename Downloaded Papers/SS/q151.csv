The key idea is to recursively propagate and aggregate information along the edges of the given graph. Despite their success, however, the existing GNNs are usually sensitive to the quality of the input graph. Real-world graphs are often noisy and contain task-irrelevant edges, which may lead to suboptimal generalization performance in the learned GNN models. In this paper, we propose PTDNet, a parameterized topological denoising network, to improve the robustness and generalization performance of GNNs by learning to drop task-irrelevant edges. PTDNet prunes task-irrelevant edges by penalizing the number of edges in the sparsified graph with parameterized networks. To take into consideration the topology of the entire graph, the nuclear norm regularization is applied to impose the low-rank constraint on the resulting sparsified graph for better generalization. PTDNet can be used as a key component in GNN models to improve their performances on various tasks, such as node classification and link prediction. Experimental studies on both synthetic and benchmark datasets show that PTDNet can improve the performance of GNNs significantly and the performance gain becomes larger for more noisy datasets.","",""

While robust control methods provide rigorous guarantees on system stability under certain worst-case disturbances, they often result in simple controllers that perform poorly in the average (non-worst) case. In contrast, nonlinear control methods trained using deep learning have achieved state-of-the-art performance on many control tasks, but often lack robustness guarantees. We propose a technique that combines the strengths of these two approaches: a generic nonlinear control policy class, parameterized by neural networks, that nonetheless enforces the same provable robustness criteria as robust control. Specifically, we show that by integrating custom convex-optimization-based projection layers into a nonlinear policy, we can construct a provably robust neural network policy class that outperforms robust control methods in the average (non-adversarial) setting. We demonstrate the power of this approach on several domains, improving in performance over existing robust control methods and in stability over (non-robust) RL methods.","",""

In this paper, we introduce a general model of deep neural network (DNN)-based modulation classifiers for single-input single-output (SISO) systems. Its feasibility is analyzed using maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) criterion and its robustness to uncertain noise conditions is compared to that of the conventional maximum likelihood (ML)-based classifiers. To reduce the design and training cost of DNN classifiers, a simple but effective pre-processing method is introduced and adopted. Furthermore, featuring multiple recurrent neural network (RNN) layers, the DNN modulation classifier is realized. Simulation results show that the proposed RNN-based classifier is robust to the uncertain noise conditions, and the performance of it approaches to that of the ideal ML classifier with perfect channel and noise information. Moreover, with a much lower complexity, it outperforms the existing ML-based classifiers, specifically, expectation maximization (EM) and expectation conditional maximization (ECM) classifiers which iteratively estimate channel and noise parameters. In addition, the proposed classifier is shown to be invariant to the signal distortion such as frequency offset. Furthermore, the adopted pre-processing method is shown to accelerate the training process of our proposed classifier, thus reducing the training cost. Lastly, the computational complexity of our proposed classifier is analyzed and compared to other traditional ones, which further demonstrates its overall advantage.","",""

Instead, we model randomness under the framework of Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) to formally learn the posterior distribution of models in a scalable way. Second, we formulate the mini-max problem in BNN to learn the best model distribution under adversarial attacks, leading to an adversarial-trained Bayesian neural net.

Recently, radio frequency (RF) fingerprint-based identification schemes have attracted wide attention as they extract the inherent characteristics of hardware circuits which is very hard to forge. However, existing RF fingerprint-based approaches face the problems of unstable region of interest (ROI), high-cost feature design, and incomplete automation. To address these problems, this paper proposes a multisampling convolutional neural network (MSCNN) to extract RF fingerprint from the selected ROI for classifying ZigBee devices. A signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) adaptive ROI selection algorithm is also developed to alleviate the effect of semi-steady behavior of ZigBee devices owing to sleep mode switching. The proposed MSCNN uses multiple downsampling transformations for multiscale feature extraction and classification automatically. To validate and evaluate the performance of our proposed method, we design a testbed consisting of one low-cost universal software radio peripheral (USRP) as the receiver and 54 CC2530 devices as targets for identification. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the feasibility and reliability of MSCNN both in the line-of-sight (LOS) scenarios and non-LOS (NLOS) scenarios.

Motivated by the observations that humans are highly effective and consume little power whilst analyzing complex audio scenes, we propose a biologically plausible ASC framework, namely SOM-SNN. This framework uses the unsupervised self-organizing map (SOM) for representing frequency contents embedded within the acoustic signals, followed by an event-based spiking neural network (SNN) for spatiotemporal spiking pattern classification.

Although classical MPPT techniques offer simplified structure and implementation, their performance is degraded when compared with artificial intelligence-based techniques especially during partial shading and rapidly changing environmental conditions. Artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms feature several capabilities such as: (i) off-line training, (ii) nonlinear mapping, (iii) high-speed response, (iv) robust operation, (v) less computational effort and (vi) compact solution for multiple-variable problems. Hence, ANN algorithms have been widely applied as PV MPPT techniques. Among various available ANN-based PV MPPT techniques, very limited references gather those techniques as a survey. Neither classification nor comparisons between those competitors exist. Moreover, no detailed analysis of the system performance under those techniques has been previously discussed. This study presents a detailed survey for ANN based PV MPPT techniques. The authors propose new categorisation for ANN PV MPPT techniques based on controller structure and input variables. In addition, a detailed comparison between those techniques from several points of view, such as ANN structure, experimental verification and transient/steady-state performance is presented.

Traditionally, many target detection models based on sliding-window fashion were developed and achieved acceptable performance, but these models are time-consuming in the detection phase. Recently, with the great success of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in computer vision, many state-of-the-art detectors have been designed based on deep CNNs. However, these CNN-based detectors are inefficient when applied in aerial image data due to the fact that the existing CNN-based models struggle with small-size object detection and precise localization. To improve the detection accuracy without decreasing speed, we propose a CNN-based detection model combining two independent convolutional neural networks, where the first network is applied to generate a set of vehicle-like regions from multi-feature maps of different hierarchies and scales. Because the multi-feature maps combine the advantage of the deep and shallow convolutional layer, the first network performs well on locating the small targets in aerial image data. Then, the generated candidate regions are fed into the second network for feature extraction and decision making. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on the Vehicle Detection in Aerial Imagery (VEDAI) dataset and Munich vehicle dataset. The proposed cascaded detection model yields high performance, not only in detection accuracy but also in detection speed.","",""

How to enhance the robustness of GCNs remains a critical open problem. To address this problem, we propose Robust GCN (RGCN), a novel model that ""fortifies'' GCNs against adversarial attacks. Specifically, instead of representing nodes as vectors, our method adopts Gaussian distributions as the hidden representations of nodes in each convolutional layer. In this way, when the graph is attacked, our model can automatically absorb the effects of adversarial changes in the variances of the Gaussian distributions. Moreover, to remedy the propagation of adversarial attacks in GCNs, we propose a variance-based attention mechanism, i.e. assigning different weights to node neighborhoods according to their variances when performing convolutions.

For the robust stabilisation problem, a state feedback controller is designed to ensure global robust stability of the closed-loop form of neural network about its equilibrium point for all admissible uncertainties. In addition, to the requirement of the global robust stability, a prescribed H∞ performance level for all delays to satisfy both the lower bound and upper bound of the interval time-varying delay is required to be obtained. Through construction of a new Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional, a robust H∞ control scheme is presented in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs).

Neural dedifferentiation is held to reflect a breakdown in the functional specificity of brain regions and networks that compromises the fidelity of neural representations supporting episodic memory and related cognitive functions. The evidence for age-related dedifferentiation is robust when it is operationalized as neural selectivity for different categories of perceptual stimuli or as decreased segregation or modularity of resting-state functional brain networks. Neural dedifferentiation for perceptual categories appears to demonstrate a negative, age-invariant relationship with performance on tests of memory and fluid processing. Whether this pattern extends to network-level measures of dedifferentiation cannot currently be determined due to insufficient evidence.

The new controller combines the merits of the H∞ control with robust performance and the WNN control (WNNC) which combines the capability of NNs for online learning ability and the capability of wavelet decomposition for identification ability. The online trained WNNC is utilized to predict the uncertain system dynamics to relax the requirement of uncertainty bound in the design of the H∞ controller. The WNNC generates an adaptive control signal to attain robust performance regardless of parameter uncertainties (PU) and load disturbances.

We introduce a neural network architecture, which performs multichannel filtering in the first layer of the network, and show that this network learns to be robust to varying target speaker direction of arrival, performing as well as a model that is given oracle knowledge of the true target speaker direction. Next, we show how performance can be improved by factoring  the first layer to separate the multichannel spatial filtering operation from a single channel filterbank which computes a frequency decomposition. We also introduce an adaptive variant, which updates the spatial filter coefficients at each time frame based on the previous inputs. Finally, we demonstrate that these approaches can be implemented more efficiently in the frequency domain.

Clustering is an efficient approach to simplify the network structure and to alleviate the scalability problem. One method to create clusters is to use weakly connected dominating sets (WCDSs). Finding the minimum WCDS in an arbitrary graph is an NP-complete problem. We propose a neural network model to find the minimum WCDS in a wireless sensor network. We present a directed convergence algorithm. The new algorithm outperforms the normal convergence algorithm both in efficiency and in the quality of solutions. Moreover, it is shown that the neural network is robust. We investigate the scalability of the neural network model by testing it on a range of sized graphs and on a range of transmission radii. Compared with Guha and Khuller's centralized algorithm, the proposed neural network with directed convergency achieves better results when the transmission radius is short, and equal performance when the transmission radius becomes larger. The parallel version of the neural network model takes time O(d) , where d is the maximal degree in the graph corresponding to the sensor network, while the centralized algorithm takes O(n 2). We also investigate the effect of the transmission radius on the size of WCDS. The results show that it is important to select a suitable transmission radius to make the network stable and to extend the lifespan of the network. The proposed model can be used on sink nodes in sensor networks, so that a sink node can inform the nodes to be a coordinator (clusterhead) in the WCDS obtained by the algorithm.

Recent advances in feed-forward deep neural networks (DNNs) have offered improved object recognition performance. Sparse feature learning in feed-forward DNN models offers further improvement in performance when compared to the earlier handcrafted techniques. However, the depth of the feed-forward DNNs and the computational complexity of the models increase proportional to the challenges posed by the facial expression recognition problem. The feed-forward DNN architectures do not exploit another important learning paradigm, known as recurrency, which is ubiquitous in the human visual system. Consequently, this paper proposes a novel biologically relevant sparse-deep simultaneous recurrent network (S-DSRN) for robust facial expression recognition. The feature sparsity is obtained by adopting dropout learning in the proposed DSRN as opposed to usual handcrafting of additional penalty terms for the sparse representation of data. Theoretical analysis of S-DSRN shows that the dropout learning offers desirable properties such as sparsity, and prevents the model from overfitting. Experimental results also suggest that the proposed method yields better performance accuracy, requires reduced number of parameters, and offers reduced computational complexity than that of the previously reported state-of-the-art feed-forward DNNs using two of the most widely used publicly available facial expression data sets. Furthermore, we show that by combining the proposed neural architecture with a state-of-the-art metric learning technique significantly improves the overall recognition performance.

We show that these representations become increasingly insensitive to small perturbations in the input with increasing network depth, which leads to better speech recognition performance with deeper networks. We also show that DNNs cannot extrapolate to test samples that are substantially different from the training examples. If the training data are sufficiently representative, however, internal features learned by the DNN are relatively stable with respect to speaker differences, bandwidth differences, and environment distortion. This enables DNN-based recognizers to perform as well or better than state-of-the-art systems based on GMMs or shallow networks without the need for explicit model adaptation or feature normalization.","",""

A neighborhood attraction, which is dependent on the relative location and features of neighboring pixels, is shown to improve the segmentation performance dramatically. The degree of attraction is optimized by a neural-network model.

The Taguchi method is inserted between crossover and mutation operations of a TGA. Then, the systematic reasoning ability of the Taguchi method is incorporated in the crossover operations to select the better genes to achieve crossover, and consequently enhance the genetic algorithms. Therefore, the HTGA approach can be more robust, statistically sound, and quickly convergent. First, the authors evaluate the performance of the presented HTGA approach by studying some global numerical optimization problems. Then, the presented HTGA approach is effectively applied to solve three examples on forecasting the sunspot numbers, tuning the associative memory, and solving the XOR problem. The numbers of hidden nodes and the links of the feedforward neural network are chosen by increasing them from small numbers until the learning performance is good enough. As a result, a partially connected feedforward neural network can be obtained after tuning. This implies that the cost of implementation of the neural network can be reduced. In these studied problems of tuning both network structure and parameters of a feedforward neural network, there are many parameters and numerous local optima so that these studied problems are challenging enough for evaluating the performances of any proposed GA-based approaches.

Introduction Many classical computer vision tasks have enjoyed agreat breakthrough, primarily due to the large amount oftraining data and the application of deep convolution neu-ral networks (CNN) [8]. In the most recent ILSVRC 2014competition [11], CNN-based solutions have achieved near-human accuracies in image classiﬁcation, localization anddetection tasks [14,16].Accompanying this progress are studies trying to under-stand what CNN has learnt internally and what contributeto its success [2,13,17]. By design, layers within the net-work have progressively larger receptive ﬁeld sizes, allow-ing them to learn more complex features. Another key pointis the shift-invariance property, that a pattern in the inputcan be recognized regardless of its position [9]. Pooling lay-ers contribute resilience to slight deformation as well smallscale change [12].However, it is evident that CNN deals with shift-variancefar better than scale-invariance [3]. Not dealing with scale-invariance well poses a direct conﬂict to the design philos-ophy of CNN, in that higher layers may see and thus cap-tures features of certain plain patterns simply because theyare larger at the input, not because they are more complex.In other words, there is no alignments between in the posi-tion of a ﬁlter and the complexity it captures. What is more,there are other invariance that CNN does not deal with inter-nally. Examples include rotations and ﬂips (since featuresof natural objects are mostly symmetric).A brutal force solution would be to make the networklarger by introducing more ﬁlters to cope with scale vari-ations of the same feature, accompanied by scale-jitteringthe input images, often by order of magnitude. This is, infact, the popular practice today [1,8,14]. It is true even forproposals that directly deal with this problem. For example,[3] drives the CNN with crops of different size and positionswith three differnt scales, and then uses VLAD pooling toproduce a feature summary of the patches.We explore a radically different approach that is alsosimple. Observing that ﬁlters that detect the same patternbut with different scales bear strong relationship, we adopt amulti-column design and designate each column to special-ize on certain scales. We call our system SiCNN (Scale-invariant CNN). Unlike a conventional multi-column CNN,ﬁlters in SiCNN are strongly regulated among columns.The goal is to make the network resilient to scale variancewithout blowing up number of free parameters, and thus re-duce the need of jittering the input.We performed detailed analysis and veriﬁed that SiCNNexhibits the desired behavior. For example, the column thatdeals with larger scale is indeed activated by input patternswith the larger scaling factor, and the system as a wholebecomes less sensitive to scale variance. On unaugmentedCIFAR-10 dataset [7], our method produces the best re-1","",""

So far, this intuition is based on perturbations to external stimuli such as the images to be classified. Here we explore the robustness of convolutional neural networks to perturbations to the internal weights and architecture of the network itself. We show that convolutional networks are surprisingly robust to a number of internal perturbations in the higher convolutional layers but the bottom convolutional layers are much more fragile. For instance, Alexnet shows less than a 30% decrease in classification performance when randomly removing over 70% of weight connections in the top convolutional or dense layers but performance is almost at chance with the same perturbation in the first convolutional layer. Finally, we suggest further investigations which could continue to inform the robustness of convolutional networks to internal perturbations.","",""

We first show that networks fine-tuned on distorted data greatly outperform the original networks when tested on distorted data. However, fine-tuned networks perform poorly on quality distortions that they have not been trained for. We propose a mixture of experts ensemble method that is robust to different types of distortions. The ""experts"" in our model are trained on a particular type of distortion. The output of the model is a weighted sum of the expert models, where the weights are determined by a separate gating network. The gating network is trained to predict optimal weights for a particular distortion type and level. During testing, the network is blind to the distortion level and type, yet can still assign appropriate weights to the expert models. We additionally investigate weight sharing methods for the mixture model and show that improved performance can be achieved with a large reduction in the number of unique network parameters.","",""

The purpose of this paper is to improve the controller robustness by applying the neural network (NN) technique to compensate for the uncertainties in the robot model. NN control techniques are applied to two impedance control methods: torque-based and position-based impedance control, which are distinguished by the way of the impedance functions being implemented. A novel error signal is proposed for the NN training. In addition, a trajectory modification algorithm is developed to determine the reference trajectory when the environment stiffness is unknown. The robustness analysis of this algorithm to force sensor noise and inaccurate environment position measurement is also presented. The performances of the two NN impedance control schemes are compared by computer simulations. Simulation results based on a three-degrees-of-freedom robot show that highly robust position/force tracking can be achieved in the presence of large uncertainties and force sensor noise.","",""
